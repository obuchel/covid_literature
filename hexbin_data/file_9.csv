9,9,9,Technical Description of RODS: A Real-time Public Health Surveillance System,19.3714,0.9047333,2003-09-01,"This report describes the design and implementation of the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system, a computer-based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks. Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the Health Level 7 (HL7) message protocol. The data are sent in real time. RODS automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. RODS was used during the 2002 Winter Olympics and currently operates in two states—Pennsylvania and Utah. It has been and continues to be a resource for implementing, evaluating, and applying new methods of public health surveillance.","Tsui, Fu-Chiang; Espino, Jeremy U.; Dato, Virginia M.; Gesteland, Per H.; Hutman, Judith; Wagner, Michael M.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,9,30
935,935,935,Identification of pneumonia and influenza deaths using the death certificate pipeline,19.372105,0.5176,2012-05-08,"BACKGROUND: Death records are a rich source of data, which can be used to assist with public surveillance and/or decision support. However, to use this type of data for such purposes it has to be transformed into a coded format to make it computable. Because the cause of death in the certificates is reported as free text, encoding the data is currently the single largest barrier of using death certificates for surveillance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a pipeline, composed of a detection rule and a natural language processor, for the real time encoding of death certificates using the identification of pneumonia and influenza cases as an example and demonstrating that its accuracy is comparable to existing methods. RESULTS: A Death Certificates Pipeline (DCP) was developed to automatically code death certificates and identify pneumonia and influenza cases. The pipeline used MetaMap to code death certificates from the Utah Department of Health for the year 2008. The output of MetaMap was then accessed by detection rules which flagged pneumonia and influenza cases based on the Centers of Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The output from the DCP was compared with the current method used by the CDC and with a keyword search. Recall, precision, positive predictive value and F-measure with respect to the CDC method were calculated for the two other methods considered here. The two different techniques compared here with the CDC method showed the following recall/ precision results: DCP: 0.998/0.98 and keyword searching: 0.96/0.96. The F-measure were 0.99 and 0.96 respectively (DCP and keyword searching). Both the keyword and the DCP can run in interactive form with modest computer resources, but DCP showed superior performance. CONCLUSION: The pipeline proposed here for coding death certificates and the detection of cases is feasible and can be extended to other conditions. This method provides an alternative that allows for coding free-text death certificates in real time that may increase its utilization not only in the public health domain but also for biomedical researchers and developers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study did not involved any clinical trials.","Davis, Kailah; Staes, Catherine; Duncan, Jeff; Igo, Sean; Facelli, Julio C",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,9,22
988,988,988,Measuring healthcare preparedness: an all-hazards approach,19.356386,0.9810221,2012-10-25,"In a paper appearing in this issue, Adini, et al. describe a struggle familiar to many emergency planners—the challenge of planning for all scenarios. The authors contend that all-hazards, or capabilities-based planning, in which a set of core capabilities applicable to numerous types of events is developed, is a more efficient way to achieve general health care system emergency preparedness than scenario-based planning. Essentially, the core of what is necessary to plan for and respond to one kind of disaster (e.g. a biologic event) is also necessary for planning and responding to other types of disasters, allowing for improvements in planning and maximizing efficiencies. While Adini, et al. have advanced the science of health care emergency preparedness through their consideration of 490 measures to assess preparedness, a shorter set of validated preparedness measures would support the dual goals of accountability and improved outcomes and could provide the basis for determining which actions in the name of preparedness really matter.","Marcozzi, David E; Lurie, Nicole",Isr J Health Policy Res,9,5
1031,1031,1031,"The impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 compared with seasonal influenza on intensive care admissions in New South Wales, Australia, 2007 to 2010: a time series analysis",19.395527,0.76089776,2012-10-12,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the 2009 epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 resulted in increased admissions to intensive care. The annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate, as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed. We used a population-based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza. METHODS: For 2007 to 2010, time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Serfling approach, a time series method, was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics. The contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period. RESULTS: The estimated excess rate of influenza-associated respiratory ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007 (2.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1) than the pandemic year, 2009 (0.76/100,000, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.48). In 2009, the highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds (2.9/100,000, 95% CI 2.2 to 3.6), while in 2007, the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older (9.5/100,000, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.8). In 2009, the excess rate was 17/100,000 (95% CI 14 to 20) in Aboriginal people and 14/100,000 (95% CI 13 to 16) in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009, overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007. Thus, the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under-recognised. In 2009, high ICU use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults, and Aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over-represented in ICUs. Greater emphasis on prevention of serious illness in Aboriginal people and pregnant women should be a priority in pandemic planning.","Schaffer, Andrea; Muscatello, David; Cretikos, Michelle; Gilmour, Robin; Tobin, Sean; Ward, James",BMC Public Health,9,5
1694,1694,1694,"A comparison of smartphones to paper-based questionnaires for routine influenza sentinel surveillance, Kenya, 2011–2012",19.241074,0.7606018,2014-12-24,"BACKGROUND: For disease surveillance, manual data collection using paper-based questionnaires can be time consuming and prone to errors. We introduced smartphone data collection to replace paper-based data collection for an influenza sentinel surveillance system in four hospitals in Kenya. We compared the quality, cost and timeliness of data collection between the smartphone data collection system and the paper-based system. METHODS: Since 2006, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KEMRI/CDC) conducted hospital-based sentinel surveillance for influenza in Kenya. In May 2011, the MOH replaced paper-based collection with an electronic data collection system using Field Adapted Survey Toolkit (FAST) on HTC Touch Pro2 smartphones at four sentinel sites. We compared 880 paper-based questionnaires dated Jan 2010-Jun 2011 and 880 smartphone questionnaires dated May 2011-Jun 2012 from the four surveillance sites. For each site, we compared the quality, cost and timeliness of each data collection system. RESULTS: Incomplete records were more likely seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 7, 95% CI: 4.4-10.3). Errors and inconsistent answers were also more likely to be seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (aIRR: 25, 95% CI: 12.5-51.8). Smartphone data was uploaded into the database in a median time of 7 days while paper-based data took a median of 21 days to be entered (p < 0.01). It cost USD 1,501 (9.4%) more to establish the smartphone data collection system ($17,500) than the pen-and-paper system (USD $15,999). During two years, however, the smartphone data collection system was $3,801 (7%) less expensive to operate ($50,200) when compared to pen-and-paper system ($54,001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to paper-based data collection, an electronic data collection system produced fewer incomplete data, fewer errors and inconsistent responses and delivered data faster. Although start-up costs were higher, the overall costs of establishing and running the electronic data collection system were lower compared to paper-based data collection system. Electronic data collection using smartphones has potential to improve timeliness, data integrity and reduce costs.","Njuguna, Henry N; Caselton, Deborah L; Arunga, Geoffrey O; Emukule, Gideon O; Kinyanjui, Dennis K; Kalani, Rosalia M; Kinkade, Carl; Muthoka, Phillip M; Katz, Mark A; Mott, Joshua A",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,9,22

In inhibiting viral infections by RNA interference, both viral targets and cellular proteins have been evaluated. Most of the early studies in this field had chosen viral targets for RNA interference. However, recent efforts are mainly focusing on cellular proteins for RNA silencing due to the realization that a variety of viral responses substantially minimize siRNA effects. With the application of siRNA approaching, many new cellular targets relevant to HIV infection have been identified. The value of siRNA/shRNA in the treatment of AIDS is largely dependent on better understanding of the biology of HIV replication. Efforts in the identification of cellular processes with the employment of siRNA/shRNA have shed some new lights on our understanding of how HIV infection occurs. Furthermore, the relative specific effects and simplicity of design makes siRNA/shRNA themselves to be favorable drug leads.","Zhang, Jia; Wu, Y. O.; Xiao, Li; Li, Kai; Chen, L.

Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden, massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia(3,4) or acute respiratory distress syndrome(5,6) often recover full pulmonary function within six months. Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process(7). Here we show that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.

Limiting the disruption of critical infrastructures during a pandemic is important for the survival and health of society (i.e., electricity, water, and food) as most medical and public health responses to a pandemic depend on these infrastructures. The studies that have looked at this issue have highlighted alarming gaps in preparedness. This study used a system dynamics model to demonstrate the likely effects of a pandemic on the USA’s food system. The model reveals that a severe pandemic with greater than a 25 % reduction in labor availability can create significant and widespread food shortages. The Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 has caused severe food shortages in West Africa, which are similar to the effects that this model predicts in the USA. The likely effects of the reduction in the amount of available food are difficult to specifically predict; however, it is likely to have severe negative consequences on society. The resilience of the food system must be improved against this hazard and others.

Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.","Moon, Harley W.; Bunn, Thomas O.",Vaccine,9,30

In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration.

Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.","Li, Chun; He, Jianhua; Duan, Xingwu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,9,1

The device operates by shuffling the smallest cation, the proton, in a three-terminal configuration. It has a channel of active material, WO(3). A solid proton reservoir layer, PdH(x), also serves as the gate terminal. A proton conducting solid electrolyte separates the channel and the reservoir. By protonation/deprotonation, we modulate the electronic conductivity of the channel over seven orders of magnitude, obtaining a continuum of resistance states. Proton intercalation increases the electronic conductivity of WO(3) by increasing both the carrier density and mobility.

A Canadian-based practice reflective was undertaken to evaluate the current state of understanding of injection technique practices by patients administering insulin, and the importance physicians place on proper injection technique. METHODS: Twenty-four sites across Canada completed a practice profile survey and enrolled adult non-pregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes injecting insulin using an insulin pen. Seven areas of proper injection technique to be evaluated were identified by the study steering committee: size of injection site, use of a skin lift, needle reuse, length of the needle, duration of the needle in the skin, injection into lipohypertrophic tissue, and applied injection force. During a scheduled visit, each patient filled out the Injection Technique Survey and the physician documented the answers via an electronic database. RESULTS: Almost all physicians surveyed agreed (96%) that proper insulin injection technique is important or very important and 80% indicated they were either completely confident or fairly confident in discussing overall insulin injection technique. All patients surveyed were making at least one insulin injection technique error within the following categories: applied injection force (76%), area size of injection site (64%), duration of pen needle in skin (61%), pen needle reuse (39%), performs a skin lift with a 4 or 5 mm needle (38%), uses a longer pen needle than required (34%), and injection of insulin into lipohypertrophic tissue (37%). CONCLUSION: Patients commonly make insulin injection errors. Patient and physician education on optimal insulin injection technique continues to be an unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with diabetes.

RESULTS: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus CA16 was able to survive and grow in minimal medium with diesel as the only source of carbon. We determined through metabolomics that A. calcoaceticus CA16 appears to be efficient at diesel degradation. Specifically, CA16 is able to degrade 82 to 92% of aliphatic alkane hydrocarbons (C(n)H(n + 2); where n = 12–18) in 28 days. Several diesel-degrading genes (such as alkM and xcpR) that are present in other microbes were also found to be activated in CA16.

We used our data to assess progress toward the Federation Dental International, World Health Organization, and International Association for Dental Research’s oral health goals of reducing the level of oral diseases and minimizing their impact by 2020. Oral health has not improved in the last 25 y, and oral conditions remained a major public health challenge all over the world in 2015.

Of all high frequency ventilation techniques, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is the most well studied and is the most commonly utilized in clinical practice today. In HFOV, small volume oscillatory vibrations are superimposed on continuous distending pressure in a manner that allows efficient CO(2) elimination during continuous alveolar recruitment. By preserving end-expiratory lung volume, minimizing cyclic stretch, and avoiding alveolar overdistension at end-inspiration, HFOV is uniquely capable of providing the ultimate “open lung” strategy of ventilation. Over the past decade, a growing evidence base implicating phasic alveolar stretch in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung injury in patients with respiratory failure has driven the iterative refinement of HFOV management protocols for infants, children, and adults. The next step toward applying HFOV in a manner that takes into account the heterogeneity of parenchymal involvement in diseases such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome will require the development of non-invasive bedside technologies capable of identifying regional changes in lung volume and lung mechanics. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising technique that could play a supporting role in the conduct of future clinical trials seeking to identify HFOV strategies that are maximally lung protective.","Ventre, Kathleen M.; Arnold, John H.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,9,5

But the actual responses of states, while exhibiting considerable international cooperation, are predominantly competitive and self-centered. This raises important questions about the utility of our basic intellectual tools—in the form of International Relations Theory (IRT)—for understanding the pattern of these responses. IRT analyzes inter-state dynamics and explains the extent to which states and institutions do or do not cooperate. This critique focuses on theories that stress competition (realism), those that focus on cooperation (liberalism) and those emphasising ideational constructions that could go either way (constructivism and normative theory). It seeks to elucidate the relative strengths of these theories—what they can tell us and what they cannot—in understanding responses to the current pandemic. It concludes that, while all the identified approaches have something to offer, realist theory, which highlights the prioritization of national interests over collective action, provides the most optimal approach for a full understanding of global responses to Covid-19. The analysis helps draw lessons for policy responses to this and other global crises, such as climate change.","Basrur, Rajesh; Kliem, Frederick",SN Soc Sci,9,1

A consequence of such misleading beliefs for sex offenders can be the creation of urban legends and myths that motivated individuals can use to back an agenda and that can bring unintended collateral damage creating false realities for offenders, their families, law enforcement, and the community. This study utilizes Loseke’s lens to examine the socially constructed realities in which sex offenders in the United States are forced to live. The history of the treatment of sex offenders is detailed from colonial America through child sexual abuse panic of the 1980s and into the current cyber age. We review laws passed in the 1990s, through the first part of the new millennium, which fueled individuals’ fear of sex offenders. Additionally, we explore how claims-makers use myths and socially constructed realities to create social problems for sex offenders, generate public fear and resentment, and pressure policy makers and legislatures to pass laws that promise false hope and false security to communities. Finally, myths associated with cyber sexual offenders are explored. Solutions to combat myths are offered to legitimize the true reality surrounding sex offenders.","Burgason, Kyle A.",SN Soc Sci,9,30

METHODS Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal rt-PCR (+) in the emergency department were included in the study. In addition to the CRP, ferritin and D-dimer examinations of patients at admission, thorax CT involvement findings and CT-SS results were recorded. The relationship of CRP value with CT-SS and clinical outcome was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 974 COVID-19 patients, 572 males (58.7%) and 402 females (41.3%), with a mean age of 59.64±17.34 years, were included in the study. The CRP values of the patients who needed intensive care and needed respiratory support were also significantly higher at admission (95.1 mg/dL vs. 31.05 mg/dL) (p<0.001). The CRP values of the patients who developed any complications during the treatment of COVID-19 were higher (79.9 mg/dL vs. 41.85 mg/dL) (p<0.001). In the case of CRP >124.5, a thorax CT density score 7.35 times higher was determined to be severe. In addition, it was determined that there was a 9.09-fold increase in the incidence of negative imaging findings in terms of COVID-19 in cases where the CRP value was <12.5 mg/dL. CONCLUSION The CRP levels of COVID-19 patients measured upon admission to the emergency room are correlated with the severity of lung involvement and are an important predictor of clinical outcomes.","Beydoğan, Engin; Yürük Atasoy, Pınar",International journal of clinical practice,9,1

As part of this national effort, the French Military Medical Service (FMMS) is committed to the fight against COVID-19. This original report aimed to describe and detail actions that the FMMS has carried out in the nationwide fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in France, as well as overseas. Experts in the field reported major actions conducted by the FMMS during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In just few weeks, the FMMS developed ad hoc medical capabilities to support national health authorities. It additionally developed adaptive, collective en route care via aeromedical and naval units and deployed a military intensive care field hospital. A COVID-19 crisis cell coordinated the French Armed Forces health management. The French Military Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health provided all information needed to guide the decision-making process. Medical centres of the French Armed Forces organised the primary care for military patients, with the widespread use of telemedicine. The Paris Fire Brigade and the Marseille Navy Fire Battalion emergency departments ensured prehospital management of patients with COVID-19. The eight French military training hospitals cooperated with civilian regional health agencies. The French military medical supply chain supported all military medical treatment facilities in France as well as overseas, coping with a growing shortage of medical equipment. The French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute performed diagnostics, engaged in multiple research projects, updated the review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 daily and provided expert recommendations on biosafety. Finally, even students of the French military medical academy volunteered to participate in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, in an unprecedented medical crisis, the FMMS engaged multiple innovative and adaptive actions, which are still ongoing, in the fight against COVID-19. The collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems reinforced the shared objective to achieve the goal of 'saving the greatest number'.","Pasquier, Pierre; Luft, A; Gillard, J; Boutonnet, M; Vallet, C; Pontier, J-M; Duron-Martinaud, S; Dia, A; Puyeo, L; Debrus, F; Prunet, B; Beaume, S; de Saint Maurice, G; Meaudre, E; Ficko, C; Merens, A; Raharisson, G; Conte, B; Dorandeu, F; Canini, F; Michel, R; Ausset, S; Escarment, J",BMJ military health,9,1

METHODS The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) was a randomized controlled trial of IV alteplase for ischemic stroke. We assessed CT or brain MRI at baseline (pretreatment) and 24 to 48 hours posttreatment for acute lesion visibility, extent, and swelling, masked to all other data. We analyzed associations between treatment allocation, change in brain tissue appearances between baseline and follow-up imaging, and 6-month functional outcome in IST-3. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials of alteplase vs control with pre- and postrandomization imaging. RESULTS Of 3,035 patients recruited in IST-3, 2,916 had baseline and follow-up brain imaging. Progression in either lesion extent or swelling independently predicted poorer 6-month outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.96, p < 0.001; OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.79, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients allocated alteplase were less likely than controls to develop increased lesion visibility at follow-up (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.89, p < 0.001), but there was no evidence that alteplase reduced progression of lesion extent or swelling. In meta-analysis of 6 trials including IST-3 (n = 4,757), allocation to alteplase was associated with a reduction in ischemic lesion extent on follow-up imaging (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION Alteplase was associated with reduced short-term progression in lesion visibility. In meta-analysis, alteplase reduced lesion extent. These findings may indicate that alteplase improves functional outcome by reducing tissue damage. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that IV alteplase impedes the progression of ischemic brain lesions on imaging after stroke.","Mair, Grant; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Morris, Zoe; von Heijne, Anders; Bradey, Nick; Cala, Lesley; Peeters, André; Farrall, Andrew J; Adami, Alessandro; Potter, Gillian; Sandercock, Peter A G; Lindley, Richard I; Wardlaw, Joanna M",Neurology,9,17

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphagia in elderly patients admitted to a tertiary care center. It also sought to investigate how dysphagia is identified, how it covaries with malnutrition and other conditions, and how it impacts hospital stay. STUDY DESIGN Case Series. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed. All patients >65 years admitted to a tertiary care center in January and February 2016 were included. Patients with primary psychiatric diagnoses and patients with upper aerodigestive tract malignancy or surgery were excluded. RESULTS A total of 655 patients were identified. Mean age was 76.6 years. Twenty-four percent (155 patients) had dysphagia while 43% (282 patients) had malnutrition. Thirteen percent (84 patients) had both dysphagia and malnutrition. Fifty percent of patients who had malnutrition were seen by speech language pathology (SLP). One hundred percent of malnourished patients that saw SLP were identified as having dysphagia. Three hundred and eighty-two patients (58%) were seen by the dietician but not by SLP. Multiple logistic regression indicated that the presence of dysphagia was positively associated with age, presence of malnutrition, admission to either cardiology or neurology service as compared to medicine service, and history of stroke. CONCLUSIONS One-quarter of elderly patients admitted to our tertiary care center had dysphagia. Dysphagia, especially when linked with malnutrition, has poorer outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Our data suggests a possible disconnect between malnutrition diagnosis and dysphagia identification. This is an important area of intervention that has the potential to improve the treatment and outcomes of these patients.

Obesity, insulin resistance, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress have been identified amongst the possible hits leading to the onset and progression of this disease. Nutritional evaluation of NAFLD patients showed a lower-than-recommended intake of vitamin E. Vitamin E is a family of 8 isoforms, 4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols. Alpha-tocopherol has been widely investigated in liver diseases, whereas no previous clinical trial has investigated tocotrienols for NAFLD. Aim of the study was to determine the effects of mixed tocotrienols, in normalising the hepatic echogenic response in hypercholesterolaemic patients with ultrasound-proven NAFLD. METHODS Eighty-seven untreated hypercholesterolaemic adults with ultrasound-proven NAFLD were enrolled and randomised into control group (n = 44) and tocotrienols group (n = 43). The treatment, either mixed tocotrienols 200 mg twice daily or placebo, had a 1-year duration.Normalisation of hepatic echogenic response, being the trial primary aim, was used in sample size calculations. The data were assessed according to intention to treat principle as primary outcome. Per protocol analysis was also carried out as secondary outcome measurement. RESULTS Thirty and 34 participants concluded the study in the tocotrienols and placebo group respectively. Alpha-tocopherol levels were within the normal range for all subjects. As primary outcome, the normalisation of hepatic echogenic response was significantly higher for the tocotrienols treated group compared to the placebo group in the intention to treat analysis (P = 0.039; 95% CI = 0.896-6.488). As secondary objective, the per protocol assessment also showed significant rate of remission (P = 0.014; 95% CI = 1.117-9.456). Worsening of NAFLD grade was recorded in two patients in the placebo group, but none in the group treated with tocotrienols. No adverse events were reported for both groups. CONCLUSION This is the first clinical trial that showed the hepatoprotective effects of mixed palm tocotrienols in hypercholesterolemic adults with NAFLD.","Magosso, Enrico; Ansari, Mukhtar Alam; Gopalan, Yogheswaran; Shuaib, Ibrahim Lutfi; Wong, Jia-Woei; Khan, Nurzalina Abdul Karim; Abu Bakar, Mohamed Rizal; Ng, Bee-Hong; Yuen, Kah-Hay",Nutrition journal,9,17

Recent stemness evaluation methods based on the absolute expression have been proposed to reveal the relationship between stemness and cancer. However, we found that existing methods do not perform well in assessing the stemness of KIRC patients, and they overlooked the impact of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing not only progresses during the differentiation of stem cells, but also changes during the acquisition of the stemness features of cancer stem cells. There is an urgent need for a new method to predict KIRC-specific stemness more accurately, so as to provide help in selecting treatment options. METHODS The corresponding RNA-Seq data were obtained from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. We also downloaded stem cell RNA sequence data from the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) Synapse Portal. Independent validation sets with large sample size and common clinic pathological characteristics were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. we constructed a KIRC-specific stemness prediction model using an algorithm called one-class logistic regression based on the expression and alternative splicing data to predict stemness indices of KIRC patients, and the model was externally validated. We identify stemness-associated alternative splicing events (SASEs) by analyzing different alternative splicing event between high- and low- stemness groups. Univariate Cox and multivariable logistic regression analysisw as carried out to detect the prognosis-related SASEs respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive values of our model. RESULTS Here, we constructed a KIRC-specific stemness prediction model with an AUC of 0.968,and to provide a user-friendly interface of our model for KIRC stemness analysis, we have developed KIRC Stemness Calculator and Visualization (KSCV), hosted on the Shiny server, can most easily be accessed via web browser and the url https://jiang-lab.shinyapps.io/kscv/ . When applied to 605 KIRC patients, our stemness indices had a higher correlation with the gender, smoking history and metastasis of the patients than the previous stemness indices, and revealed intratumor heterogeneity at the stemness level. We identified 77 novel SASEs by dividing patients into high- and low- stemness groups with significantly different outcome and they had significant correlations with expression of 17 experimentally validated splicing factors. Both univariate and multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that SASEs closely correlated with the overall survival of patients. CONCLUSIONS Basing on the stemness indices, we found that not only immune infiltration but also alternative splicing events showed significant different at the stemness level. More importantly, we highlight the critical role of these differential alternative splicing events in poor prognosis, and we believe in the potential for their further translation into targets for immunotherapy.","Xiao, Lixing; Zou, Guoying; Cheng, Rui; Wang, Pingping; Ma, Kexin; Cao, Huimin; Zhou, Wenyang; Jin, Xiyun; Xu, Zhaochun; Huang, Yan; Lin, Xiaoyu; Nie, Huan; Jiang, Qinghua",BMC cancer,9,29

METHODS Panelists reviewed results from a search of PubMed and state and federal government sources to assess frequency, demographics, and risk factors for opioid-related overdose deaths over the past decade. They also reviewed results from a Utah Department of Health study and a summary of malpractice lawsuits involving opioid-related deaths. RESULTS National data demonstrate a pattern of increasing opioid-related overdose deaths beginning in the early 2000s. A high proportion of methadone-related deaths was noted. Although methadone represented less than 5% of opioid prescriptions dispensed, one third of opioid-related deaths nationwide implicated methadone. Root causes identified by the panel were physician error due to knowledge deficits, patient non-adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, unanticipated medical and mental health comorbidities, including substance use disorders, and payer policies that mandate methadone as first-line therapy. Other likely contributors to all opioid-related deaths were the presence of additional central nervous system-depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants) and sleep-disordered breathing. CONCLUSIONS Causes of opioid-related deaths are multifactorial, so solutions must address prescriber behaviors, patient contributory factors, nonmedical use patterns, and systemic failures. Clinical strategies to reduce opioid-related mortality should be empirically tested, should not reduce access to needed therapies, should address risk from methadone as well as other opioids, and should be incorporated into any risk evaluation and mitigation strategies enacted by regulators.","Webster, Lynn R; Cochella, Susan; Dasgupta, Nabarun; Fakata, Keri L; Fine, Perry G; Fishman, Scott M; Grey, Todd; Johnson, Erin M; Lee, Lewis K; Passik, Steven D; Peppin, John; Porucznik, Christina A; Ray, Albert; Schnoll, Sidney H; Stieg, Richard L; Wakeland, Wayne",Pain medicine,9,1

For that reason, the exact composition of DNA sequences underlying the heterochromatic regions and the active centromeres are still unexplored for many organisms. The centromere is a crucial region of eukaryotic chromosomes responsible for the accurate segregation of genetic material. The typical landmark of centromere chromatin is the rapidly-evolving variant of the histone H3, CenH3, while DNA sequences packed in constitutive heterochromatin are associated with H3K9me3-modified histones. In the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas we identified its centromere histone variant, Cg-CenH3, that shows stage-specific distribution in gonadal cells. In order to investigate the DNA composition of genomic regions associated with the two specific chromatin types, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing of the Cg-CenH3- and H3K9me3-associated sequences. CenH3-associated sequences were assigned to six groups of repetitive elements, while H3K9me3-associated-ones were assigned only to three. Those associated with CenH3 indicate the lack of uniformity in the chromosomal distribution of sequences building the centromeres, being also in the same time dispersed throughout the genome. The heterochromatin of C. gigas exhibited general paucity and limited chromosomal localization as predicted, with H3K9me3-associated sequences being predominantly constituted of DNA transposons.","Tunjić Cvitanić, Monika; Vojvoda Zeljko, Tanja; Pasantes, Juan J; García-Souto, Daniel; Gržan, Tena; Despot-Slade, Evelin; Plohl, Miroslav; Šatović, Eva",Genes,9,20

Aims To examine the effects of medication, placebo and supportive care on treatment outcome, and the relationships of expectations and therapeutic alliance to improvement. METHOD A total of 88 participants were randomised to 8 weeks of treatment with supportive care alone or combined with double-blind treatment with placebo or antidepressant medication. Expectations of medication effectiveness, general treatment effectiveness and therapeutic alliance were measured (trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00200902). RESULTS Medication or placebo plus supportive care were not significantly different but had significantly better outcome than supportive care alone. Therapeutic alliance predicted response to medication and placebo; expectations of medication effectiveness at enrolment predicted only placebo response. CONCLUSIONS Pill treatment yielded better outcome than supportive care alone. Medication expectations uniquely predicted placebo treatment outcome and were formed by time of enrolment, suggesting that they were shaped by prior experiences outside the clinical trial.","Leuchter, Andrew F; Hunter, Aimee M; Tartter, Molly; Cook, Ian A",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,9,1

An extract of Acacia schweinfurthii was screened for potential serine proteinase inhibition. It was successfully purified to homogeneity by precipitating with 80% (v/v) acetone and sequential chromatographic steps, including ion-exchange, affinity purification and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions revealed an inhibitor (ASTI) consisting of two polypeptide chains A and B of approximate molecular weights of 16 and 10 kDa, respectively, and under non-reducing conditions, 26 kDa was observed. The inhibitor was shown to inhibit bovine trypsin (Ki of 3.45 nM) at an approximate molar ratio of inhibitor:trypsin (1:1). The A- and B-chains revealed complete sequences of 140 and 40 amino acid residues, respectively. Sequence similarity (70%) was reported between ASTI A-chain and ACTI A-chain (Acacia confusa) using ClustalW. The B-chain produced a 76% sequence similarity between ASTI and Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor.","Odei-Addo, Frank; Frost, Carminita; Smith, Nanette; Ogawa, Tomohisa; Muramoto, Koji; Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela; Gráf, László; Naude, Ryno",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,9,7

METHODS A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed using 20 client-owned dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion requiring hemilaminectomy. Dogs were randomly assigned to HOB or TRAD. Neurologic function and pain scores were assessed pre-operatively. Intraoperative blood loss and surgical approach time as well as postoperative pain and wound healing scores were recorded. Additionally, neurologic recovery and owner perceived quality of life were recorded at day 10 and 30 postoperative. RESULTS There was no significant difference in sex distribution, weight, age, preoperative neurological grade and pain score, and perioperative outcome measures between groups. Intraoperative total blood loss was minimal for HOB and TRAD (median: 0 ml (range 0-9) and 2.2 ml (range 0-6.8), respectively; p = 0.165) and approach times were similar (median: 7 min (range 5-12) and 8 min (range 5-13), respectively; p = 0.315). While changes in wound healing scores were similar, changes in postoperative pain scores and neurological function were significantly improved in the HOB compared to the TRAD group. Postoperative complications in the HOB group consisted of automutilation of part of the incision and development of a small soft, non-painful subcutaneous swelling in 1 dog each. CONCLUSIONS The HOB is a safe and effective tool for the soft tissue approach for routine spinal surgery in dogs and is associated with decreased pain and increased neurological function post-surgery.","Hettlich, Bianca F; Cook, Laurie; London, Cheryl; Fosgate, Geoffrey T",PloS one,9,27

Although they may cause considerable morbidity, they are preventable. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the electrical properties of a tissue close to and away from the pressure sore site, and (2) establish a new approach for objective, reliable, low-cost and noninvasive screening or detection of pressure sore in its early stage. STUDY DESIGN Randomised controlled trial. METHODS Fifteen patients participated in this study. They all had stage I or stage II sacral pressure sores. Tiny surface electrodes in four-electrode configuration were used for all tissue electrical properties measurements recorded over the frequency range of 30-10 MHz. RESULTS Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed that all measurements (ICC > 0.90 for all measurements) had good reliability and validity. The real part of impedance (R) and the imaginary part of impedance (X) of a tissue measured close to the pressure sore site was found to be significantly smaller (p < 0.05 in all cases) than that measured away from the pressure sore site at a specific frequency range (R: 30.00-38.55 Hz; X: 43.95-606.40 Hz). It was also found that the extracellular resistance (R(e)) and the ratio of extracellular resistance to intracellular resistance (R(e)/R(i)) of a tissue measured close to the pressure sore site were significantly smaller (p < 0.05 in all cases) than that measured away from the pressure sore site. CONCLUSIONS Since the electrical properties (R, X, R(e), R(e)/R(i) ) of a tissue close to, and away from, the pressure sore site can be significantly distinguished, a potentially promising method for the screening of pressure sores at an early stage has been proposed.","Ching, Congo Tak-Shing; Chou, Mei-Yun; Jiang, Siou-Jhen; Huang, Su-Hua; Sun, Tai-Ping; Liu, Wei-Hao; Liu, Chia-Ming",Prosthetics and orthotics international,9,5

V(m)-dependent shifts of excitation and emission spectra establish two excitation bands (<481 and >481 nm) that produce fluorescence changes of opposite polarity within a single emission band (575-620 nm). The ratio of these positive and negative fluorescence signals (excitation ratiometry) increases V(m) sensitivity and removes artifacts common to both signals. We pulsed blue (450 ± 10 nm) and cyan (505 ± 15 nm) light emitting diodes (LEDs) at 375 Hz in alternating phase synchronized to a camera (750 frames-per-second). Fluorescence was bandpass filtered (585 ± 20 nm). This produced signals with upright (blue) and inverted (cyan) action potentials (APs) interleaved in sequential frames. In four whole swine hearts with motion chemically arrested, fractional fluorescence for blue, cyan, and ratio signals was 1.2 ± 0.3%, 1.2 ± 0.3%, and 2.4 ± 0.6%, respectively. Signal-to-noise ratios were 4.3 ± 1.4, 4.0 ± 1.2, and 5.8 ± 1.9, respectively. After washing out the electromechanical uncoupling agent, we characterized motion artifact by cross-correlating blue, cyan, and ratio signals with a signal with normal AP morphology. Ratiometry improved cross-correlation coefficients from 0.50 ± 0.48 to 0.81 ± 0.25, but did not cancel all motion artifacts. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of pulsed LED excitation ratiometry in myocardium.","Bachtel, Andrew D; Gray, Richard A; Stohlman, Jayna M; Bourgeois, Elliot B; Pollard, Andrew E; Rogers, Jack M",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,9,7

Exercise has been shown to improve health generally, but it is uncertain whether exercise may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity, and duration of ARIs. This is an update of our review published in 2015. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity, or duration of acute respiratory infections. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to March week 1, 2020), Embase (1974 to 05 March 2020), CINAHL (1981 to 05 March 2020), LILACS (1982 to 05 March 2020), SPORTDiscus (1985 to 05 March 2020), PEDro (searched 05 March 2020), OTseeker (searched 05 March 2020), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 05 March 2020). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (method of allocation that is not truly random, e.g. based on date of birth, medical record number) of exercise for ARIs in the general population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using a standard form. One review author entered data, which a second review author checked. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. There were sufficient differences in the populations trialed and in the nature of the interventions to use the random-effects model (which makes fewer assumptions than the fixed-effect model) in the analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included three new trials for this update (473 participants) for a total of 14 trials involving 1377 adults, published between 1990 and 2018. Nine trials were conducted in the USA, and one each in Brazil, Canada, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 419 participants, aged from 18 to 85 years. The proportion of female participants ranged from 52% to 100%. Follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 36 weeks (median = 12 weeks). Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (walking, bicycling, treadmill, or a combination) was evaluated in 11 trials, and was most commonly prescribed at least three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes. There was no difference between exercise and no exercise in the number of ARI episodes per person per year (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.30; 4 trials; 514 participants; low-certainty evidence); proportion of participants who experienced at least one ARI over the study period (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08; 5 trials; 520 participants; low-certainty evidence); and the number of symptom days per episode of illness (mean difference (MD) -0.44 day, 95% CI -2.33 to 1.46; 6 trials; 557 participants; low-certainty evidence). Exercise reduced the severity of ARI symptoms measured on the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) (MD -103.57, 95% CI -198.28 to -8.87; 2 trials; 373 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and the number of symptom days during follow-up period (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.50 to -0.98; 4 trials; 483 participants; low-certainty evidence). Excercise did not have a significant effect on laboratory parameters (blood lymphocytes, salivary secretory immunoglobulin, and neutrophils), quality of life outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and exercise-related injuries. There was no difference in participant dropout between the intervention and control groups. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded mainly due to limitations in study design and implementation, imprecision, and inconsistency. Seven trials were funded by public agencies; five trials did not report funding; and two trials were funded by private companies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Exercise did not reduce the number of ARI episodes, proportion of participants experiencing at least one ARI during the study, or the number of symptom days per episode of illness. However, exercise reduced the severity of ARI symptoms (two studies) and the number of symptom days during the study follow-up period (four studies). Small study size, risk of bias, and heterogeneity in the populations studied contributed to the uncertainty of the findings. Larger trials that are designed to avoid risk of bias associated with participant selection, blinding of outcomes assessors, and with adequate reporting of all outcomes proposed for measurement in trials, would help to provide more robust evidence.","Grande, Antonio Jose; Keogh, Justin; Silva, Valter; Scott, Anna M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,9,1

It should account for heterogeneity and plasticity of aging. It should also accurately predict aging-related adverse outcomes. Epigenetic age models are based on DNA methylation levels of selected genomic sites. Some of the epigenetic age models are significant predictors of mortality and healthy/unhealthy aging. However, biological function of DNA methylation at the selected sites is yet to be determined. Frailty is viewed as a syndrome resulting from declined physiological reserve and resilience. The frailty index is a probability-based extension of the frailty concept. Simply being the proportion of health deficits, the frailty index quantifies the progression of unhealthy aging. The frailty index is the best predictor of mortality. It is associated with various biological factors, providing insight into biological processes of aging. Investigation of multiomics factors associated with the frailty index will provide further insight.","Ji, Lixin; Jazwinski, S Michal; Kim, Sangkyu",Annals of geriatric medicine and research,9,11

Many viruses are implicated in these infections, and these viruses are spread largely via respiratory means between humans but also occasionally from animals to humans. This article is an American Society for Microbiology (ASM)-sponsored Practical Guidance for Clinical Microbiology (PGCM) document identifying best practices for diagnosis and characterization of viruses that cause acute respiratory infections and replaces the most recent prior version of the ASM-sponsored Cumitech 21 document, Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Respiratory Disease, published in 1986. The scope of the original document was quite broad, with an emphasis on clinical diagnosis of a wide variety of infectious agents and laboratory focus on antigen detection and viral culture. The new PGCM document is designed to be used by laboratorians in a wide variety of diagnostic and public health microbiology/virology laboratory settings worldwide. The article provides guidance to a rapidly changing field of diagnostics and outlines the epidemiology and clinical impact of acute respiratory viral infections, including preferred methods of specimen collection and current methods for diagnosis and characterization of viral pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections. Compared to the case in 1986, molecular techniques are now the preferred diagnostic approaches for the detection of acute respiratory viruses, and they allow for automation, high-throughput workflows, and near-patient testing. These changes require quality assurance programs to prevent laboratory contamination as well as strong preanalytical screening approaches to utilize laboratory resources appropriately. Appropriate guidance from laboratorians to stakeholders will allow for appropriate specimen collection, as well as correct test ordering that will quickly identify highly transmissible emerging pathogens.","Charlton, Carmen L; Babady, Esther; Ginocchio, Christine C; Hatchette, Todd F; Jerris, Robert C; Li, Yan; Loeffelholz, Mike; McCarter, Yvette S; Miller, Melissa B; Novak-Weekley, Susan; Schuetz, Audrey N; Tang, Yi-Wei; Widen, Ray; Drews, Steven J",Clinical microbiology reviews,9,30

Twenty-five male college football players (age: 19.80 ± 1.08 years) from the first division of national university championship voluntarily participated in the study. The participants completed both a repeated sprint ability test (RSA) and a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIR1) in a randomized order and separated by 7 days. Electrocardiographic signals (ECG) were recorded in a supine position 10 min before and 30 min after the exercise protocols. The HR and HRV data were analyzed in the time segments of baseline 5~10 min (Baseline), post-exercise 0~5 min (Post 1), post-exercise 5~10 min (Post 2), and post-exercise 25~30 min (Post 3). The natural logarithm of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (LnSDNN), root mean square of successive normal-to-normal interval differences (LnRMSSD), and LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio was compared in the 1st min HRVUST and 5-min criterion (HRVcriterion) of each time segment. The correlation of time-domain HRV variables to 5-min natural logarithm of low frequency power (LnLF) and high frequency power (LnHF), and LF:HF ratio were calculated. The results showed that the HRVUST of LnSDNN, LnRMSSD, and LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio showed trivial to small effect sizes (ES) (-0.00~0.49), very large and nearly perfect interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (0.74~0.95), and relatively small values of bias (RSA: 0.01~-0.12; YYIR1: -0.01~-0.16) to the HRVcriterion in both exercise protocols. In addition, the HRVUST of LnLF, LnHF, and LnLF:LnHF showed trivial to small ES (-0.04~-0.54), small to large ICC (-0.02~0.68), and relatively small values of bias (RSA: -0.02~0.65; YYIR1: 0.03~-0.23) to the HRVcriterion in both exercise protocols. Lastly, the 1-min LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio was significantly correlated to the 5-min LnLF:LnHF ratio with moderate~high level (r = 0.43~0.72; p < 0.05) during 30-min post-exercise recovery. The post-exercise 1-min HRV assessment in LnSDNN, LnRMSSD, and LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio was acceptable and accurate in the RSA and YYIR1 tests, compared to the 5-min time segment of measurement. The moderate to high correlation coefficient of the HRVUST LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio to the HRVcriterion LnLF:LnHF ratio indicated the capacity to facilitate the post-exercise shortening duration of HRV measurement after maximal anaerobic or aerobic shuttle running. Using ultra-short-term record of LnSDNN:LnRMSSD ratio as a surrogate for standard measure of LnLF:LnHF ratio after short-term bouts of maximal intensity field-based shuttle running is warranted.","Hung, Chin-Hwai; Clemente, Filipe Manuel; Bezerra, Pedro; Chiu, Yi-Wen; Chien, Chia-Hua; Crowley-McHattan, Zachary; Chen, Yung-Sheng",International journal of environmental research and public health,9,31
95530,95530,95530,Mental health interventions implemented in the COVID-19 pandemic: what is the evidence?,19.247053,0.5572196,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that using a flexible endoscope as a working scope in laparoscopic surgery through a single incision might provide many benefits. To this end, a short-type flexible endoscope with a working length of 600 mm was newly developed. In this animal experimental study, we aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of our new approach, single-incision multiport laparoendoscopic (SIMPLE) cholecystectomy, using this endoscope. METHODS Eight pigs were subjected to SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the short-type flexible endoscope. The endoscope was inserted through a 12-mm trocar in an SILS Port followed by the insertion of two additional 5-mm trocars in the SILS Port. Encirculation and ligation of the pedicle of the cystic artery and duct were carried out using laparoscopic instruments through the 5-mm trocars, while the dissection of the gallbladder from the intrahepatic fossa was predominantly performed using a cutting device through the endoscope. RESULTS A complete gallbladder excision, with complete encirculation and ligation of the pedicle, was completed in all cases. The mean operating time was 58 min (range 34-78 min). The endoscope provided a good view of the operating field, and it allowed some degree of freedom to the working laparoscopic instruments without compromising the field of view. Dissection of the gallbladder using the cutting device through the endoscope was much easier than that using the laparoscopic device, because the articulating instruments together with the endoscope enabled operation with triangulation. Furthermore, the water-jet and suctioning functions and the self-cleaning lens capability of the endoscope served the surgery well. CONCLUSIONS SIMPLE cholecystectomy using the newly developed short-type flexible endoscope is a technically feasible procedure. Using this flexible endoscope for various tasks, such as resection, suctioning, and smoke evacuation, can make the surgical procedures easier.","Abe, Nobutsugu; Takeuchi, Hirohisa; Ohki, Atsuko; Aoki, Hisae; Masaki, Tadahiko; Mori, Toshiyuki; Sugiyama, Masanori",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,9,31

Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.","Geers, Daryl; Shamier, Marc C; Bogers, Susanne; den Hartog, Gerco; Gommers, Lennert; Nieuwkoop, Nella N; Schmitz, Katharina S; Rijsbergen, Laurine C; van Osch, Jolieke A T; Dijkhuizen, Emma; Smits, Gaby; Comvalius, Anouskha; van Mourik, Djenolan; Caniels, Tom G; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Molenkamp, Richard; de Jager, Herbert J; Haagmans, Bart L; de Swart, Rik L; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Binnendijk, Robert S; de Vries, Rory D; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine H",Science immunology,9,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups. Two groups served as control and received orally either vehicle or TPPU (3 mg/kg) for five weeks. The other three groups were given L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for five weeks. Two weeks after the L-NAME treatment, animals received orally either saline or TPPU (3 mg/kg/day) or lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) daily for 3 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, plasma Ang II, cardiac ACE and AT1R protein and gene expressions were determined. RESULTS L-NAME caused a significant increase in BP of the animals. TPPU and lisinopril resulted in normalization of L-NAME-induced hypertension. They also caused a significant reduction in Ang II and ACE protein and gene expressions compared to L-NAME and vehicle-treated animals.

Methods Iron rod microdevices were constructed via template-guided synthesis and suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were added to the samples and imaged with low-field MRI. Results MRI of microdevices and viruses showed decreased signal intensity at low concentrations of viruses that recovered at higher concentrations. Electron micrographs suggest that reduced MRI intensity may be due to concentration-dependent shielding of water protons from local magnetic inhomogeneities caused by the iron microdevices. Conclusions The preliminary results presented in this letter provide justification for further studies exploring the potential diagnostic role of magnetic microdevices in assessing the presence and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.,"Mair, Lamar O; Hale, Olivia; Jafari, Sahar; Chen, Cheng; Udalov, Oleg; Probst, Roland; Baum, Ittai; Hevaganinge, Anjana; Yi Wang, Elaine; Rodriguez, Olga C; Albanese, Christopher; Fricke, Stanley T; Weinberg, Irving N",IEEE open journal of engineering in medicine and biology,9,14

We offer a brief review of governmental policy responses in four OECD countries and how they may impact the disconnect YYA within those countries. METHODS Literature was reviewed utilizing Cochrane Library, ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science to outline existing inequities among disconnected YYA and COVID-19 economic and health impacts. Government responses to COVID-19 from four OECD countries were reviewed. Using the social protection model, we highlighted significant policy changes and developments that influence the protection of vulnerable populations and evaluated the potential effect of long-term economic dislocations prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Disconnected YYA suffered significant financial and health burdens with no social protection floor in place. Lessons learned prior to and during the pandemic indicate that initiatives aimed at improving health and well-being among vulnerable YYA and their communities must be adequately funded, flexible, and comprehensive. Attempts to connect or reconnect YYA who were disconnected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will require a re-envisioning of policy. CONCLUSIONS Globally, governments must invest in social safety net programs that focus on supporting those most at-risk. A concentrated focus on job creation, education and training, and paid work experience, investments in early childhood care and education, housing, health and mental health care is necessary to not only offset the pandemic's effects but also support thriving in the future for YYA.","Palmer, Ashley N; Small, Eusebius",Scandinavian journal of public health,9,31

METHODS Between May 2015 and December 2015, 10 patients with unremitting symptoms or rupture secondary to an acute aortic syndrome involving zone 2 underwent urgent or emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Among them, 8 were treated using homemade proximal scalloped stent grafts to preserve the patency of the left subclavian artery. Indications included traumatic transection (n = 3) and acute (n = 4) and subacute (n = 1) complicated type B aortic dissection. Follow-up computed tomography scans were performed at 1 week and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS The median duration for stent graft modification was 15 minutes (range, 14-17 minutes). The technical success rate was 100%; sealing was achieved in all cases with no type I endoleaks. All left subclavian arteries were patent, although 1 case was associated with a 50% stenosis. No deaths occurred as a consequence of the aortic repair, but 1 patient died of a traumatic renal hematoma on postoperative day 5. During a mean follow-up of 7.2 ± 2 months, there were no conversions to open surgical repair, aortic ruptures, paraplegia, retrograde dissection, or other aortic complications. CONCLUSIONS The use of the homemade proximal scalloped stent graft is both feasible and effective for left subclavian artery revascularization during thoracic endovascular aortic repair involving a spectrum of acute thoracic aortic pathology. This approach provides a rapid, reproducible method of scalloping the endograft. Durability concerns will need to be assessed in additional studies with long-term follow-up.","Canaud, Ludovic; Gandet, Thomas; Khantalin, Ilya; Ozdemir, Baris Ata; Marty-Ané, Charles-Henri; Alric, Pierre",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,9,5

METHODS In this single-center and retrospective study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS Of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 12 remained hospitalized at the end of the study and 167 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 153 (91.6%) were discharged and 14 (8.38%) died in hospital. Approximately half (50.9%) of patients suffered from a comorbidity, with diabetes or coronary heart disease being the most common in 20 patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, dyspnea, and cough. The mean durations from first symptoms to hospital admission was 8.64 ± 4.14 days, whereas the mean hospitalization time to discharge or death was 5.19 ± 2.42 and 4.35 ± 2.70 days, respectively. There was a significantly higher age in non-survivor patients compared with survivor patients. Multivariate regression showed increasing odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital death associated with respiratory rates >20 breaths/min (OR: 5.14, 95% CI: 1.19-22.15, p = 0.028) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >19 mg/dL (OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.30-15.85, p = 0.017) on admission.

RECENT FINDINGS Gastric acid facilitates the digestion of protein as well as the absorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and certain medications. High gastric acidity, in combination with pepsin and lipase, kills ingested microorganisms and may play a role in preventing bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Stimulants of acid secretion include histamine, gastrin, acetylcholine, and ghrelin. Inhibitors include somatostatin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and adrenomedullin. Helicobacter pylori stimulates or inhibits depending upon the time course of infection and the area of the stomach predominantly infected. Proteins implicated in H-K-ATPase membrane trafficking include myosin IIB, F-actin, ezrin, and Rab GTPases. SUMMARY Our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion continues to advance.

Recent ET trials have moved towards selecting patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery occlusions, which will likely leave a gap in our understanding of the treatment outcomes of M2 occlusions. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS To examine the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of M2 compared with M1 MCA occlusions in patients undergoing ET by assessing comprehensive MRI, angiography, and clinical data. RESULTS We found that M2 occlusions can lead to massive strokes defined by hypoperfused and infarcted volumes as well as death or moderate to severe disability in nearly 50% of patients at discharge. Compared with M1 occlusions, M2 occlusions achieved similar Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3 recanalization rates, with significantly less hemorrhage. M2 occlusions presented with smaller infarct and hypoperfused volumes and had smaller final infarct volumes regardless of recanalization. TICI 2b/3 recanalization of M2 occlusions was associated with smaller infarct volumes compared with TICI 0-2a recanalization, as well as less infarct expansion, in patients who received IV tissue plasminogen activator as well as those that did not. Successful reperfusion of M2 occlusions was associated with improved discharge modified Rankin scale. CONCLUSIONS If suitable as targets of ET, M2 occlusions should be given the same consideration as M1 occlusions.","Sheth, Sunil A; Yoo, Bryan; Saver, Jeffrey L; Starkman, Sidney; Ali, Latisha K; Kim, Doojin; Gonzalez, Nestor R; Jahan, Reza; Tateshima, Satoshi; Duckwiler, Gary; Vinuela, Fernando; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,9,12

The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation. Our findings plead against a bystander role of the polymorphisms as a marker for historical migrations, which comigrate with causal genes involved in COVID-19 infection. Further studies are required to assess the clinical outcome of COVID-19 in C3S and ACE1 D allele carriers and to study the role of C3 and ACE1 D/I polymorphisms in COVID-19 and their potential effects on treatment response.","Delanghe, Joris R; De Buyzere, Marc L; Speeckaert, Marijn M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,9,30

In this study we investigated the role of S1PR2 internalization in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Clinical data of randomly selected 60 CRC specimens showed the correlation between S1PR2 internalization and increased intracellular uracil (P < 0.001). Then we explored the regulatory mechanisms in CRC model of villin-S1PR2-/- mice and CRC cell lines. We showed that co-administration of S1P promoted S1PR2 internalization from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus blunted 5-FU efficacy against colorectal tumors in WT mice, compared to that in S1PR2-/- mice. In HCT116 and HT-29 cells, application of S1P (10 μM) empowered S1PR2 to internalize from PM to ER, thus inducing 5-FU resistance, whereas the specific S1PR2 inhibitor JTE-013 (10 μM) effectively inhibited S1P-induced S1PR2 internalization. Using Mag-Fluo-AM-labeling [Ca2+]ER and LC-ESI-MS/MS, we revealed that internalized S1PR2 triggered elevating [Ca2+]ER levels to activate PERK-eLF2α-ATF4 signaling in HCT116 cells. The activated ATF4 upregulated RNASET2-mediated uracil generation, which impaired exogenous 5-FU uptake to blunt 5-FU therapy. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism of 5-FU resistance resulted from S1PR2 internalization-upregulated uracil generation in colorectal cancer, and provides the novel insight into the significance of S1PR2 localization in predicting the benefit of CRC patients from 5-FU-based chemotherapy.","Zhang, Yu-Hang; Cui, Shu-Xiang; Wan, Sheng-Biao; Wu, Shu-Hua; Qu, Xian-Jun",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,9,16

Few studies have attempted to understand or model the different approaches to leadership which are used when promoting the uptake and implementation of evidence-based interventions. This research aims to uncover and explain how distributed clinical leadership can be developed and improved to enhance the use of evidence in practice. In doing so, this study examines implementation leadership in orthopaedic surgery to explain leadership as a collective endeavour which cannot be separated from the organisational context. METHODS A mixed-method study consisting of longitudinal and cross-sectional interviews and an embedded social network analysis will be performed in six NHS hospitals. A social network analysis will be undertaken in each hospital to uncover the organisational networks, the focal leadership actors and information flows in each organisation. This will be followed by a series of repeated semi-structured interviews, conducted over 4 years, with orthopaedic surgeons and their professional networks. These longitudinal interviews will be supplemented by cross-sectional interviews with the national established surgical leaders. All qualitative data will be analysed using a constructivist grounded theory approach and integrated with the quantitative data. The participant narratives will enrich the social network to uncover the leadership configurations which exist, and how different configurations of leadership are functioning in practice to influence implementation processes and outcomes. DISCUSSION The study findings will facilitate understanding about how and why different configurations of leadership develop and under what organisational conditions and circumstances they are able to flourish. The study will guide the development of leadership interventions that are grounded in the data and aimed at advancing leadership for service improvement in orthopaedics. The strength of the study lies in the combination of multi-component, multi-site, multi-agent methods to examine leadership processes in surgery. The findings may be limited by the practical challenges of longitudinal qualitative data collection, such as ensuring participant retention, which need to be balanced against the theoretical and empirical insights generated through this comprehensive exploration of leadership across and within a range of healthcare organisations.","Grove, Amy; Clarke, Aileen; Currie, Graeme; Metcalfe, Andy; Pope, Catherine; Seers, Kate",Implementation science : IS,9,1

The BM microenvironment is inherently complex and extensive studies have been devoted to identifying the niche that maintains HSPC homeostasis and supports hematopoietic potential. The Notch signaling pathway is required for the emergence of the definitive Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) during embryonic development, but its role in BM HSC homeostasis is convoluted. Recent work has begun to explore novel roles for the Notch signaling pathway in downstream progenitor populations. In this review, we will focus an important role for Notch signaling in the establishment of a T cell primed sub-population of Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLPs). Given that its activation mechanism relies primarily on cell-to-cell contact, Notch signaling is an ideal means to investigate and define a novel BM lymphopoietic niche. We will discuss how new genetic model systems indicate a pre-thymic, BM-specific role for Notch activation in early T cell development and what this means to the paradigm of lymphoid lineage commitment. Lastly, we will examine how leukemic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) blasts take advantage of Notch and downstream lymphoid signals in the pathological BM niche.","Sottoriva, Kilian; Pajcini, Kostandin V",Frontiers in immunology,9,1

Advances in ventilator technology have allowed the introduction of numerous ventilator modes in an effort to improve gas exchange, reduce the risk of VILI, and finally improve outcome. In this review, we will summarize the studies evaluating some of the nonconventional ventilation techniques and discuss their possible use in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS Proportional assist ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilator assist are able to improve patient-ventilator synchrony, possibly sleep, and may be better tolerated than pressure support ventilation; both integrate the physiological concept of respiratory variability like noisy ventilation. Experimental or short-term clinical studies have shown physiological benefits with the application of biphasic pressure modes. Some of the automated weaning algorithms may reduce time spent on ventilator and decrease ICU stay, especially in a busy environment. SUMMARY Apart from the physiological and clinical attractiveness demonstrated in animals and small human studies, most of the nonconventional ventilator modes must prove their clinical benefits in large prospective trials before being applied in daily clinical practice.","Cordioli, Ricardo Luiz; Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Brochard, Laurent",Current opinion in critical care,9,17

Alternatively, immunosuppression might reduce inflammatory complications and/or antiretrovirals could be protective. METHODS Prospective reporting of all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection was required within the HOPE in Action Multicenter Consortium, a cohort of kidney and liver transplant recipients with HIV who have received organs from donors with and without HIV at 32 transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS Between 3/20/2020-9/25/2020, there were 11 COVID-19 cases among 291 kidney and liver recipients with HIV (4%). In those with COVID-19, median age was 59 years, 10 were male, 8 were kidney recipients, and 5 had donors with HIV. A higher proportion of recipients with COVID-19 compared to the overall HOPE in Action cohort were Hispanic (55% vs 12%) and received transplants in New York City (73% vs 34%, p< 0.05). Most (10/11, 91%) were hospitalized. High-level oxygen support was required in 7 and intensive care in 5; 1 participant opted for palliative care instead of transfer to the intensive care unit. HIV RNA was undetectable in all. Median absolute lymphocyte count was 0.3 x 10 cells/μL. Median CD4 pre-COVID-19 was 298 cells/μL, declining to <200 cells/ul in 6/7 with measurements on admission. Treatment included high-dose steroids (n=6), tocilizumab (n=3), remdesivir (n=2), and convalescent plasma (n=2). Four patients (36%) died.

No reviews so far have assessed the methodologic quality of available intervention studies or have bundled the effect sizes of individual studies on exercise-induced effects on BDNF blood levels in human PD. Research design and methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and PubMed from inception to June 2017. Results Data aggregated from two randomized controlled trials and four pre-experimental studies with a total of 100 ambulatory patients with idiopathic PD (Hoehn/Yahr ≤3) found improvements in BDNF blood concentration levels in all 6 studies (two RCTs and 4 pre-experimental studies). Pooled BDNF level change scores from the 2 RCTs resulted in a significant homogeneous summary effect size (Standardized Mean Difference 2.06, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.76), and a significant heterogeneous SES for the motor part of the UPDRS-III examination (MD -5.53, 95% CI -10.42 to -0.64). Clinical improvements were noted in all studies using a variety of outcome measures. Limitations The evidence-base consists primarily of small studies with low to moderate methodological quality. Conclusions This review provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of physical exercise treatments for persons with PD on BDNF blood levels.

The etiological agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), possesses a RNA viral genome with nine open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1a and ORF1b replicase-associated genes encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. The pp1a is processed in nine non-structural proteins (nsps): nsp1α, nsp1β, and nsp2 to nsp8. Proteolytic cleavage of pp1ab generates products nsp9 to nsp12. The proteolytic pp1a cleavage products process and cleave pp1a and pp1ab into nsp products. The nsp9 to nsp12 are involved in virus genome transcription and replication. The 3' end of the viral genome encodes four minor and three major structural proteins. The GP(2a), GP₃ and GP₄ (encoded by ORF2a, 3 and 4), are glycosylated membrane associated minor structural proteins. The fourth minor structural protein, the E protein (encoded by ORF2b), is an unglycosylated membrane associated protein. The viral envelope contains two major structural proteins: a glycosylated major envelope protein GP₅ (encoded by ORF5) and an unglycosylated membrane M protein (encoded by ORF6). The third major structural protein is the nucleocapsid N protein (encoded by ORF7). All PRRSV non-structural and structural proteins are essential for virus replication, and PRRSV infectivity is relatively intolerant to subtle changes within the structural proteins. PRRSV virulence is multigenic and resides in both the non-structural and structural viral proteins. This review discusses the molecular characteristics, biological and immunological functions of the PRRSV structural and nsps and their involvement in the virus pathogenesis.","Music, Nedzad; Gagnon, Carl A",Animal health research reviews,9,1

Here we assessed the suitability of using 100-well BioScreen plates or 96-well plates incubated in a robot hotel to cultivate eight filamentous marine fungi, six sporulating and two non-sporulating, to obtain data on growth and substrate (glucose, xylose, galactose or glycerol) utilisation in a high throughput manner. All eight fungi grew in both cultivation systems, but growth was more variable and with more noise in the data in the Cytomat plate hotel than in the BioScreen. Specific growth rates between 0.01 (no added substrate) and 0.07 h-1 were measured for strains growing in the BioScreen and between 0.01 and 0.27 h-1 for strains in the plate hotel. Three strains, Dendryphiella salina LF304, Penicillium chrysogenum KF657 and Penicillium pinophilum LF458, consistently had higher specific growth rates on glucose and xylose in the plate hotel than in the BioScreen, but otherwise results were similar in the two systems. However, because of the noise in data from the plate hotel, the data obtained from it could only be used to distinguish between substrates which did or did not support growth, whereas data from BioScreen also provided information on substrate preference. Glucose was the preferred substrate for all strains, followed by xylose and galactose. Five strains also grew on glycerol. Therefore it was important to minimise the amount of glycerol introduced with the inoculum to avoid misinterpreting the results for growth on poor substrates. We concluded that both systems could provide physiological data with filamentous fungi, provided sufficient replicates are included in the measurements.","Tamminen, Anu; Happonen, Petrus; Barth, Dorothee; Holmström, Sami; Wiebe, Marilyn G",PloS one,9,23

METHODS Ventilatory mechanics were measured by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) in ALS patients and matched controls. Analysis determined whether OEP measurements correlated with standard clinical measures. RESULTS ALS patients (N = 18) had lower forced vital capacity percent predicted (55.2 ± 22.0 L) compared with controls (N = 15; 104.7 ± 16.2 L) and higher ventilatory inefficiency (49.2 ± 9.0 vs. 40.0 ± 3.5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both measures). Lower tidal volumes within the diaphragm area correlated with the dyspnea subscore calculated from the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (P = 0.031), and paradoxical movement of the ribcage compared with the abdominal compartment was seen in the most severe cases.

Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we aimed to identify potential barriers and facilitators of this implementation. We conducted 38 qualitative interviews with stakeholders in PR from different organizations (Department of Health, Schools, Healthcare Providers, and Community organizations). We evaluated construct rating variability between the organizations to determine barriers and facilitators. The strongest facilitator determined was stakeholder's awareness of the parent's and student's needs to meet the HPV school-entry requirement. Other facilitators included initiatives for school-entry policies and the relative advantage of this requirement over different strategies. The strongest barriers included was the cost for private providers to administer the HPV vaccine, the negative influence of social media about the vaccine, which affected parents' acceptance, and the lack of school nurses as available staff resources for the school entry requirement. Findings from this study can be used to improve implementation (adaptations/modifications) and inform other states and countries in earlier stages of consideration of the adoption of similar immunization policies. Most barriers can be modifiable with the implementation of educational programs/training across schools, considering that they are the first line of response to parents of this school entry requirement.","Colón-López, Vivian; Soto-Abreu, Roxana; Medina-Laabes, Diana T; Díaz-Miranda, Olga L; Ortiz, Ana P; Suárez, Erick L; Hull, Pamela C",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,9,16

To better understand mechanisms of vulnerability and identify individuals at risk for psychopathological symptoms in response to stressors is critical for prevention and intervention. The error-related negativity (ERN) has been discussed as a neural risk marker for psychopathology and the present study examined its predictive validity for perceived risk, stress, and psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods One hundred thirteen individuals who had participated as healthy control participants in previous EEG studies (2014-2019) completed a follow-up online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany. Associations of pre-pandemic ERN and correct-response negativity (CRN) with perceived risk regarding COVID-19 infection, stress, and internalizing symptoms during the pandemic were examined using mediation models. Results Pre-pandemic ERN and CRN were associated with increased perceived risk regarding a COVID-19 infection. Via this perceived risk, ERN and CRN were associated with increased stress during the pandemic. Further, risk perception and stress mediated indirect effects of ERN and CRN on internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, while controlling for the effects of pre-pandemic symptom-levels. Conclusions In summary, heightened pre-pandemic performance monitoring showed indirect associations with increases in psychopathological symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave, via effects on perceived COVID-19 risk and stress. These results further strengthen the notion of performance monitoring ERPs as transdiagnostic neural risk markers and highlight the relevance of stress as a catalyst for symptom development.","Riesel, Anja Härpfer Kai Kathmann Norbert Klawohn Julia",Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science,9,1

Fear and concern over vaccine side-effects is one of the main drivers of hesitancy. Drawing from behavioral science and health communication theory, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among 8998 adults to determine whether the way COVID-19 vaccine side-effects are framed and presented to individuals can influence their willingness to take a vaccine. We presented participants information on a hypothetical future COVID-19 vaccine -- including information on its side-effect rate -- and then examined the effect of three side-effect framing strategies on individuals stated willingness to take this vaccine: adding a qualitative risk label next to the numerical risk, adding comparison risks, and for those presented with comparisons, framing the comparison in relative rather than absolute terms. Based on a pre-registered and published analysis plan, we found that adding a simple descriptive risk label (very low risk) next to the numerical side-effect increased participants' willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine by 3.0 percentage points (p = 0.003). Providing a comparison to motor vehicle mortality increased COVID-19 vaccine willingness by 2.4 percentage points (p = 0.051). These effects were independent and additive: participants that received both a qualitative risk label and comparison to motor-vehicle mortality were 6.1 percentage points (p < 0.001) more likely to report willingness to take a vaccine compared to those who did not receive a label or comparison. Taken together, our results reveal that despite increasingly strong vaccination hesitancy and exposure to large amounts of vaccine misinformation, low-cost side-effect framing strategies can meaningfully affect vaccination intentions at a population level.","Sudharsanan, N.; Favaretti, C.; Hachaturyan, V.; Baernighausen, T.; Vandormael, A.",,9,1

Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target for SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","Mick, E.; Tsitsiklis, A.; Spottiswoode, N.; Caldera, S.; Serpa, P.

Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into the health assessment of an animal’s condition.","Jones, Eleanor J.; Poole, Katarina; Sollini, Joseph; Town, Stephen M.; Bizley, Jennifer K.",bioRxiv,9,5

In this study, we aim to investigate the evidence regarding the prevalence of cardiac complications and the resulting mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: Search was conducted in electronic databases of Medline (using PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, in addition to the manual search in preprint databases, and Google and Google scholar search engines, for articles published from 2019 until April 30(th), 2020. Inclusion criterion was reviewing and reporting cardiac complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 853 records, out of which 40 articles were included. Overall analysis showed that the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23-20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38-23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08-3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19-24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 (95% CI: 8.67-23.38) times higher when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (95% CI: 11.85-30.56). CONCLUSION: Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. The importance of cardiac complications is emphasized due to the higher mortality rate among patients with these complications. Thus, troponin screenings and cardiac evaluations are recommended to be performed in routine patient assessments.","Toloui, Amirmohammad; Moshrefiaraghi, Donya; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Haji Aghajani, Mohammad",Arch Acad Emerg Med,9,1

Important seminal studies demonstrating the presence of damage-resistant cell populations together with new isolation and characterization techniques suggest that stem cells exist in the adult lung. More detailed in vivo molecular and cellular characterization of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), other putative lung stem and progenitor cells, and differentiated cells is needed to determine the lineage relationships in adult lung. Lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the most common form of lung cancer in the United States, all involve apparent bronchiolar and alveolar cell defects. It is likely that the delicate balance of stem, progenitor, and differentiated cell functions in the lung is critically affected in patients with these devastating diseases. Thus the discovery of BASCs and other putative lung stem cells will lay the foundation for new inroads to understanding lung biology related to lung disease.","Kim, Carla F",American journal of physiology.

The hantaviral genome encodes three viral proteins: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or L protein), nucleocapsid protein (N), and a glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which is post-translationally cleaved into two surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc. The cytoplasmic tail of Gn interferes with interferon signaling pathways. N is a multifunctional molecule that was shown to be involved in the transcription and translation of viral proteins. N binds to the host mRNA caps and protects the degradation of mRNA 5' termini, which are later snatched and used as primers by the viral RdRp during transcription initiation. N also seems to lure the host translation machinery for the preferential translation of viral transcripts. Moreover, N was shown to delay the induction of cellular apoptosis and facilitate the transport and localization of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by exploiting the cellular cytoskeleton and SUMOlyation machinery. Therefore, with their limited protein coding capacity, hantaviruses have evolved several strategies to modulate cellular pathways for their efficient replication.","Hussein, Islam T M; Mir, Mohammad Ayoub",Frontiers in bioscience,9,33

The nidoviruses are an order of positive-stranded RNA viruses, comprising coronaviruses and arteriviruses, that employ a unique strategy of discontinuous transcription, producing a series of subgenomic mRNAs linking a 5' leader to distal portions of the genome. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 has been shown to be able to bind in vitro to the negative strand of the intergenic sequence, a cis-acting element found in the leader RNA and preceding each downstream ORF in the genome. hnRNP A1 thus has been proposed as a host factor in MHV transcription. To test this hypothesis genetically, we initially constructed MHV mutants with a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site inserted in place of, or adjacent to, an intergenic sequence in the MHV genome. This inserted hnRNP A1 binding site was not able to functionally replace, or enhance transcription from, the intergenic sequence. This finding led us to test more directly the role of hnRNP A1 by analysis of MHV replication and RNA synthesis in a murine cell line that does not express this protein. The cellular absence of hnRNP A1 had no detectable effect on the production of infectious virus, the synthesis of genomic RNA, or the quantity or quality of subgenomic mRNAs. These results strongly suggest that hnRNP A1 is not a required host factor for MHV discontinuous transcription or genome replication.","Shen, X; Masters, P S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,9,28

Caveolin-1 is a protein in the endothelial cell that acts as a shear sensor causing vascular remodeling. This study aimed to elucidate the suitability of different catheter locations and determine the role of caveolin-1 in canine models. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tunneled silicone 14.5-F catheters were inserted into the left jugular vein and right femoral vein in 8 dogs. The dogs were separated into 2 groups by catheter location and were followed up for 28 days. All dogs underwent extracorporeal circulation 3 times a week. After animal sacrifice, histological and immunohistochemical assays were performed to measure specific cell populations. RESULTS There were higher catheter dysfunction rates and lower blood flow rates in the right femoral vein group compared to the left jugular vein group. There was intimal hyperplasia around the catheter tip in both groups with no significant difference between the two groups. There were caveolin-1 expression in the intimal layer of venous wall around the catheter tip location sites in both groups. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that different catheter tip locations may influence catheter function and specific targeting of caveonlin-1 could be a strategy of possible future novel therapies for catheter-related vein stenosis.","Wang, Lihua; Jia, Lan; Wei, Fang; Lu, Zhi; Wang, Bo; Dong, Hongye; Sun, Guijiang; Yu, Haibo; Zhang, Ruining; Jiang, Aili",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,9,1

Methods A total of 1122 HCW (approximately 25% of the employees) of a large tertiary care hospital in India were recruited for this cross-sectional study. COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence. Results The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p < 0.0001). HCW with a history of BCG vaccination in childhood and those who received an adequate prophylactic dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had a lower seroprevalence as compared to those who did not (7.31% vs. 16.8% and 1.30% vs. 11.25% respectively). Conclusion BCG vaccination, HCQ prophylaxis, and the job profile influence the seroprevalence rate in HCW. Seroprevalence rate and follow-up evaluation of its durability may help hospitals to triage their staff at risk, rationalize their placement, prioritize the use of PPE, thereby potentially reducing the risk.","Goenka, Mahesh; Afzalpurkar, Shivaraj; Goenka, Usha; Das, Sudipta Sekhar; Mukherjee, Mohuya; Jajodia, Surabhi; Shah, Bhavik Bharat; Patil, Vikram Uttam; Rodge, Gajanan; Khan, Ujjwayini; Bandyopadhyay, Syamasis",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,9,29

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) is an ideal target for viral antigen-based detection. A rapid and convenient method was developed based on fluorescence immunochromatographic (FIC) assay to detect the SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen. However, the accuracy of this diagnostic method needs to be examined. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out between February 10 and 15, 2020 in 7 hospitals of Wuhan and 1 hospital of Chongqing, China. Participants with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. NP antigen testing by FIC assay and nucleic acid (NA) testing by RT-PCR were performed simultaneously in a blind manner with the same nasopharyngeal swab sample. The diagnostic accuracy of NP antigen testing was calculated by taking NA testing of RT-PCR as reference standard, in which samples with cycle threshold (Ct) value &#8804; 40 were interpreted as SARS-CoV-2 positives. RESULTS: A total of 253 participants were enrolled and 2 participants were excluded from the analyses due to invalid NP testing results. Of 251 participants (99.2%) that were included in the diagnostic accuracy analysis, a total of 201 participants (80.1%) had a Ct value &#8804;40. With Ct value 40 as the cut-off of NA testing, the sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement of the FIC assay was 75.6% (95% CI 69.0%-81.3%), 100% (95% CI 91.1%-100%), and 80.5% (95% CI 75.1%-84.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With RT-PCR assay as reference standard, NP antigen testing by FIC assay shows high specificity and relative high sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the early phase of infection.","Diao, Bo; Wen, Kun; Zhang, Ji; Chen, Jian; Han, Chao; Chen, Yongwen; Wang, Shufeng; Deng, Guohong; Zhou, Hongwei; Wu, Yuzhang",Clin. microbiol. infect,9,24

The increasing amount of event logs in organizations challenges current process mining techniques, which tend to load data into the memory of a computer. This issue limits the organizations to apply process mining on a large scale and introduces risks due to the lack of data management capabilities. Therefore, this paper introduces and formalizes a new approach to store and retrieve event logs into/from graph databases. It defines an algorithm to compute Directly Follows Graph (DFG) inside the graph database, which shifts the heavy computation parts of process mining into the graph database. Calculating DFG in graph databases enables leveraging the graph databases' horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities in favor of applying process mining on a large scale. Besides, it removes the requirement to move data into analysts' computer. Thus, it enables using data management capabilities in graph databases. We implemented this approach in Neo4j and evaluated its performance compared with current techniques using a real log file. The result shows that our approach enables the calculation of DFG when the data is much bigger than the computational memory. It also shows better performance when dicing data into small chunks.","Jalali, Amin",,9,30

Using US supermarket scanner data covering the 2008 Global Rice Crisis, an episode driven by an observable cost shock due an Indian ban on raw rice exports, we find that sticky prices account for a sizeable fraction of hoarding.

Safe and effective vaccines are thus urgently needed to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and ease the major economic impact. There has been an unprecedented rapid response by vaccine developers with now over one hundred vaccine candidates in development and at least six having reached clinical trials. However, a major challenge during rapid development is to avoid safety issues both by thoughtful vaccine design and by thorough evaluation in a timely manner. A syndrome of ""disease enhancement"" has been reported in the past for a few viral vaccines where those immunized suffered increased severity or death when they later encountered the virus or were found to have an increased frequency of infection. Animal models allowed scientists to determine the underlying mechanism for the former in the case of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and have been utilized to design and screen new RSV vaccine candidates. Because some Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV-1 vaccines have shown evidence of disease enhancement in some animal models, this is a particular concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To address this challenge, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Brighton Collaboration (BC) Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) convened a scientific working meeting on March 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to consider what vaccine designs could reduce safety concerns and how animal models and immunological assessments in early clinical trials can help to assess the risk.

A literature search was performed from 1979 to 2020 using the terms: 'Parkinson's disease' and 'parkinsonism' combined with: 'COVID-19'; 'SARS-CoV-2' and 'coronavirus'. It does not appear that PD is a specific risk factor for COVID-19. There is evidence for direct/indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on motor/non-motor symptoms of PD. Although many PD patients present with typical COVID-19 symptoms, some present atypically with isolated worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, requiring increased anti-PD therapy and having worse outcomes. Mortality data on PD patients with COVID-19 is inconclusive (ranging from 5.2%to 100%). Patients with advanced PD appear to be particularly vulnerable. Single cases of acute hypokinetic-rigid syndrome have been described but no other convincing data has been reported.

Here, we discuss potential long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its possibility to cause permanent damage to the immune system and the central nervous system. Advanced chronological age is one of the main risk factors for the adverse outcomes of COVID-19, presumably due to immunosenescence and chronic low-grade inflammation, both characteristic of the elderly. The combination of viral infection and chronic inflammation in advanced chronological age might cause multiple detrimental unforeseen consequences for the predisposition and severity of neurodegenerative diseases and needs to be considered so that we can be prepared to deal with future outcomes of the ongoing pandemic.","Domingues, Renato; Lippi, Alice; Setz, Cristian; Outeiro, Tiago F; Krisko, Anita",Aging (Albany NY),9,5

During peak hours, it is common to see oversaturated conditions (i.e., passenger demand exceeds network capacity), which bring significant operational risks and safety issues. A popular control intervention is to restrict the entering rate during peak hours by setting up out-of-station queueing with crowd control barriers. The \textit{out-of-station waiting} can make up a substantial proportion of total travel time but is not well-studied in the literature. Accurate quantification of out-of-station waiting time is important to evaluating the social benefit and cost of service scheduling/optimization plans; however, out-of-station waiting time is difficult to estimate because it is not a part of smart card transactions. In this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate the out-of-station waiting time by leveraging the information from a small group of transfer passengers -- those who transfer from nearby bus routes to the metro station. Based on the estimated transfer time for this small group, we first infer the out-of-station waiting time for all passengers by developing a Gaussian Process regression with a Student-$t$ likelihood and then use the estimated out-of-station waiting time to build queueing diagrams. We apply our method to the Tiantongyuan North station of Beijing metro as a case study; our results show that the maximum out-of-station waiting time can reach 15 minutes, and the maximum queue length can be over 3000 passengers. Our results suggest that out-of-station waiting can cause significant travel costs and thus should be considered in analyzing transit performance, mode choice, and social benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantitative study for out-of-station waiting time.","Zhu, Kangli; Cheng, Zhanhong; Wu, Jianjun; Yuan, Fuya; Sun, Lijun",,9,30

In the current clinical environment, COVID-19 is one of the most important clinical differential diagnoses in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. The optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for these patients has been a constant topic of discussion and very importantly so, since a great majority of these patients require invasive mechanical ventilation and often for an extended period of time. In this report we highlight our experience with a COVID-19 patient who most likely suffered barotrauma either as a result of traumatic endotracheal intubation or primarily due to COVID-19 itself. We also aim to highlight the current literature available to suggest the management strategy for these patients for a favorable outcome. The cases described are diverse in terms of age variance and other comorbidities. According to the literature, certain patients, with COVID-19 disease and spontaneous pneumothorax were noted to be managed conservatively and oxygen supplementation with nasal cannula sufficed. Decision regarding need and escalation to invasive mechanical ventilation should be taken early in the disease to avoid complications such as patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) and barotrauma sequelae such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum Recent systematic review further supports the fact that the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in certain patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may give a false sense of security and clinical stabilization but has no overall benefit to avoid intubation. While invasive mechanical ventilation may be associated with higher rates of barotrauma, this should not mean that intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be delayed. This becomes an important consideration when non-intensivists or personnel with less experience provide care for this vulnerable patient population who may rely too heavily on NIV to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation.","Lal, A.; Mishra, A.

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. OBJECTIVES: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords ""COVID 19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""treatment."" All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. DISCUSSION: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. CONCLUSION: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.","Mehta, Nikita; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Alkindi, Nour; Pourmand, Ali",Am J Emerg Med,9,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational study included 59 consecutive patients. The main goals were to evaluate the number, characteristics and practical conditions of tracheostomies, and the COVID-19 status of the otorhinolaryngologists. Secondary goals were to analyse tracheostomy time, decannulation rate, immediate postoperative complications and laryngotracheal axis status. RESULTS: Tracheostomy indications were for ventilatory weaning and extubation failure in 86% and 14% of cases, respectively. The technique was surgical, percutaneous or hybrid in 91.5%, 3.4% and 5.1% of cases, respectively. None of the operators developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Postoperative complications occurred in 15% of cases, with no significant difference between surgical and percutaneous/hybrid techniques (P=0.33), although no complications occurred after percutaneous or hybrid tracheostomies. No procedures or complications resulted in death. The decannulation rate was 74.5% with a mean tracheostomy time of 20±12 days. In 55% of the patients evaluated by flexible endoscopy after decannulation, a laryngeal abnormality was found. On univariate analysis, no clinical features had a significant influence on tracheostomy time, decannulation rate or occurrence of laryngeal lesions. CONCLUSION: The main findings of the present retrospective study were: absence of contamination of the surgeons, heterogeneity of practices between centres, a high rate of complications and laryngeal lesions whatever the technique, and the specificities of the patients.","Bartier, S; La Croix, C; Evrard, D; Hervochon, R; Laccourreye, O; Gasne, C; Excoffier, A; Tanaka, L; Barry, B; Coste, A; Tankere, F; Kania, R; Nevoux, J",Eur. ann. otorhinolaryngol. head neck dis,9,16

The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour. Scientists globally also need to up their game to design more specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counteract the pandemic. In this Viewpoint, we provide a brief outline of the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss some probable ways to design therapeutic strategies to overcome the present global crisis.","Das, Gaurav; Mukherjee, Nabanita; Ghosh, Surajit",ACS Chem Neurosci,9,21

However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example, ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy, increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing. PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from contacts of confirmed cases is also described.","Yu, Ssu-Hsin",,9,1

The earliest infection can be traced back to Wuhan, China. From there it has spread all over the world. Keeping in view the above perspective, an attempt is made in order to find out the epidemiological pattern of COVID 19 pandemic, if any, in different geo-climatological regions of the world in terms of case incidence and mortality. This study is also an endeavor to review and analyze the gradual changes of the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. The raw data of COVID-19 cases and death incidences were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) website from the time period: 1st April to 6th April, 2020. The data that are utilized here for general and Case fatality rate (CFR) based analysis. Western pacific region, European region and Americas have the greatest number of infected cases (P < 0.001); whereas deaths have been found to be significantly higher in Europe (P < 0.001). Total number of confirmed cases and deaths in south-east Asia are comparatively lower (P < 0.001). Case fatality rate (CFR) has also found significant for European region. SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be a strain of SARS-CoV that has a high rate of pathogenicity and transmissibility. Result indicated that the European region has been affected mostly for both cases and death incidences. The novel mutations in SARS-CoV-2 possibly increase the virus infectivity. Genetic heterogeneity of this virus within the human population might originate as the representatives of naturally selected virus quasispecies. In this context, the presence of the asymptomatic individuals could be a significant concern for SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

This research work evaluates the difference of extracted RNA purity of pooled samples with and without treatment with isopropyl alcohol and its effect on real-time RT-PCR. As per the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 5 sample pools were analysed using qRT-PCR. A total of 100 pooled samples were selected for the study by mixing 50 µL of one COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimen and 50 µL each of 4 known negative specimens. Pool RNA was extracted using the column-based method, and 1 set of pooled extracted RNA was tested as such, while RNA of the second set was treated additionally with chilled isopropyl alcohol (modified protocol). Further, the purity of extracted RNA in both the groups was checked using Microvolume Spectrophotometers (Nanodrop) followed by RT-PCR targeting E-gene and RNaseP target. The results showed that the purity index of extracted RNA of untreated pooled specimens was inferior to isopropyl alcohol-treated templates, which was observed to be 85% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The average Cq (E gene) in the unpurified and purified pool RNA group was 34.66 and 31.48, respectively. The nanodrop data suggested that purified RNA concentration was significantly increased with an average value of 24.73 ± 1.49 ng/uL, which might be the reason for high sensitivity and specificity. Thus, this group testing of SARS-CoV-2 cases using pools of 5 individual samples would be the best alternative for saving molecular reagents, personnel time, and can increase the overall testing capacity. However, purity of RNA is one of the important determinants to procure unfailing results, thus, this additional purification step must be included in the protocol after RNA has been extracted using commercially available kit before performing qRT-PCR.","Gangwar, Mayank; Shukla, Alka; Patel, Virendra Kumar; Prakash, Pradyot; Nath, Gopal",Biomed Res Int,9,21

AIM OF THE STUDY: To report the remodeling of the Vascular Surgery Department of San Raffaele Hospital as regards the strategies of preparation, escalation, and return to normal activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. PREPARATION, ESCALATION, DE-ESCALATION: The Regional Authority of Lombardy remodeled the hospitalization system to allocate appropriate resources to treat patients with COVID-19 and to identify ""Hub/Spoke"" hospitals for highly specialized medical activities. The Hubs hospitals were required to guarantee full-time evaluation of all patients presenting with cardiovascular diseases with an independent pathway for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection. San Raffaele Hospital was identified as Hub for cardiovascular emergencies and the Vascular Surgery Department was remodeled to face this epidemic situation. Surgical treatment was reserved only to symptomatic, urgent, or emergent cases. Large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganized to assist patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: During this period, 135 patients were referred to San Raffaele Vascular Surgery Department. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 24 patients and, among them, acute limb ischemia was the most common cause of admission. At this time, the COVID-19 trend is in decline in Italy, and the local authorities reorganized the healthcare system to return to normal activities avoiding new escalations of COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered in Lombardy as a cataclysm. Nevertheless, the HUB/spoke system has proven to be a valid model in the management of ischemic emergencies. Continuous surveillance, cooperation, coordination, and communication to effectively respond to COVID-19 pandemic is crucial because COVID-19 reference centers could face similar issues in the near future.","Chiesa, Roberto; Kahlberg, Andrea; Rinaldi, Enrico; Mascia, Daniele",J. card. surg,9,20

With respect to a human borne illnesses, a superspreader is someone who is more likely to infect other humans when compared to a typically infected person. The existence of human superspreaders is deeply entrenched in history; the most famous case being that of Typhoid Mary. Through contact tracing, epidemiologists have identified human superspreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and SARS. The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has shifted the focus back on the superspreaders. We herein present a case report of a COVID-19 superspreader with a hitherto unusually high number of infected contacts. The index case was a 33 year old male who resided in a low income settlement comprising of rehabilitated slum dwellers and worked as a healthcare worker (HCW) in a tertiary care hospital and had tested positive for COVID-19.On contact tracing, he had a total of 125 contacts, of which 49 COVID-19 infections had direct or indirect contact with the index case, qualifying him as a ""superspreader."" This propagated infection led to an outbreak in the community. Contact tracing, testing and isolation of such superspreaders from the other members of the community is essential to stop the spread of this disease and contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mohindra, Ritin; Ghai, Arushi; Brar, Rinnie; Khandelwal, Neha; Biswal, Manisha; Suri, Vikas; Goyal, Kapil; Singh, Mini P; Bhalla, Ashish; Rana, Kirtan; Lakshmi, P V M",J Prim Care Community Health,9,20

Second-year medical students (M2s) serve as teaching assistants (TAs) for this course and their responsibilities include leading comprehensive review sessions prior to each set of exams. Historically, such reviews have taken place in small-group classrooms, with groups of 10-18 M1s rotating through a series of rooms, each hosting a rapid-fire review of a specific topic, conducted by several TAs. In 2020, the virtual setting imposed by COVID-19 restrictions demanded creativity to rethink the format of these review sessions, leading to the implementation of a large-group, interactive format, with all M1s in the same remote video session, covering material at a slower pace. We here examine the effectiveness of this large-group, interactive format. Methods: The first two review sessions of Structures 2020 mimicked the traditional style, with groups of M1s rotating through a series of 20-minute Zoom sessions led by M2s TAs. For the last two review sessions, all students remained in one 3-hour Zoom session, and TAs covered certain material at certain times, with more or less time allotted depending on the difficulty and amount of material. TAs also incorporated more interactivity with real time quizzes on high-yield topics and direct practical questions through the review. We surveyed M1s regarding which format they preferred and also solicited qualitative feedback from M1s and TAs throughout Structures. Results: 55% of M1s preferred the large-group format, with 23% preferring the traditional format and 23% expressing no preference. Many TAs also expressed preferences for the large-group format. Qualitative feedback from M1s indicated that they appreciated the interactivity with quizzes and practical questions. Conclusion: In the remote environment, most students preferred a large-group, interactive format over the small-group rotation format. Main advantages observed were: 1) time flexibility: complex components of the session addressing challenging topics were covered more extensively and in-depth;2) In the large group, all M1s experience the session equally, including the answers to all questions from their classmates. Such interactivity is not compatible with the small group format and can be challenging in its compressed timeframe. 3) optimization of M2 TAs workforce: in the large session TAs are assigned with a section of the review and lead the review of their only once, for a short period of time, while in the small group format, TAs are required to repeat the review of their topic multiple times.

The model describes the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.","Viguerie, Alex; Lorenzo, Guillermo; Auricchio, Ferdinando; Baroli, Davide; Hughes, Thomas J.R.; Patton, Alessia; Reali, Alessandro; Yankeelov, Thomas E.; Veneziani, Alessandro",,9,24

METHOD: An overview of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. RESULTS: Evaluation of digital health technologies for COVID-19 should be based on their technical maturity as well as the scale of implementation. For mature technologies like telehealth whose efficacy has been previously demonstrated, pragmatic, rapid evaluation using the complex systems paradigm which accounts for multiple sociotechnical factors, might be more suitable to examine their effectiveness and emerging safety concerns in new settings. New technologies, particularly those intended for use on a large scale such as digital contract tracing, will require assessment of their usability as well as performance prior to deployment, after which evaluation should shift to using a complex systems paradigm to examine the value of information provided. The success of a digital health technology is dependent on the value of information it provides relative to the sociotechnical context of the setting where it is implemented. CONCLUSION: Commitment to evaluation using the evidence-based medicine and complex systems paradigms will be critical to ensuring safe and effective use of digital health technologies for COVID-19 and future pandemics. There is an inherent tension between evaluation and the imperative to urgently deploy solutions that needs to be negotiated.","Magrabi, Farah; Ammenwerth, Elske; Craven, Catherine K; Cresswell, Kathrin; De Keizer, Nicolet F; Medlock, Stephanie K; Scott, Philip J; Wong, Zoie Shui-Yee; Georgiou, Andrew",Yearb. med. inform.

The current COVID-19 outbreak caused a pandemic with millions of infected patients and death cases worldwide. The clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was initially linked with respiratory disorders, but recent studies have reported alterations of neurological and cerebrovascular functions in COVID-19 patients. The main viral infection features are related to cell death, inflammation, and cytokine generation, which can be associated with the dysregulation of redox systems or oxidative stress. However, until now, there is no available and effective therapeutic approach. Thus, it is necessary to search for care and adequate protection against the disease, especially for susceptible and vulnerable groups. Preconditioning, a well-known antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory approach, is protective against many neurological age-related disorders. COVID-19 severity and morbidity have been observed in elderly patients. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the possible protective role of oxidative preconditioning in aged patients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications.","Akki, Rachid; Fath, Nada; Mohti, Hicham",ACS Chem Neurosci,9,21

We use a cross-country regression analysis and find a positive correlation between international tourism and the cumulated level of COVID-19 confirmed cases and death by April 30, 2020. Our regression analyses show that countries exposed to high flows of international tourism are more prone to cases and deaths caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. This association is robust even after controlling for other socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 outbreak and regional dummies. Based on our estimations, a 1% higher level of inbound and outbound tourism is associated with 1.2% and 1.4% higher levels of confirmed COVID-19 cases and death, respectively, controlling for other factors. When we normalize the number of cases and death by size of population, the statistical significance remains robust, especially for the COVID-19 deaths, while the effect size reduces.","Farzanegan, Mohammad Reza; Gholipour, Hassan F.; Feizi, Mehdi; Nunkoo, Robin; Andargoli, Amir Eslami",J.

RESULTS: Twenty-two patients developed IRAF (33%). Age at initiation of ibrutinib was significantly associated with IRAF (65.1 years vs 74.1 years, P = .002). Mean ibrutinib dose was lower among patients who developed IRAF (388.2 ± 121.7 vs 448.6 ± 88.4, P = .025). E/e' was significantly higher among patients who developed IRAF (11.5 vs 9.3, P = .04). PALS was significantly lower in patients who developed AF (30.3% vs 36.3%, P = .01). On multivariate regression analysis, age, PALS, and PACS were significantly associated with IRAF. On multivariate regression analysis, only PACS remained significantly associated with IRAF while accounting for age. CONCLUSIONS: Age, ibrutinib dose, E/e', and PALS on pre-treatment echocardiogram were significantly associated with development of IRAF. On multivariate regression analyses, age, PALS, and PACS remained significantly associated with IRAF. Impaired LA mechanics add to the assessment of patients at risk for IRAF.","Singh, Arushi; El Hangouche, Nadia; McGee, Katherine; Gong, Fei-Fei; Lentz, Robert; Feinglass, Joseph; Akhter, Nausheen",Echocardiography,9,21

The effective reproduction number Rt is the standard index used in many countries for this goal. However, it is known that due to the delays between infection and case registration, its use for decision making is somewhat limited. In this paper a near real-time COVINDEX is proposed for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic. The index is computed from predictions obtained from a GAM beta regression for modelling the test positive rate as a function of time. The proposal is illustrated using data on COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared with Rt. A simple chart is also proposed for monitoring local and national outbreaks by policy makers and public health officials.","Scrucca, Luca",,9,30

We describe an unusual presentation of the rare R377W PSEN1 mutation with a late age of onset, and we provide for the first time in vivo pathological evidence for this mutation. METHODS: A 71-years old female patient with progressive cognitive decline in the past three years and positive family history for dementia underwent neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture, conventional brain imaging, amyloid-PET and extensive genetic screening with a next generation sequencing technique. RESULTS: The diagnostic work-up revealed mixed behavioural and amnestic disease features on neuropsychological tests, MRI, and FDG-PET. Amyloid-PET detected amyloid deposition in the frontal areas, in the parietal lobes and the precunei. The genetic screening unraveled the presence of the rare R377W mutation in the PSEN1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive genetic screening is advisable also for late-onset presentations of Alzheimer's disease, especially in the presence of a positive family history or atypical clinical features.","Scarioni, Marta; Arighi, Andrea; Fenoglio, Chiara; Sorrentino, Federica; Serpente, Maria; Rotondo, Emanuela; Mercurio, Matteo; Marotta, Giorgio; Dijkstra, Anke A; Pijnenburg, Yolande A L; Scarpini, Elio; Galimberti, Daniela",Eur. j. neurol,9,16

Regardless of the use of social media by some instructors as a personal initiative, in Iraq, social media's use for educational purposes has been neglected. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the world to implement online teaching using varying technology applications including social media as an essential tool in the learning process. This shifted the Iraqi government’s understanding of social media's role in education to the extent that they formally recommended that the educational departments, schools, universities use social media as a formal platform to keep the education going. However, there were concerns about using social media for several factors such as internet services, information and communication technology skills of instructors and students, integrity, and quality insurance of education. This study investigated the teachers' and students’perceptions regarding these concerns by adopting a survey method through an online questionnaire using 'google forms' (N= 2010) with responses from teachers and students of universities and high schools and parents of students of basic schools. This study revealed that less than half of the respondents were in favor of using social media in the learning process. The findings suggested that the educational level, age, and geographical hierarchies and jobs of respondents are also correlated with using social media and e-learning. © 2021 Alaa Makki and Ahmed Omar Bali.

In most, the interval between disease onset and death is relatively short (<1 month). Information regarding lung pathology in patients who survive for longer periods is scant. We describe the pathology in three patients with severe COVID-19 who underwent antemortem examination of lung tissue at least 8 weeks after initial diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series. RESULTS: The first patient developed acute respiratory failure and was started on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on day 21, with subsequent hemothorax. Debridement (day 38) showed extensive lung infarction with diffuse alveolar damage and Candida overgrowth. The second patient developed acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that did not improve despite ECMO. Surgical lung biopsy on day 74 showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis with focal microscopic honeycomb change. The third patient also required ECMO and underwent bilateral lung transplantation on day 126. The explanted lungs showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis with focal microscopic honeycomb change. CONCLUSIONS: This series provides histologic confirmation that complications of COVID-19 after 8 weeks to 4 months of severe disease include lung infarction and diffuse interstitial fibrosis.","Aesif, Scott W; Bribriesco, Alejandro C; Yadav, Ruchi; Nugent, Summer L; Zubkus, Dmitriy; Tan, Carmela D; Mehta, Atul C; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay",Am. j. clin. pathol,9,24

In view of this, patients with head and neck cancer may present with oral complications due to anticancer therapy, making dental assistance necessary. Thus, the objective of the study was to review the literature and critically discuss important concerns about the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because dental professionals are in close contact with the main viral transmission routes, this study presents recommendations for management and protection during clinical dental care. The main characteristics and transmission routes of COVID-19 are also discussed. Dental professionals should control pain and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment and use preventive measures for infection control. During this pandemic, patients with head and neck cancer should not undergo elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or a history of COVID-19; therefore, in asymptomatic or painless cases, only preventive actions are recommended. In symptomatic or painful cases, precautions for safe interventional treatments must be implemented by following the hygiene measures recommended by health agencies and using personal protective equipment. During health crises, new protocols emerge for cancer treatment, and professionals must act with greater attention toward biosafety and updated knowledge. It is important to offer adequate individualized treatment based on the recommendations of preventative and interventional treatments so that patients can face this difficult period with optimized quality of life.","Miranda, Rafael Resende de; Lopes, Camila de Carvalho Almança; Franco, Nathália Maria Afonso Silveira; Cabral, Luana Cardoso; Simamoto JÚnior, Paulo Cézar; Novais, Veridiana Resende",Braz Oral Res,9,33

We speculated that the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (travel restriction and alcohol ban) would affect trauma patterns. OBJECTIVES: To compare the burden and nature of trauma over the COVID-19 lockdown period with the equivalent period over the past 5 years using routinely collected data from the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. METHODS: All trauma patients admitted to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg between 23 March 2015 and 31 May 2020 were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 8 859 trauma patients were admitted over the 6-year period, with a total of 1 676 admitted during the periods 23 March - 31 May. These 1 676 formed the study cohort. Of these patients, 998 had sustained blunt trauma, 665 penetrating trauma, and 13 a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma. A total of 14 categories of blunt trauma were reviewed, of which the three most common were assault, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and pedestrian vehicle accidents (PVAs). Between 23 March and 31 May 2020, a total of 23 patients were victims of blunt assault. The median number of assault victims over the equivalent period during the previous 5 years was 48. The 5 preceding years had a median of 56 MVAs and 33 PVAs, compared with 23 and 10 during the lockdown. The median number of gunshot wound (GSW) victims for the preceding years was 41, compared with 30 during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 24 stab wound victims were admitted, compared with a median of 73 for the preceding years. The proportion of females who sustained penetrating trauma and blunt assault increased significantly during the lockdown. The proportion of females sustaining a GSW or blunt trauma secondary to an MVA remained constant. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that during the period of lockdown in SA there was a significant decrease in MVAs, PVAs and interpersonal violence. Assaults involving a knife seemed to decrease dramatically, but the rate of GSWs remained constant.","Zsilavecz, A; Wain, H; Bruce, J L; Smith, M T D; Bekker, W; Laing, G L; Lutge, E; Clarke, D L",S Afr Med J,9,30

Its antiviral properties have been studied for years; regarding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has been shown that HCQ may act at multiple levels. These extend from the initial attachment of the virus to the respiratory epithelium to the inhibition of its replication by the alkalinisation of the phagolysosome's microenvironment and the post-translational modification of certain viral proteins. Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results. In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role. Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed. In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.","Tselios, Konstantinos; Skendros, Panagiotis",,9,16

Thus, increasing the likelihood of periodontitis and gingivitis caused by COVID-19. The cytokine storm during COVID-19 similarly arises during periodontal inflammation. Studies have reported that NOD-Like Receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is significant in the cytokine storm. Recently, the course of the COVID-19 has been related to the melatonin levels in both COVID-19 and periodontal diseases. It is known that melatonin prevents the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In light of these findings, we think that melatonin treatment during COVID-19 or periodontal diseases may prevent the damage seen in periodontal tissues by preventing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.","Sehirli, Ahmet Özer; Aksoy, Umut; Koca-Ünsal, Revan Birke; Sayiner, Serkan",Med Hypotheses,9,24

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2 and April 14, 2020 to a large academic medical center in New York City, we describe outcomes associated with tocilizumab 400 mg (without methylprednisolone) compared to a propensity-matched control. The primary endpoints were change in a 7-point ordinal scale of oxygenation and ventilator free survival, both at days 14 and 28. Secondary endpoints include incidence of bacterial superinfections and gastrointestinal perforation. Primary outcomes were evaluated using t-test. RESULTS: We identified 33 patients who received tocilizumab and matched 74 controls based on demographics and health measures upon admission. After adjusting for illness severity and baseline ordinal scale, we failed to find evidence of an improvement in hypoxemia based on an ordinal scale at hospital day 14 in the tocilizumab group (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 0.7-6.5; p = 0.157) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-3.6; p = 0.82). There also was no evidence of an improvement in ventilator-free survival at day 14 (OR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.18-3.5; p = 0.75) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.1-1.8; p = 0.23). There was no increase in secondary bacterial infection rates in the tocilizumab group compared to controls (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09-1.53; p = 0.168). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to support an improvement in hypoxemia or ventilator-free survival with use of tocilizumab 400 mg in the absence of corticosteroids.

In this paper, an assessment of primary Hg mining in Mexico was conducted, with a focus on four sites in Querétaro State. Atmospheric Hg concentrations were measured at two of those sites. In addition, trade data was examined, including Hg exports from Mexico and imports by countries that have a large artisanal gold mining (AGM) sector. Results showed that while annual Hg production in Mexico has ramped up in recent years, official Hg exports reduced from 307 tonnes in 2015 to 63 tonnes in 2019. Since 2010, mercury exports to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia have represented 77% of Mexico’s total Hg trade. As the large majority of Hg trade with these countries is apparently destined for the AGM sector, which is contrary to Article 3 of the Minamata Convention, there is evidence that increased international scrutiny has led to an increase in unregulated international transfers.

Treatment is tocilizumab. The use of glucocorticoids (GC) is controversial. In other very similar CSS, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS), the main treatment are corticosteroids. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19. PATIENTS: We included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab. We determine CSS markers. We evaluated mortality, intubation, and a combined variable. RESULTS: In all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered. The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival. DISCUSSION: The early use of GC pulses could control SLC, with a lower requirement to use tocilizumab and a decrease in events such as intubation and death.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Luna Del Castillo, Juan de Dios; de la Hera Fernández, Javier; Guirao Arrabal, Emilio; Colmenero Ruiz, Manuel; Ortego Centeno, Norberto",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),9,20

However, sharing diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually not allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy, which causes the issue of insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm which produces an unbiased global model based on the received updates of local models trained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. However, the default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data heterogeneity of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we present architecture for dynamic fusion based federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Second, we design a decision making mechanism for clients to decides each round's participation based on the local model performance. Third, we propose an aggregation scheduling method to dynamically select the participating clients based on each participating client's training time. Fourth, we summarise a category of medical diagnostic image datasets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication efficiency and fault tolerance.","Zhang, Weishan; Zhou, Tao; Lu, Qinghua; Wang, Xiao; Zhu, Chunsheng; Sun, Haoyun; Wang, Zhipeng; Wang, Fei-Yue",,9,30

However, given the speed of this pandemic, paralleled with the pressure to develop and provide serological tests in an expediated manner, not every assay has undergone the rigorous evaluation that is usually associated with medical diagnostic assays. We aimed to examine the performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assays among participants with confirmed COVID-19 disease and negative controls. Methods Serum taken between day 17 and day 40 post onset of symptoms from 41 healthcare workers with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease, and pre-pandemic serum from 20 negative controls, were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using 7 different assays including point-of-care (POC) and laboratory-based assays. Results Assay performance varied. The lab-based Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay proved to be the assay with the best positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy. The POC Nal von Minden GmbH and Biozek assays also performed well. Conclusion Our research demonstrates the variations in performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays.

Democracies aim to build trust in government and enable checks and balances on decision-making, which may be useful in a pandemic. On the other hand, democratic governments have been criticised as slow to enforce restrictive policies and being overly influenced by public opinion. This study sought to understand whether strength of democratic governance is associated with the variation in excess mortality observed across countries during the pandemic. MethodsThrough linking open-access datasets we constructed univariable and multivariable linear regression models investigating the association between country EIU Democracy Index (representing strength of democratic governance on a scale of 0 to 10) and excess mortality rates, from February 2020 to May 2021. We stratified our analysis into high-income and low and middle-income country groups and adjusted for several important confounders. ResultsAcross 78 countries, the mean EIU democracy index was 6.74 (range 1.94 to 9.81) and the mean excess mortality rate was 128 per 100,000 (range -55 to 503 per 100,000). A one-point increase in EIU Democracy Index was associated with a decrease in excess mortality of 26.3 per 100,000 (p=0.002), after accounting for COVID-19 cases, age [≥] 65, gender, prevalence of cardiovascular disease, universal health coverage and the strength of early government restrictions. This association was particularly strong in high-income countries ({beta} -47.5, p<0.001) but non-significant in low and middle-income countries ({beta} -10.8, p=0.40). ConclusionsSocio-political factors related to the way societies are governed have played an important role in mitigating the overall health impact of COVID-19. Given the omission of such considerations from outbreak risk assessment tools, and their particular significance in high-income countries rated most highly by such tools, this study strengthens the case to broaden the scope of traditional pandemic risk assessment.

Mild cases may look like the common cold, while cases with severe disease may represent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging infection and the number of COVID-19 cases and its associated deaths are quickly growing around the world. COVID-19 infection can involve multiple body organs other than respiratory tract and lungs such as liver. It is hypothesized that COVID-19-associated liver injury can hamper the host drug metabolism and excretion.

Our COV-VACC study is evaluating the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with B cell malignancies. Eligible patients were either receiving active treatment or had received treatment within the last 24 months. Patients were vaccinated with either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) (n=41) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) (n=14) vaccines. The median age of participants was 60 years (range: 27-82) and 50% were receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at the time of vaccination. This interim analysis from the first 55 participants describes anti-S seropositivity rates, neutralising antibody activity and association with peripheral lymphocyte subsets. After the first vaccine dose, 36% overall had detectable anti-S antibodies rising to 42% after the second dose. Sera from seropositive patients was assessed for neutralisation activity in vitro. Of the seropositive patients after first dose (n=17), only 41% were able to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus with a 50% inhibitory dilution factor (ID50) of >1:50. After two doses (n=21) 57% of the seropositive patients had detectable neutralisation activity (median ID50 of 1:469, range 1:70 - 1:3056). Total blood lymphocyte, CD19, CD4 and CD56 counts were significantly associated with seropositivity. Patients vaccinated more than 6 months after completing therapy were significantly more likely to develop antibodies than those within 6 months of treatment or on active treatment; OR: 5.93 (1.29 - 27.28). Our data has important implications for patients with B cell malignancies as we demonstrate a disconnect between anti-S seropositivity and virus neutralisation in vitro following vaccination against COVID-19.

However, the mask adoption rate in the US is still less than optimal. This study aims to understand the beliefs held by individuals who oppose the use of facial masks, and the evidence that they use to support these beliefs, to inform the development of targeted public health communication strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 771,268 US-based tweets between January to October 2020. We developed machine-learning classifiers to identify and categorize relevant tweets, followed by a qualitative content analysis of a subset of the tweets to understand the rationale of those opposed mask wearing. RESULTS: We identified 267,152 tweets that contained personal opinions about wearing facial masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of the tweets supported mask wearing, the proportion of anti-mask tweets stayed constant at about 10% level throughout the study period. Common reasons for opposition included physical discomfort and negative effects, lack of effectiveness, and being unnecessary or inappropriate for certain people or under certain circumstances. The opposing tweets were significantly less likely to cite external sources of information such as public health agencies' websites to support the arguments. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Combining machine learning and qualitative content analysis is an effective strategy for identifying public attitudes toward mask wearing and the reasons for opposition. The results may inform better communication strategies to improve the public perception of wearing masks and, in particular, to specifically address common anti-mask beliefs.","He, Lu; He, Changyang; Reynolds, Tera L; Bai, Qiushi; Huang, Yicong; Li, Chen; Zheng, Kai; Chen, Yunan",J. am. med. inform. assoc,9,33

METHODS: Two investigators searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv databases for articles published through March 30, 2020. Retrospective studies assessing the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and levels of troponin I (TnI) and other cardiac injury biomarkers (creatine kinase [CK], CK myocardial band [CK-MB], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were included. The data were extracted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: The analysis included 23 studies with 4631 total individuals. The proportions of severe disease, ICU admission, or death among patients with non-elevated TnI (or troponin T [TnT]), and those with elevated TnI (or TnT) were 12.0% and 64.5%, 11.8% and 56.0%, and 8.2% and. 59.3%, respectively. Patients with elevated TnI levels had significantly higher risks of severe disease, ICU admission, and death (RR 5.57, 95% CI 3.04 to 10.22, P < 0.001; RR 6.20, 95% CI 2.52 to 15.29, P < 0.001; RR 5.64, 95% CI 2.69 to 11.83, P < 0.001). Patients with an elevated CK level were at significantly increased risk of severe disease or ICU admission (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.61, P < 0.001). Patients with elevated CK-MB levels were at a higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 3.24, 95% CI 1.66 to 6.34, P = 0.001). Patients with newly occurring arrhythmias were at higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission (RR 13.09, 95% CI 7.00 to 24.47, P < 0.001). An elevated IL-6 level was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease, requiring ICU admission, or death. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with elevated TnI levels are at significantly higher risk of severe disease, ICU admission, and death. Elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and IL-6 levels and emerging arrhythmia are associated with the development of severe disease and need for ICU admission, and the mortality is significantly higher in patients with elevated LDH and IL-6 levels.","Li, Xinye; Pan, Xiandu; Li, Yanda; An, Na; Xing, Yanfen; Yang, Fan; Tian, Li; Sun, Jiahao; Gao, Yonghong; Shang, Hongcai; Xing, Yanwei",Crit Care,9,16

Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. RESULTS: The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lateef, Tooba; Chen, Jiyao; Tahir, Muhammad; Lateef, Teba Abdul; Chen, Bryan Z.; Li, Jizhen; Zhang, Stephen X.",Global Health,9,10

Many discourses and practices surrounding hospitals’ new investments in information and communication technologies tend to revolve around security provision. Oftentimes, however, scenarios of extreme and exceptional circumstances are used to justify the implementation of identification and tracking technologies that may be more about managerial control than patient care. Drawing upon qualitative research in 23 U.S. hospitals from 2007 to 2009, our analysis focuses on hospitals’ deployment of identification and location technologies that manage patients, track personnel, and generate data in real-time. These systems are framed as aiding in the process of managing supplies and medications for pandemic flu outbreaks, monitoring exposure patterns for infectious diseases, and helping triage or manage the location and condition of patients during mass casualty disasters. We show that in spite of the framing of security and emergency preparedness, these technologies are primarily managerial tools for hospital administrators. Just as systems can be used to track infection vectors, those same systems can be used on a daily basis to monitor the workflow of hospital personnel, including nurses, physicians, and custodial staff, and to discipline or reward according to performance. In other words, the biosecuritization modality of the technological imperative leads to the framing of medical progress as the “rationalization” of organizations through technological monitoring, which is intended to promote accountability and new forms of responsibilization of healthcare workers.","Fisher, Jill A.; Monahan, Torin",Soc Sci Med,9,33

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus. While participants who tested positive were more likely to report symptoms than those who did not, over half of participants who tested positive were asymptomatic.","Birger, Ruthie; Morita, Haruka; Comito, Devon; Filip, Ioan; Galanti, Marta; Lane, Benjamin; Ligon, Chanel; Rosenbloom, Daniel; Shittu, Atinuke; Ud-Dean, Minhaz; Desalle, Rob; Planet, Paul; Shaman, Jeffrey",mSphere,9,16

RESULTS: The disease onset was between January 9 to February 14, 2020. Among them, 64 patients are local residents, and 63 patients were back home from Wuhan from January 10 to 24, 2020 before travel restriction. 197 local residents had definite close-contact with 41 pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan. 123 and 74 of them contact with mask-wearing or with no mask-wearing pre-symptomatic patients back from Wuhan, respectively. Data showed that incidence of COVID-19 was significantly higher for local residents close-contact with no mask-wearing Wuhan returned pre-symptomatic patients (19.0% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). Among 57 close-contact individuals, 21 sequential local COVID-19 patients originated from a pre-symptomatic Wuhan returned couple, indicated dense gathering in congested spaces is a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided valuable details of pre-symptomatic patient mask-wearing and restriction of mass gathering in congested spaces particularly, are important interventions to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Hong, Lu-Xiao; Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhao, Hai-Hong; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Chao; Ying, Ling-Jun; Ge, Zheng-Ming; Zhang, Xia; Han, Qiu-Yue; Chen, Qiong-Yuan; Ye, Yao-Han; Zhu, Jian-Sheng; Chen, Hai-Xiao; Yan, Wei-Hua",Travel Med Infect Dis,9,28

An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, “Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?”","Hodgson, Susanne H; Mansatta, Kushal; Mallett, Garry; Harris, Victoria; Emary, Katherine R W; Pollard, Andrew J",Lancet Infect Dis,9,26

Poor access to food often co-occurs with drug use and contributes to associated sequelae, such as risks for HIV and diabetes. The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with adequate food access among PWID in a rural Appalachian community. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were used to collect data among PWID aged 18 and older in Cabell County, West Virginia. Frequency of hunger and sociodemographic, structural and drug use characteristics were measured. Adequate food access was defined as reporting ‘never’ going to bed hungry at night in the past six months. Pearson’s χ(2) and t-tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with food access. RESULTS: Only 71 individuals (17%) reported never going to bed hungry at night in the past six months. Adjusted odds of having adequate food access were higher among PWID who completed high school (aOR 2.94; P = 0.010) and usually used drugs alone (aOR 1.97; P = 0.025), and lower among PWID who were female (aOR 0.51; P = 0.037), experienced homelessness (aOR 0.23, P < 0.001), were recently arrested (aOR 0.50 P = 0.047), and engaged in receptive sharing of injection equipment (aOR 0.52, P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: We found extremely low food access in a population of PWID in Appalachia who are vulnerable to overdose and infectious disease transmission. Integrated interventions promoting food access are needed to improve the public health and wellbeing of people who inject drugs in Appalachia.","Rouhani, Saba; Allen, Sean T.; Whaley, Sara; White, Rebecca Hamilton; O’Rourke, Allison; Schneider, Kristin E.; Kilkenny, Michael E.; Weir, Brian W.; Sherman, Susan G.",Harm Reduct J,9,16

Infection with SARS- CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a disease of variable severity. Mutation has already altered the SARS-CoV-2 genome from its original reported sequence and continued mutation is highly probable. These mutations can: (i) have no significant impact (they are silent), (ii) result in a complete loss or reduction of infectivity, or (iii) induce increase in infectivity. Physical generation, for research purposes, of viral mutations that could enhance infectivity are controversial and highly regulated. The primary purpose of this project was to evaluate the ability of the DeepNEU machine learning stem-cell simulation platform to enable rapid and efficient assessment of the potential impact of viral loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be simulated in human alveolar type lung cells. Simulation of infection in these lung cells can be used to model and assess the impact of LOF and GOF mutations in the SARS-CoV2 genome. We have also created a four- factor infectivity measure: the DeepNEU Case Fatality Rate (dnCFR). dnCFR can be used to assess infectivity based on the presence or absence of the key viral proteins (NSP3, Spike-RDB, N protein, and M protein). dnCFR was used in this study, not to only assess the impact of different mutations on SARS-CoV2 infectivity, but also to categorize the effects of mutations as loss of infectivity or gain of infectivity events.","Esmail, Sally; Danter, Wayne R.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,9,16

Though the epidemic in regions outside Hubei in mainland China has maintained a degree of control, evaluating the effectiveness and timeliness of intervention strategies, and predicting the transmission risk of work resumption as well as lifting the lockdown in Hubei province remain urgent. A patch model reflecting the mobility of population between Hubei and regions outside Hubei is formulated, and parameterized based on multiple source data for Hubei and regions outside Hubei. The effective reproduction numbers for Hubei and regions outside Hubei are estimated as 3.59 and 3.26 before Jan 23rd, 2020, but decrease quickly since then and drop below 1 after Jan 31st and Jan 28th, 2020. It is predicted that the new infections in Hubei province will decrease to very low level in mid-March, and the final size is estimated to be about 68,500 cases. The simulations reveal that contact rate after work resumption or lifting the lockdown in Hubei plays a critical role in affecting the epidemic. If the contact rate could be kept at a relatively low level, work resumption starting as early as on March 2nd in Hubei province may not induce the secondary outbreak, and the daily new infectious cases can be controlled at a low level if the lockdown in Hubei is liftted after March 9th, otherwise both work resumption and lifting the lockdown in Hubei should be postponed.","Sun, Xiaodan; Xiao, Yanni; Ji, Xiangting",J Theor Biol,9,1

Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived levels of heat stress and its consequences in HCWs required to wear PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method: An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCWs required to wear Type 1 or 2 PPE in NHS settings to evaluate the perceived impact of PPE on: (1) physical and cognitive performance; (2) heat stress and heat-related symptoms; (3) frequency of removing PPE due to discomfort caused by heat stress; and (4) general working-life and well-being. Results: The survey received 224 responses from 192 (85.7%) women and 32 (14.3%) men. Even though 71.9% of respondents wore the less thermally challenging PPE (i.e. Type 2), a median of 3 (IQR: 2,5) heat-related symptoms were reported including syncope (7.7%). A median of 1 (IQR: 0-3) cognitive task was adversely affected with attentional focus being the most affected. To relieve discomfort, 32.6% reported removing PPE on five or more occasions in a shift. Ninety two percent reported PPE made their job more difficult and 76.2% advised that physical performance was impaired. Respondents also highlighted concerns of dermatitis and pressure sores in the facial region (22.3%) amongst other factors. Conclusion: Heat stress experienced when PPE is worn negatively impacts the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs and patients. Therefore, modification to current working practices and current design of PPE is urgently required to improve HCWs resilience to pandemics of infectious diseases. Results suggest modifications to the design of the protective face mask and strict enforcement of specific work/rest ratios to limit the duration of PPE use would be immediate impactful interventions.","Davey, S.

Currently, most SARS‐CoV‐2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) clinical testing is voluntary and inconsistently available, except for a few occupational and educational settings, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate accurate population‐level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of limitations and barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community‐level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance to effectively surveil communities. However, epidemiologically defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Herein, we describe methods for developing a geographically resolved population‐level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and present preliminary results. Utilizing this site selection protocol, samples (n = 237) were collected from 17 wastewater catchment areas, September 8 to October 30, 2020 from one to four times per week in each area and compared to concurrent clinical data aggregated to wastewater catchment areas and county level. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was consistently present in wastewater during the studied period, and varied by area. Data obtained using the site selection protocol showed variation in geographically resolved wastewater SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA concentration compared to clinical rates. These findings highlight the importance of neighborhood‐equivalent spatial scales and provide a promising approach for viral epidemic surveillance, thus better guiding spatially targeted public health mitigation strategies.","Yeager, R.; Holm, R.

HRV infections usually lead to more severe and longer duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms in asthmatics than in otherwise healthy individuals. However, the exact mechanism by which viruses contribute to exacerbation of asthma is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study was to investigate the relationship of the enhanced severity of LRT symptoms to viral dynamics or cytokine responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT). STUDY DESIGN: Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study in which asthmatics and healthy controls were followed during natural viral respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Our study confirmed that viral respiratory tract infections caused more severe problems of the LRT in asthma patients as compared to healthy controls. However, for all subjects, the severity of LRT symptoms were not related to viral load or prolonged viral shedding in the URT. In addition, we did not detect differences in proinflammatory cytokines in the URT between asthmatics and controls.

Among the bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that can be sexually transmitted, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has caused one of the most important pandemic diseases, which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 32.7 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic. Moreover, in 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide. The need to deal with this viral infection becomes more obvious, because it represents not only a problem for public health, but also a substantial economic problem. In this context, it is necessary to focus efforts on developing methods for prevention, detection and treatment of HIV infections that significantly reduce the number of newly infected people and provide a better quality of life for patients. For several decades, biomedical research has been developed allowing quick solutions through the contribution of effective tools. One of them is the use of polymers as vehicles, drug carrier agents, or as macromolecular prodrugs. Moreover, nanosystems (NSs) play an especially important role in the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy against HIV infection. The purpose of this work is to review recent research into diverse NSs as potential candidates for prevention and treatment of HIV infection. Firstly, this review highlights the advantages of using nanosized structures for these medical applications. Furthermore, we provide an overview of different types of NSs used for preventing or combating HIV infection.

METHODS: The e-GLILDnet collaborators developed and conducted an online survey facilitated by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) between February–April 2020. Results were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-one responses from adult and pediatric pulmonologists and immunologists from 47 countries were analyzed. Respondents treated a median of 27 (interquartile range, IQR 82–maximum 500) CVID patients, of which a median of 5 (IQR 8–max 200) had GLILD. Most respondents experienced difficulties in establishing the diagnosis of GLILD and only 31 (19%) had access to a standardized protocol.

We performed an infodemiology study of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Twitter conversation related to anesthesiology to describe how Twitter has been used during the pandemic and ways to optimize Twitter use by anesthesiologists. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of tweets related to the specialty of anesthesiology and COVID-19 tweeted between January 21 and October 13, 2020. A publicly available COVID-19 Twitter dataset was filtered for tweets meeting inclusion criteria (tweets including anesthesiology keywords). Using descriptive statistics, tweets were reviewed for tweet and account characteristics. Tweets were filtered for specific topics of interest likely to be impactful or informative to anesthesiologists of COVID-19 practice (airway management, personal protective equipment, ventilators, COVID testing, and pain management). Tweet activity was also summarized descriptively to show temporal profiles over the pandemic. RESULTS 23,270 of 241,732,881 tweets (0.01%) met inclusion criteria between January 21 to October 13, 2020 and were generated by 15,770 accounts. The majority (51.9%) of accounts were from the United States (US). 749 (4.8%) of all users self-reported as anesthesiologists. 33.8% of all tweets included at least one hashtag, with the most frequently used anesthesia hashtag being #anesthesia. 52.2% of all tweets included at least one hyperlink, and the most frequently linked websites were other social media, news organizations, medical organizations, or scientific publications. The majority of tweets (67%) were not retweeted. COVID-19 anesthesia tweet activity started before the pandemic was declared. The trend of daily tweet activity was similar to, and preceded, the US daily death count by about 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS The toll of the pandemic has been reflected in the anesthesiology conversation on Twitter, representing 0.01% of all COVID-19 tweets. Daily tweet activity showed how the Twitter community used the platform to learn about important topics impacting anesthesiology practice during a global pandemic. Twitter is a relevant medium through which to communicate anesthesiology topics, but further research is required to delineate this platform's effectiveness, benefits, and limitations for anesthesiology discussions.","Gai, Nan; So, Delvin; Siddiqui, Asad; Steinberg, Benjamin E",Anesthesia and analgesia,9,1

Traditionally, CME is delivered face-to-face, but due to geographical distances, and pressure of work in Bangladesh, general practitioners (GPs) are unable to relocate for several days to attend training. Using chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an exemplar, we aimed to assess the feasibility of blended learning (combination of face-to-face and online) for GPs, and explore trainees’ and trainers’ perspectives towards the blended learning approach. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods design. We trained 49 GPs in two groups via blended (n = 25) and traditional face-to-face approach (n = 24) and assessed their post-course knowledge and skills. The COPD Physician Practice Assessment Questionnaire (COPD-PPAQ) was administered before and one-month post-course. Verbatim transcriptions of focus group discussions with 18 course attendees and interviews with three course trainers were translated into English and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Forty GPs completed the course (Blended: 19; Traditional: 21). The knowledge and skills post course, and the improvement in self-reported adherence to COPD guidelines was similar in both groups. Most participants preferred blended learning as it was more convenient than taking time out of their busy work life, and for many the online learning optimised the benefits of the subsequent face-to-face sessions. Suggested improvements included online interactivity with tutors, improved user friendliness of the e-learning platform, and timing face-to-face classes over weekends to avoid time-out of practice. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement requires a multifaceted approach, but adequate knowledge and skills are core components. Blended learning is feasible and, with a few caveats, is an acceptable option to GPs in Bangladesh. This is timely, given that online learning with limited face-to-face contact is likely to become the norm in the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.","Uzzaman, Md.
