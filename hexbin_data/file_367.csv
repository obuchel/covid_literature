2674,2674,2674,A review of Phase I trials of Ebola virus vaccines: what can we learn from the race to develop novel vaccines?,22.807547,7.13597,2017-05-26,"Sporadic outbreaks of Ebola virus infection have been documented since the mid-Seventies and viral exposure can lead to lethal haemorrhagic fever with case fatalities as high as 90%. There is now a comprehensive body of data from both ongoing and completed clinical trials assessing various vaccine strategies, which were rapidly advanced through clinical trials in response to the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) public health emergency. Careful consideration of immunogenicity post vaccination is essential but has been somewhat stifled because of the wide array of immunological assays and outputs that have been used in the numerous clinical trials. We discuss here the different aspects of the immune assays currently used in the Phase I clinical trials for Ebola virus vaccines, and draw comparisons across the immune outputs where possible; various trials have examined both cellular and humoral immunity in European and African cohorts. Assessment of the safety data, the immunological outputs and the ease of field deployment for the various vaccine modalities will help both the scientific community and policy-makers prioritize and potentially license vaccine candidates. If this can be achieved, the next outbreak of Ebola virus, or other emerging pathogen, can be more readily contained and will not have such widespread and devastating consequences. This article is part of the themed issue ‘The 2013–2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control’.","Lambe, Teresa; Bowyer, Georgina; Ewer, Katie J",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,367,28

The attentional capture paradigm is regularly used to study conditions of attentional control. It has up to now not been used to assess influences of sudden onset distractor stimuli in MOT. We investigated whether attentional capture does occur in MOT: Are onset distractors processed at all in dynamic attentional tasks? We found that sudden onset distractors were effective in lowering probe detection, thus demonstrating attentional capture. Tracking performance as dependent measure was not affected. The attentional capture effect persisted in conditions of higher tracking load (Experiment 2) and was dramatically increased in lower presentation frequency of the onset distractor (Experiment 3). Tracking performance was shown to suffer only when onset distractors were presented serially with very short time gaps in between, thus effectively disturbing re-engaging attention on the tracking set (Experiment 4). We discuss that rapid dis- and re-engagement of the attention process on target objects and an additional more basic process that continuously provides location information allow managing strong disruptions of attention during tracking.","Pichlmeier, Sebastian; Pfeiffer, Till",J Vis,367,1

Therefore, epidemiological surveillance is critical for monitoring their circulation pattern. Trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine formulations are available in Panama (until and since 2016, respectively). Herein, we analysed influenza A and B epidemiological patterns in Panama. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive analysis of all laboratory-confirmed influenza nasopharyngeal samples recorded between 2011 and 2017 in the nationwide surveillance database of Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies. The analysis involved data relative to demographic information, virus type, subtype and lineage, geographic region, treatment and outcomes. The percentage level of mismatch between circulating and vaccine-recommended B lineage was assessed for each May–October influenza season. RESULTS: Among 1839 influenza cases, 79.6% were type A and 20.4% were type B. Most of them were observed in Panama City (54.7%) followed by the West (23.2%) and Central (16.7%) regions; across all regions, influenza A and B cases were distributed in a 4:1 ratio. Overall, approximately half were hospitalized (52.0% for type A; 45.5% for type B) and 11 (0.6%) died. Treatment, usually antimicrobial, was administered in 15.1% of cases. Children less than 2 years old were the most affected by this disease. Influenza type A circulated every year, while influenza B only circulated in 2012, 2014 and 2017. In the 2012 May–October influenza B season, the predominant lineage was B/Victoria and a switch to B/Yamagata was observed in 2014. Both lineages co-circulated in 2017, leading to a 38.9% B-lineage-level vaccine mismatch. CONCLUSION: Influenza A was predominant among all ages and children less than 2 years and inhabitants of Panama City reported the highest circulation rate. In 2017, co-circulation of both B lineages led to a vaccine mismatch. Continuous monitoring of seasonal influenza is critical to establish immunization recommendations.

This study has conducted surveys of various tools, techniques, frameworks, and models useful for blended learning. This article has prepared a comprehensive survey of student, teacher, and management experiences in blended learning courses during COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 times. The survey will be useful to faculty members, students, and management to adopt new tools and mindsets for positive outcomes. This work reports on implementing and assessing blended learning at two different universities (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, India, and Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India). The assessments prepare the benefits and challenges of learning (by students) and teaching (by faculty) blended learning courses with different online learning tools. Additionally, student performance in the traditional and blended learning courses was compared to list the concerns about effectively shifting the face-to-face courses to a blended learning model in emergencies like COVID-19. As a result, it has been observed that blended learning is helpful for school, university, and professional training. A large set of online and e-learning platforms are developed in recent times that can be used in blended learning to improve the learner's abilities. The use of similar tools (Blackboard, CodeTantra, and g suite) has fulfilled the requirements of the two universities, and timely conducted and completed all academic activities during pandemic times.","Kumar, A.; Krishnamurthi, R.; Bhatia, S.; Kaushik, K.; Ahuja, N.

With limited healthcare and challenging living conditions, people living in poverty may be particularly susceptible to endemic and emerging diseases. Similarly, wildlife is impacted by human influences, including pathogen sharing, especially for species in close contact with people and domesticated animals. Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants’ health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animals for 1) network of contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, 2) network of contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels (maximum of seven symptoms in one day), with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. Besides human-human contacts, direct contacts with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. Wildlife contacts were the rarest, including one direct contact with gorilla with a concerning timeline of reported symptoms. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealing a preference in contacts within the same species or taxon and within their groups. Despite sightings of wildlife being much more common than touching, one participant declared direct contact with a mountain gorilla during the week. Gorillas were seen very close to six animal taxa (including themselves) considering all interaction types, mostly seen closer to other gorillas, but also people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions.","Muylaert, Renata L.; Davidson, Ben; Ngabirano, Alex; Kalema-Zikusoka, Gladys; MacGregor, Hayley; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Fayaz, Ahmed; Knox, Matthew A.; Hayman, David T.

First, we discuss about recent psychological and neuronal findings on fear and its disorders, related to an unbalanced intero-exteroceptive processing and emotional regulation. Secondly we move to the psychological and neuronal dynamics of self and others characterized by a temporo-spatial alignment with the world. Due to the neural overlap of emotion and self and the deep-reaching neuro-ecological layers of self, emotional feelings like fear and anxiety cannot be detached and dissociated from the world; they signify the world–brain relation, and, more specifically, our self-other relation. The deepest neuro-ecological and neuro-social layers of self are threatened by the loss of subjectivity, which is manifest in our loss of body and thus the fear of dying, and the loss of intersubjectivity that surfaces in our fear of infecting others, which reflect the intimate anchorage of the self with the world. In our opinion the pandemic of COVID-19 deeply affect our sense of self and its spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics providing the prerequisites for the manifestation of fear and existential anxiety, thus disrupting the brain-world relation with significant repercussions on our psyche and on our daily lives.","Scalabrini, Andrea; Mucci, Clara; Angeletti, Lorenzo Lucherini; Northoff, Georg",Clin.

Statistical differences were observed between the groups of women in early and late pregnancy with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS.­: No major complications were reported among the studied cohort, though 1 serious case and 1 perinatal infection were observed. Much effort should be made to reduce the pathogenic effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnancies.","Yang, Hui; Hu, Bin; Zhan, Sudong; Yang, Li-Ye; Xiong, Guoping",Arch Pathol Lab Med,367,16

To assist SD monitoring, several tech companies have made publicly available anonymized mobility data. In this work, we conduct a multi-objective mobility reduction rate comparison between the first and second COVID-19 waves in several localities from America and Europe using Google community mobility reports~(CMR) data. Through multi-dimensional visualization, we are able to compare in a Pareto-compliant way the reduction in mobility from the different lockdown periods for each locality selected, simultaneously considering all place categories provided in CMR. In addition, our analysis comprises a 56-day lockdown period for each locality and COVID-19 wave, which we analyze both as 56-day periods and as 14-day consecutive windows. Results vary considerably as a function of the locality considered, particularly when the temporal evolution of the mobility reduction is considered. We thus discuss each locality individually, relating social distancing measures and the reduction observed.","Silva, Gabriela Cavalcante da; Almeida, Fernanda Monteiro de; Oliveira, Sabrina; Bezerra, Leonardo C.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HE, and hand hygiene practices in HCWs working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. METHODS: A total of 244 HCWs working in COVID-19 (n = 118) and non-COVID-19 patient care units (n = 126) were examined by dermatologists with regard to demographic parameters and hand hygiene practices. The COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to age, atopy, and generalized dry skin. RESULTS: HE was more frequent in the COVID-19 group (48.3% vs 12.7%, P < .001), whereas working years (P < .05) and additional housework at home (P < .001) were longer in the non-COVID-19 group. After the development of HE, moisturizing creams were reported to be more frequently used in the COVID group (P < .001).

At the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value ââa vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on the preexistence of chronic disease (p&#8804;0.05), knowledge of COVID-19 (p&#8804;0.05), being sick with COVID-19 (p&#8804;0.05), perception of government performance (p&#8804;0.01), employment status (p&#8804;0.01), income (p&#8804;0.01), health care (p&#8804;0.05), adaptation to quarantine with children at home (p&#8804;0.01) and whether the person has recovered from COVID-19 (p&#8804;0.10). According to our discrete choice model in double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals' WTP is US$184.72 (CI: 165.52-203.92; p < 0.01). This implies a social valuation of approximately US$2232 million, corresponding to 1.09% of the GNP per capita.","García, Leidy Y; Cerda, Arcadio A",Vaccine,367,18

422994,422994,422994,Modelling that shaped the early COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK,22.799847,6.9175205,2021,"Background: Among a multitude of factors contributing to the current COVID-19 pandemic is a high known rate of human-to-human transmission. This effect is magnified in hospitals by the high-risk environment when treating COVID-19 patients. Healthcare systems have attempted to address exposure risk with infection control policies with unknown benefit. Yet few reports describe hospital-acquired COVID-19 (HAC). Examining a select few cases could give insight into the incidence, mechanism, and diagnosis of HAC. Methods: Bulk EHR data was acquired for all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution from 03/01/2020 to 06/01/2020. Data were analyzed using R v4.0.0 and RStudio v1.2.5042. Positive tests with high probability of nosocomial infections were identified as patients with two initial negative COVID-19 tests who then tested COVID-19 positive no sooner than 48 hours after the initial negative test result along with a documented change in clinical status. Patient charts were then reviewed to examine possible etiologies of nosocomial infection in context of infection control policies. Demographics, hospital stay data, and outcomes were also reviewed. Results: Nine patients were identified on initial data extraction with high likelihood of HAC. Four of nine after chart review had a significant documented clinical change confirming HAC. Six of nine patients (66%) expired during their hospital stay. Five of the six patients became positive on the same unit and floor (non-COVID), with three of these patients during a four-day timespan. Chart review revealed flaws in patient and provider cohorting, PPE allocation, and COVID-19 testing resources. Discussion: The goal of this project was to identify a subset of patients with HAC and systematically map points of failure throughout the hospital course. Key points of failure in the identified patients include lapses in cohorting (no Person Under Investigation stratification, lack of resources to support proper cohorting) and lack of COVID-19 care provider cohorting (ED and ICU personnel treating all categories of patients). Decreased access to PPE also coincided with nosocomial infection in certain units. Limited COVID-19 testing and retesting could have increased exposure. Reviewing database testing and chart review, three parameters were found to have good value for selecting patients with HAC: an initial negative test, a positive test after set number of days, and an associated change in clinical status during the time period of new positive test result. Further studies should be done to determine the criteria with the best characteristics to identify HAC.","Vatson, J. S.; Nahass, T.

Information about the different alcohol use patterns and their correlates among university students in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and cardinal demographic and psychosocial factors associated with specific alcohol use patterns among Ugandan university students. Methods: a cross section study conducted over 5-months among university students using a standardized socio-demographic questionnaire screened for alcohol use problems, depression symptoms and academic stress using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20) and the higher education stress inventory (HESI) respectively. Multivariate multinomial regression models were used to determine factors independently associated with a specific alcohol use pattern with low-risk drinkers as the reference group. Results: a thousand out of 1200 students completed all study requirements for which 60% were males; median age was 22.3 (SD=2.36). The prevalence estimates of any alcohol use, low-risk drinking, heavy episodic drinking and alcohol misuse were 31%, 17.3%, 4.5% and 8.9% respectively. In comparison to low-risk drinkers, students reporting heavy episodic drinking were more likely to report high levels of academic stress (P-value <0.10). Those with alcohol misuse were more likely to be males and with significant depression symptoms (P-value &#8804;0.05). Non-alcohol users were more likely to report high levels of academic stress (P-value &#8804;0.05). Conclusion: the prevalence of maladaptive alcohol use patterns is high among Ugandan university students.

Therefore, identification of new therapeutic strategies seems essential either based on novel vaccines or drugs or simply repurposing existing drugs. Notably, due to their known safety profile, repurposing of existing drugs is the fastest and highly efficient approach to bring a therapeutic to a clinic for any new indication. One such drug that has been used extensively for decades is chloroquine (CQ, with its derivatives) either for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Accumulating body of evidence from experimental pharmacology suggests that CQ and related analogues also activate certain pathways that can potentially be exploited for therapeutic gain. For example, in the airways, this has opened an attractive avenue for developing novel bitter taste ligands as a new class of bronchodilators for asthma. While CQ and its derivatives have been proposed as a therapy in COVID-19, it remains to be seen whether it really work in the clinic? To this end, our perspective aims to provide a timely yet brief insights on the existing literature on CQ and the controversies surrounding its use in COVID-19. Further, we also highlight some of cell-based mechanism(s) that CQ and its derivatives affect in mediating variety of physiological responses in the cell. We believe, data emanating from the clinical studies and continual understanding of the fundamental mechanisms may potentially help in designing effective therapeutic strategies that meets both efficacy and safety criteria for COVID-19.","Sharma, Pawan; McAlinden, Kielan D; Ghavami, Saeid; Deshpande, Deepak A",Eur J Pharmacol,367,20

The proposed biofuel cell works by an enzymatic reaction with glucose in sweat absorbed by the specially designed textile for sustainable and efficient energy harvesting. The output power of the textile-based biofuel cell has been optimized by changing electrode size and stacking electrodes and corresponding fluidic channels suitable for following power management circuit. The output power level of single electrode is estimated less than 0.5 µW and thus a two-staged power management circuit using intermediate supercapacitor has been presented. As a solution to produce a higher power level, multiple stacks of biofuel cell electrodes have been proposed and thus the textile-based biofuel cell employing serially connected 5 stacks produces a maximal power of 13 µW with an output voltage of 0.88 V when load resistance is 40 k&#937;. A buck-boost converter employing a crystal oscillator directly triggered by DC output voltage of the biofuel cell makes it possible to obtain output voltage of the DC-DC converter is 6.75 V. The efficiency of the DC-DC converter is estimated as approximately 50% when the output power of the biofuel cell is tens microwatts. In addition, LT-spice modeling and simulation has been presented to estimate power consumption of each element of the proposed DC-DC converter circuit and the predicted output voltage has good agreement with measurement result.","Seok, Seonho; Wang, Cong; Lefeuvre, Elie; Park, Jungyul",,367,12

Many anatomists believe that the new adaptations may hinder student-student (66.7%) and student-tutor (45.8%) interactions. Regarding assessment, 52.6% of academics preferred traditional methods to online. Remote online assessment was difficult to protect against collusion, but provided time saving opportunities for academics. Finally, in terms of working environment, 83.3% of academics stated that their workload increased; 54.2% preferred working on site rather than remotely and 79.2% think that staff interactions are better when working on site. These results demonstrate a widespread concern amongst anatomists regarding the pandemic-induced adaptations to teaching, assessment and working environment. However, important opportunities were also identified that could ultimately serve to benefit students and educators alike.","Dulohery, Kate; Scully, Deirdre; Longhurst, Georga J; Stone, Danya M; Campbell, Thomas",Clin. anat,367,20

Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps. Three constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of these models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough vector fields. The third is the Euler--Poincar\'e formulation in which the variations are constrained. These variational principles lead directly to the Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics obtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian variational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin circulation theorem. The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the Lagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the stochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this property.","Crisan, Dan; Holm, Darryl D.; Leahy, James-Michael; Nilssen, Torstein",,367,24

Such diseases spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected, and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an infected user by turning on the app during active times.","Hekmati, Arvin; Ramachandran, Gowri; Krishnamachari, Bhaskar",,367,32

METHODS: The technology utilizes fluorogenic oligonucleotide signaling probes and flow cytometry to detect and isolate individual living cells expressing one or more transfected or endogenously-expressed genes. RESULTS: Results for production of cell lines expressing a diversity of ion channel and membrane proteins are presented, including heteromultimeric epithelial sodium channel (αβγ-ENaC), sodium voltage-gated ion channel 1.7 (NaV1.7-αβ1β2), four unique γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor ion channel subunit combinations α1β3γ2s, α2β3γ2s, α3β3γ2s and α5β3γ2s, cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR), CFTR-Δ508 and two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) without reliance on leader sequences and/or chaperones. In addition, three novel plasmid-encoded sequences used to introduce 3′ untranslated RNA sequence tags in mRNA expression products and differentially-detectable fluorogenic probes directed to each are described. The tags and corresponding fluorogenic signaling probes streamline the process by enabling the multiplexed detection and isolation of cells expressing one or more genes without the need for gene-specific probes.

In this study, an updated literature review was carried out regarding neurological disorders in COVID-19. Neurological symptoms are more common in patients with severe infection according to their respiratory status and divided into three categories: (1) CNS manifestations; (2) cranial and peripheral nervous system manifestations; and (3) skeletal muscle injury manifestations. Patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease are at a higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 are of great importance, but when life-threatening abnormal vital signs occur in severely ill COVID-19 patients, neurological problems are usually not considered. It is crucial to search for new treatments for brain damage, as well as for alternative therapies that recover the damaged brain and reduce the inflammatory response and its consequences for other organs. In addition, there is a need to diagnose these manifestations as early as possible to limit long-term consequences. Therefore, much research is needed to explain the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 causing these neurological symptoms because scientists know zero about it.","Majolo, Fernanda; da Silva, Guilherme Liberato; Vieira, Lucas; Anli, Cetin; Timmers, Luís Fernando Saraiva Macedo; Laufer, Stefan; Goettert, Márcia Inês",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),367,30

Participants self-reported pre- and post-COVID-19 levels of moderate and vigorous PA, sitting, and screen time. Currently-followed public health guidelines, stress, loneliness, positive mental health (PMH), social connectedness, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were self-reported. Participants were grouped by meeting US PA guidelines, reporting ≥8 h/day of sitting, or ≥8 h/day of screen time, pre- and post-COVID-19. Overall, 62% of participants were female, with age ranging from 18–24 (16.6% of sample) to 75+ (9.3%).

Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact the public's interpretation of risk messages and subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat. The media's framing of an outbreak is important, as it may affect both perception of risk and the ability to process important health information. METHODS: To understand how risk communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was framed and delivered and to what extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC's framing and authoritative voice, 209 CDC communications and primetime broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were analyzed and coded by thematic frame and authoritative voice. Dominant frame and voice were determined for each month and for overall period of analysis. RESULTS: Medical frame was dominant in CDC (60%), Anderson Cooper 360 (49%), The Rachel Maddow Show (47%) and All In with Chris Hayes (47%). The human interest frame was dominant in The Kelly File (45%), while The O'Reilly Factor coverage was equally split between sociopolitical and medical frames (28%, respectively). Primetime news media also changed dominant frames over time. Dominant authoritative voice in CDC communications was that of CDC officials, while primetime news dominantly featured local and federal (non-CDC) government officials and academic/medical experts. CONCLUSION: Differences in framing and delivery could have led the public to interpret risk in a different way than intended by CDC. Overall, public health agencies should consider adapting risk communication strategies to account for a dynamic news environment and the media's agenda. Options include adapting communications to short-form styles and embracing the concept of storytelling.","Kott, Anne; Limaye, Rupali J.",Soc Sci Med,367,1

Mechanical ventilation remains the cornerstone of supportive therapy for ARDS. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation minimizes the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improves survival. Several parameters are determinants of VILI and require careful setting, such as tidal volume (VT), plateau pressure (Pplat), driving pressure (DP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate. Furthermore, measurement of energy and mechanical power may enable quantification of the relative contribution of its different components (VT, Pplat, ΔP, PEEP, respiratory rate, and airflow) and better individualize mechanical ventilation settings. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents is of interest, mainly in cases of severe ARDS, to improve oxygenation and reduce asynchrony; however, no significant changes in survival have been observed. Rescue respiratory therapies, such as prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal support techniques may also be used in specific situations.

Over the last 18 years, we performed 11 436 KT, 70% of which from deceased donors. To mitigate the effects of reduction in the number of transplants on the waiting list, sequential measures were implemented when COVID‐19 was declared pandemic. METHODS: The first step was to provide SARS‐COV‐2 RT‐PCR testing for all symptomatic employees and patients and the compulsory use of personal protective equipment in the hospital facilities. Living donor KT were postponed, and all deceased donors and recipients were tested before the transplantation. The immunosuppressive protocols were maintained, and telehealth strategies were developed. RESULTS: Among the 1013 employees, there were 214 cases of COVID‐19, nine required ward hospitalization, and no deaths occurred. In 26%, the probable source of contamination was occupational. From the first patient diagnosed with COVID‐19 in 03/20/2020 till 10/21/2020, 523 deceased KT were performed, a 21% increase compared with 2019, with no confirmed donor‐derived SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Four patients were transplanted with a positive pretransplant SARS‐CoV‐2 test, but none of them developed the disease. Overall, of 11 875 KT followed in our center, 674 developed COVID‐19. Among the hospitalized, 53% required mechanical ventilation, and 45% required hemodialysis. Their overall mortality rate was 27.5%.

For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID. METHODS: From CORD‐19, we identified full‐text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency–inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K‐means clustering. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty‐nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. CONCLUSION: The CORD‐19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID‐19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them.

It places recent research in the perspective of the history of empirical research on sexuality, particularly in relation to research carried out in the context of HIV/AIDS. Situated in an intellectual history perspective, the article analyzes research currently being developed as the construction and prefiguration of a new paradigm of sexualities that distinguishes and associates sexual relations that take place in the presence of a real partner and those that take place with the help of a whole range of electronic devices qualified as “virtual” that provide support for the imagination and maintain sexual arousal for personal satisfaction.","Giami, A.",,367,28

Information was collected by Healthcare structures (HS) on paper forms and transferred to the central level by post or email. Completeness of data reporting was around 20% in 2009–10. From 2011, in two southern regions data were transmitted through short messages service using one telephone provider. We evaluated the system in 2014–15 to determine its performance before changing or expanding it. METHODS: We randomly selected 80 HS and interviewed their representatives face-to-face (42) or by telephone (38). We evaluated knowledge of surveillance activities and selected case definitions, number of SMS with erroneous or missing information among the last ten transferred SMS, proportion of weekly reports received in the last 4 weeks and of the last four health alerts notified within 48 h, as well as mobile phone network coverage. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of 80 interviewed HS representatives didn’t know their terms of reference, 83% were familiar with the malaria case definition and 32% with that of dengue. Ninety percent (37/41) of visited HS had five or more errors and 47% had missing data in the last ten SMS they transferred. The average time needed for weekly IDSR data compilation was 24 min in the Southern and 47 in the South-eastern region. Of 320 expected SMS 232 (73%) were received, 136 (43%) of them in time. Out of 38 alerts detected, four were notified on time. Nine percent (7/80) of HS had no telephone network with the current provider. CONCLUSIONS: SMS transfer has improved IDSR data completeness, but timeliness and data quality remain a problem. Healthcare staff needs training on guidelines and case definitions. From 2016, data are collected and managed electronically to reduce errors and improve the system’s performance.","Randriamiarana, Rado; Raminosoa, Grégoire; Vonjitsara, Nikaria; Randrianasolo, Rivo; Rasamoelina, Harena; Razafimandimby, Harimahefa; Rakotonjanabelo, Arthur Lamina; Lepec, Richard; Flachet, Loïc; Halm, Ariane",BMC Health Serv Res,367,11

Novel findings from a compound Poisson generalized linear modeling approach,23.210222,6.791437,2020-10-28,"INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors such as wind, temperature, humidity, and sun exposure are known to affect influenza and viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions. COVID-19 is a new pandemic with very little information available about its transmission and association with environmental factors. The goal of this paper is to explore the association of environmental factors on daily incidence rate, mortality rate, and recoveries of COVID-19. METHODS: The environmental data for humidity, temperature, wind, and sun exposure were recorded from metrological websites and COVID-19 data such as the daily incidence rate, death rate, and daily recovery were extracted from the government's official website available to the general public. The analysis for each outcome was adjusted for factors such as lock down status, nationwide events, and the number of daily tests performed. Analysis was completed with negative binominal regression log link using generalised linear modelling. RESULTS: Daily temperature, sun exposure, wind, and humidity were not significantly associated with daily incidence rate. Temperature and nationwide social gatherings, although non-significant, showed trends towards a higher chance of incidence. An increase in the number of daily testing was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 incidences (effect size ranged from 2.17–9.96). No factors were significantly associated with daily death rates. Except for the province of Balochistan, a lower daily temperature was associated with a significantly higher daily recovery rate. DISCUSSION: Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and daily sun exposure were not consistently associated with COVID-19 incidence, death rates, or recovery. More policing about precautionary measures and ensuring diagnostic testing and accuracy are needed.","Rehman, Yasir; Rehman, Nadia",AIMS Public Health,367,20

A regional analysis in China,23.299726,7.061625,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global health crisis. CT chest is considered as an important investigation for early diagnosis as well as assessment of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Several articles reported that there is a correlation between ABO blood group system and susceptibility as well as prognosis of the disease. In our study we correlated the CT severity score (CT-SS) and the ABO blood group in patients with COVID-19 infection. This study involved 547 symptomatic patients with pathologically proven COVID-19 infection (positive PCR); non contrast CT chest was done for all cases and CT severity score (CT-SS) was calculated followed by its correlation with the patients’ ABO blood group. Aim of the work was to evaluate the relation between CT-SS and the ABO blood groups in Egyptian patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The mean CT-SS in patients with blood group A patients (n = 153; 28%) was 13.7 (moderate severity), while in patients with blood group O (n = 227; 41.5%) the mean CT-SS was 6.7 (mild severity). In blood group B patients (n = 139; 25.4%) the mean CT-SS was 9.1 (mild to moderate severity) and in blood group AB patients (n = 28; 5.1%) the mean CT-SS was 9.7 (mild to moderate severity). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with blood group A are more prone to aggressive CT findings (higher CT-SS) and consequently may be susceptible to increased risk of mortality compared to the patients with other blood groups; however, patients with blood group O are suggested to have the least CT-SS and appear to be relatively protected.","Mansour, Mohamed G.; Abdelrahman, Ahmed S.; Abdeldayem, Emad H.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,367,21

Against the background of the new coronavirus pneumonia, through the analysis and research of the current situation of domestic and foreign e-commerce logistics, optimize the cross-border e-commerce logistics distribution model, establish an environmental model, and use efficient search algorithms to search for walking paths that meet environmental requirements. Based on the Dijkstra algorithm model of demand, and based on the linear relationship between demand and delivery distance, an optimal route selection model is established to select the optimal route with the shortest total travel distance. The simulation results show that the cross-border e-commerce transportation time of this model is within 13 h, which is shorter than that of the traditional model. The search efficiency of the optimal route for cross-border e-commerce transportation is higher, and the time for cross-border e-commerce transportation is shorter.","Abudureheman, Abuduaini; Nilupaer, Aishanjiang",Soft comput,367,21

In this paper we develop a dynamic model of debt runs based on He and Xiong (2012) to identify, both conceptually and quantitatively, the value of a liquidity backstop for its run-mitigating role. For the purpose of identification, we focus on the municipal bond markets for variable rate demand obligations and auction rate securities. Based on the run episodes in these markets during the financial crisis of 2007-09 and the calibrated model, we find that the value of a liquidity backstop is about 14.5 basis points per annum.

Music is a common parent-child activity and has been found to positively impact relationships, but little is known about music’s role in parent-child interactions during a pandemic. The current study utilized an online questionnaire to assess the use of music in the home of young children and their parents in the United States and Canada during Covid-19 and its relationship with parents’ affective attachment with their child. Musical activity was high for both parents and children. Parents reported using music for both emotion regulation and to socially connect with their children. Parent-child musical engagement was associated with parent-child attachment, controlling for relevant parent variables including parent distress, efficacy, education, and parent-child engagement in non-musical activities. These results indicate that music may be an effective tool for building and maintaining parent-child relationships during a period of uncertainty and change.","Steinberg, Selena; Liu, Talia; Lense, Miriam D.",Front Psychol,367,8

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model, presented as a nomogram and scale, to identify infectious acute abdomen patients with suspected COVID-19 more effectively and efficiently. Methods: A total of 584 COVID-19 patients and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients were enrolled. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to develop the prediction model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated through calibration curves, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves in the training and validation cohorts. A simplified screening scale and a management algorithm were generated based on the nomogram. Results: Five potential COVID-19 prediction variables, fever, chest CT, WBC, CRP, and PCT, were selected, all independent predictors of multivariable logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram, named the COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration, and it was validated in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified as the CIAAD scale. Conclusion: We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in the emergency department to use to distinguish COVID-19 patients. The algorithm based on the CIAAD scale will help surgeons more efficiently manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected of having COVID-19.","Zhao, Bangbo; Wei, Yingxin; Sun, Wenwu; Qin, Cheng; Zhou, Xingtong; Wang, Zihao; Li, Tianhao; Cao, Hongtao; Wang, Yujun; Wang, Weibin",Front Med (Lausanne),367,27

Currently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools. 5,5-Methylenedisalicylic acid is a novel scaffold previously identified by virtual screening with detectable although weak inhibitory activity of DNMT1 in biochemical assays. Herein, we report enzyme inhibition of a structurally related compound, trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid (NSC97317) that showed a low micromolar inhibition of DNMT1 (IC(50) = 4.79 μM). Docking studies of the new inhibitor with the catalytic domain of DNMT1 suggest that NSC97317 can bind into the catalytic site. Interactions with amino acid residues that participate in the mechanism of DNA methylation contribute to the binding recognition. In addition, NSC97317 had a good match with a structure-based pharmacophore model recently developed for inhibitors of DNMT1. Trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid can be a valuable biochemical tool to study DNMT1 inhibition in cancer and other diseases related to DNA methylation.

Unfortunately, similar problems exist for other betacoronaviruses, and no vouchered specimens exist to corroborate host species identification for most of these pathogens. This most basic information is critical to the full understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonotic diseases. To overcome this hurdle, we recommend that host-pathogen researchers adopt vouchering practices and collaborate with natural history collections to permanently archive microbiological samples and host specimens. Vouchered specimens and associated samples provide both repeatability and extension to host-pathogen studies, and using them mobilizes a large workforce (i.e., biodiversity scientists) to assist in pandemic preparedness. We review several well-known examples that successfully integrate host-pathogen research with natural history collections (e.g., yellow fever, hantaviruses, helminths). However, vouchering remains an underutilized practice in such studies. Using an online survey, we assessed vouchering practices used by microbiologists (e.g., bacteriologists, parasitologists, virologists) in host-pathogen research. A much greater number of respondents permanently archive microbiological samples than archive host specimens, and less than half of respondents voucher host specimens from which microbiological samples were lethally collected. To foster collaborations between microbiologists and natural history collections, we provide recommendations for integrating vouchering techniques and archiving of microbiological samples into host-pathogen studies. This integrative approach exemplifies the premise underlying One Health initiatives, providing critical infrastructure for addressing related issues ranging from public health to global climate change and the biodiversity crisis.","Thompson, Cody W.; Phelps, Kendra L.; Allard, Marc W.; Cook, Joseph A.; Dunnum, Jonathan L.; Ferguson, Adam W.; Gelang, Magnus; Khan, Faisal Ali Anwarali; Paul, Deborah L.; Reeder, DeeAnn M.; Simmons, Nancy B.; Vanhove, Maarten P.

It reports perceptions of drinking and smoking from a three-phased study of the stigma associated with TB, consisting of a qualitative pilot study using focus-group discussions (2006), a larger-scale community survey (2007), and follow-up group discussions (2009). The community attitude survey was conducted with a sample of 1,020 adults living in a low-income township in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The study found that the moral and the biomedical understanding of TB risk are intertwined. In the community survey, perceptions of drinking and smoking as TB risk were predicted by fear of contracting TB and being a self-reported born-again Christian. In the follow-up study, heavy drinking and smoking in shebeens (unlicensed township liquor outlets) was associated with a risky lifestyle that can spread both TB and HIV. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the roles of church and shebeen in providing social support to township dwellers to cope with problems of daily life. It is tentatively concluded that the stereotypical shebeen ‘drinkers and smokers’, alternatively pitied and maligned by moral society, might serve as the scapegoat that deflects pollution from the ‘new’ TB linked to the AIDS epidemic.","Møller, Valerie; Erstad, Ida; Zani, Dalinyebo",Soc Indic Res,367,21
