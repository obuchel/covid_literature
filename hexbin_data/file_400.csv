3259,Cytomegalovirus infection and outcome in immunocompetent patients in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2018-06-28,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common in immunocompetent patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, whether CMV infection or CMV reactivation contributes to mortality of immunocompetent patients remains unclear. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for relevant studies published before May 30, 2016. Studies reporting on CMV infection in immunocompetent patients in ICUs and containing 2 × 2 tables on CMV results and all-cause mortality were included. RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 2398 immunocompetent patients admitted to ICUs were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of CMV infection was 27% (95%CI 22–34%, I(2) = 89%, n = 2398) and the CMV reactivation was 31% (95%CI 24–39%, I(2) = 74%, n = 666). The odds ratio (OR) for all-cause mortality among patients with CMV infection, compared with those without infection, was 2.16 (95%CI 1.70–2.74, I(2) = 10%, n = 2239). Moreover, upon exclusion of studies in which antiviral treatment was possibly or definitely provided to some patients, the association of mortality rate with CMV infection was also statistically significant (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 1.01–2.83, I(2) = 37%, n = 912,). For CMV seropositive patients, the OR for mortality in patients with CMV reactivation as compared with patients without CMV reactivation was 1.72 (95%CI 1.04–2.85, I(2) = 29%, n = 664). Patients with CMV infection required significantly longer mechanical ventilation (mean difference (MD): 9 days (95% CI 5–14, I(2) = 81%, n = 875)) and longer duration of ICU stay (MD: 12 days (95% CI 7–17, I(2) = 70%, n = 949)) than patients without CMV infection. When analysis was limited to detection in blood, CMV infection without antiviral drug treatment or reactivation was not significantly associated with higher mortality (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 0.81–3.54, I(2) = 52%, n = 722; OR: 1.49, I(2) = 63%, n = 469). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients without immunosuppression admitted to ICUs show a high rate of CMV infection. CMV infection during the natural unaltered course or reactivation in critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality, but have no effect on mortality when CMV in blood. More studies are needed to clarify the impact of CMV infection on clinical outcomes in those patients.

7311,A Simple Scoring Method for Predicting the Low Risk of Persistent Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Adult Patients,2020-03-31,"Gangliosides are structurally and functionally polymorphic sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are widely distributed in the human body. They play important roles in protecting us against immune attacks, yet they can become targets for autoimmunity and act as receptors for microbes, like the influenza viruses, and toxins, such as the cholera toxin. The expression patterns of gangliosides vary in different tissues, during different life periods, as well as in different animals. Antibodies against gangliosides (AGA) can target immune attack e.g., against neuronal cells and neutralize their complement inhibitory activity. AGAs are important especially in acquired demyelinating immune-mediated neuropathies, like Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variant, the Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS). They can emerge in response to different microbial agents and immunological insults. Thereby, they can be involved in a variety of diseases. In addition, antibodies against GM3 were found in the sera of patients vaccinated with Pandemrix®, who developed secondary narcolepsy, strongly supporting the autoimmune etiology of the disease.","Cutillo, Gianni; Saariaho, Anna-Helena; Meri, Seppo",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109116/,400

Socio-cultural mechanisms linking LGBT stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV among LGBT persons in Lesotho are understudied. We explore associations between LGBT stigma, mental health stressors, and HIV vulnerabilities among LGBT persons in Lesotho. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 46 LGBT persons and six key informants (e.g. healthcare providers). Participants described depression, substance use, and HIV as mutually reinforcing and situated in larger social contexts of stigma. Alcohol use was a stigma coping strategy and a way to build LGBT connections. At the same time, alcohol use elevated HIV vulnerabilities by lowering condom use uptake. Pervasive stigma reinforced barriers to healthcare engagement. Community-led support and services were leveraged to navigate stigma, reduce HIV vulnerabilities, and ultimately improve health. Findings emphasize the key role contexts play in shaping sexual and mental health among LGBT persons in Lesotho.","Logie, Carmen H.; Perez-Brumer, Amaya; Mothopeng, Tampose; Latif, Maya; Ranotsi, Amelia; Baral, Stefan D.",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222929/,400
11271,Positive end-expiratory pressure titration via esophageal balloon monitoring in a morbidly obese patient undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy,2020-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that higher rates of antibiotic resistance are found in countries with higher antibiotic consumption. The global increase in antibiotic consumption is a major public health concern. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the antibiotic dispensing patterns in public hospitals in Hong Kong from 2000 to 2015. METHODS: We acquired data on all hospital admissions with any antibiotics dispensed from 2000 to 2015 from the Hong Kong public hospitals. The annual proportion of hospital admissions with antibiotics dispensed was estimated and stratified by age group. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to examine any potential change in tetracycline dispensing after the release of the new clinical practice guideline. RESULTS: A total of 35,535,506 antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed among 2,161,360 unique hospitalized patients from 2000 to 2015. Antibiotics were dispensed in 29.2% of all hospital admissions in the public hospitals, the annual proportions of hospital admissions with antibiotics dispensed increased over the study period from 27.87% in 2000 to 31.39% in 2015, ranging from 27.17 to 31.39%. However, a significant increase was only observed in age groups of 5–19, 20–44, and 85 years or above when stratifying by age. In the interrupted time series analysis, a change in trend was detected for tetracycline dispensing that coincided with the time of publication of the new clinical practice guideline. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the overall volume of antibiotic use increased between 2000 and 2015. The rise in the dispensing of carbapenems in our study is concerning. The significant change in tetracycline use after being recommended as one of the preferred regimens demonstrated that the change in the clinical practice guideline had an immediate effect on the antibiotic prescribing practice in Hong Kong public hospitals.","Chui, Celine S.

11823,Performance and impact of a multiplex PCR in ICU patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Lissencephaly is a brain malformation characterized by smooth and thickened cerebral surface, which may result in structural epilepsy. Lissencephaly is not common in veterinary medicine. Here, we characterize the first cases of lissencephaly in four Shih Tzu dogs, including clinical presentations and findings of magnetic resonance imaging of lissencephaly and several concomitant brain malformations. CASE PRESENTATION: Early-onset acute signs of forebrain abnormalities were observed in all dogs, which were mainly cluster seizures and behavioral alterations. Based on neurological examination, the findings were consistent with symmetrical and bilateral forebrain lesions. Metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases were excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging for three dogs showed diffuse neocortical agyria and thickened gray matter while one dog had mixed agyria and pachygyria. Other features, such as internal hydrocephalus, supracollicular fluid accumulation, and corpus callosum hypoplasia, were detected concomitantly. Antiepileptic drugs effectively controlled cluster seizures, however, sporadic isolated seizures and signs of forebrain abnormalities, such as behavioral alterations, central blindness, and strabismus persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Lissencephaly should be considered an important differential diagnosis in Shih Tzu dogs presenting with early-onset signs of forebrain abnormalities, including cluster seizures and behavioral alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging was appropriate for ante-mortem diagnosis of lissencephaly and associated cerebral anomalies.","Rodríguez-Sánchez, Diego Noé; Pinto, Giovana Boff Araujo; Thomé, Edval Fernando; Machado, Vânia Maria de Vasconcelos; Amorim, Rogério Martins",Acta Vet Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305484/,400

Public health decision makers need information to compare interventions so that efforts can be focused on interventions most likely to have the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality. To guide decision making, CDC's pandemic response leadership turned to experts in modeling for assistance. H7N9 modeling results provided a quantitative estimate of the impact of different interventions and emphasized the importance of key assumptions. In addition, these H7N9 modeling efforts highlighted the need for modelers to work closely with investigators collecting data so that model assumptions can be adjusted as new information becomes available and with decision makers to ensure that the results of modeling impact policy decisions.","Rasmussen, Sonja A.; Redd, Stephen C.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314130/,400
12584,Physiological effects of two driving pressure-based methods to set positive end-expiratory pressure during one lung ventilation,2020-08-20,"Despite various clinical modalities available for patients, heart disease remains among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Genetic medicine, particularly mRNA, has broad potential as a therapeutic. More specifically, mRNA-based protein delivery has been used in the fields of cancer and vaccination, but recent changes to the structural composition of mRNA have led the scientific community to swiftly embrace it as a new drug to deliver missing genes to injured myocardium and many other organs. Modified mRNA (modRNA)–based gene delivery features transient but potent protein translation and low immunogenicity, with minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis. In this review, we compared and listed the advantages of modRNA over traditional vectors for cardiac therapy, with particular focus on using modRNA therapy in cardiac repair. We present a comprehensive overview of modRNA’s role in cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation, cardiac vascularization, and prevention of cardiac apoptosis. We also emphasize recent advances in modRNA delivery strategies and discuss the challenges for its clinical translation.","Kaur, Keerat; Zangi, Lior",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441140/,400
15552,Prognostic value of lymphocyte counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with acute respiratory failure: a retrospective cohort study,2021-02-23,"OBJECTIVE: Efficient gene transfer to the vascular wall via intravenous vector injection would be useful for experimental vascular biology and gene therapy. Initial studies of lentiviral vector tropism suggested that intravenously injected vectors do not transduce murine vascular tissue; however, there are also reports of highly efficient aortic transduction after jugular vein injection of high-titer lentiviral vectors. We sought to reproduce these results. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We injected high-titer preparations of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-expressing lentiviral vector into jugular veins of 8 mice; 6 mice received vehicle only. Four days later, samples of aorta (thoracic and abdominal), liver, spleen, and other tissues were harvested and processed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction detection of vector DNA and immunohistochemical detection of GFP. Our vector DNA assay did not detect transduction of any of the 16 aortic segments. This finding excludes an aortic transduction efficiency of >0.02 vector copies per cell. In contrast, vector DNA was detected in all 8 spleen and liver extracts (median, 0.8 and 0.1 vector copies per cell, respectively; P<0.001 versus vehicle controls). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction signals from DNA extracted from heart, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, and femoral artery did not differ from background polymerase chain reaction signals from DNA extracted from tissues of vehicle-injected mice (P≥0.7 for all). Immunohistochemistry revealed GFP in scattered cells in spleen and liver, not in aorta. CONCLUSIONS: Injection of high-titer lentiviral vectors via the jugular vein transduces cells in the spleen and liver but does not efficiently transduce the aorta.","Bi, Lianxiang; Wacker, Bradley K.; Stamatikos, Alexis; Sethuraman, Meena; Komandur, Kaushik; Dichek, David A.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901533/,400

20875,Best pre-ductal PaO(2) prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as predictor of mortality in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a retrospective analysis of a Japanese database,2021-09-06,"With the aging population, an increasing number of older adults (> 65 years) will be affected by problematic opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD), with both illicit and prescription opioids. Problematic opioid use is defined as the use of opioids resulting in social, medical or psychological consequences, whereas OUD is a form of problematic use that meets diagnostic criteria as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition. Problematic use of opioids by older adults is associated with a number of pertinent adverse effects, including sedation, cognitive impairment, falls, fractures and constipation. Risk factors for problematic opioid use in this population include pain, comorbid medical illnesses, concurrent alcohol use disorder and depression. Treatment of OUD consists of acute detoxification and maintenance therapy. At this time, there have been no randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for OUD in this population, with recommendations based on data from younger adults. Despite this, opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is recommended for both stages of treatment in older adults with OUD. Buprenorphine is recommended as a first line agent over methadone in the older adult population, due to a more favourable safety profile and relative accessibility. Use of methadone in this population is complicated by risk of QT interval prolongation and respiratory depression. Available observational data suggests that older adults respond well to OAT and age should not be a barrier to treatment. Further research is required to inform treatment decisions in this population.","Dufort, Alexander; Samaan, Zainab",Drugs Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421190/,400

Classification and regression tree analysis was used to identify predictive factors for GT. RESULTS: Several factors were associated with GT requirements. Four factors included in the model were postmenstrual age (PMA) at first oral feeding, birth GA, high-frequency ventilation exposure, necrotizing enterocolitis stage II/III. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.944 in the test cohort, 0.815 in the validation cohort. Implementation plan based on the model was developed.

22261,High incidence of respiratory viruses in critically ill adult patients with respiratory failure,2013-03-19,"Social behavioral changes, including social isolation or loneliness, increase the risk for stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide, which share a strong neuroinflammatory etiopathogenetic component. The peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α, a newly discovered target involved in emotional behavior regulation, is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor and a transcription factor that, following stimulation by endogenous or synthetic ligands, may induce neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation, and improve anxiety and depression-like behaviors by enhancing neurosteroid biosynthesis. How stress affects epigenetic mechanisms with downstream effects on inflammation and emotional behavior remains poorly understood. We studied the effects of 4-week social isolation, using a mouse model of PTSD/suicide-like behavior, on hippocampal PPAR-α epigenetic modification. Decreased PPAR-α expression in the hippocampus of socially isolated mice was associated with increased levels of methylated cytosines of PPAR-α gene CpG-rich fragments and deficient neurosteroid biosynthesis. This effect was associated with increased histone deacetylases (HDAC)1, methyl-cytosine binding protein (MeCP)2 and decreased ten-eleven translocator (TET)2 expression, which favor hypermethylation. These alterations were associated with increased TLR-4 and pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-α,), mediated by NF-κB signaling in the hippocampus of aggressive mice. This study contributes the first evidence of stress-induced brain PPAR-α epigenetic regulation. Social isolation stress may constitute a risk factor for inflammatory-based psychiatric disorders associated with neurosteroid deficits, and targeting epigenetic marks linked to PPAR-α downregulation may offer a valid therapeutic approach.","Matrisciano, Francesco; Pinna, Graziano",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509148/,400

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) are the common cancer treatments. In addition to these limitations, the development of adverse effects from chemotherapy and RT reduces the quality of life for cancer patients. Cellular radiosensitivity, or the ability to resist and overcome cell damage caused by ionizing radiation (IR), is directly related to cancer cells’ response to RT. Therefore, radiobiological research is emphasizing chemical compounds ’radiosensitization of cancer cells so that they are more reactive in the IR spectrum. Recent years researchers have seen an increase in interest in natural products that have antitumor effects with minimal side effects. Natural products, on the other hand, are easy to recover and therefore less expensive. There have been several scientific studies done based on these compounds that have tested their ability in vitro and in vivo to induce tumor radiosensitization. The role of natural products in RT, as well as their usefulness and potential applications, is the goal of this current review.","Akter, Rokeya; Najda, Agnieszka; Rahman, Md.

35180,Did Persian Nowruz Aggravate the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Crisis in Iran?,2020-05-29,"Interpolation and approximation methods are used in many fields such as in engineering as well as other disciplines for various scientific discoveries. If the data domain is formed by scattered data, approximation methods may become very complicated as well as time-consuming. Usually, the given data is tessellated by some method, not necessarily the Delaunay triangulation, to produce triangular or tetrahedral meshes. After that approximation methods can be used to produce the surface. However, it is difficult to ensure the continuity and smoothness of the final interpolant along with all adjacent triangles. In this contribution, a meshless approach is proposed by using radial basis functions (RBFs). It is applicable to explicit functions of two variables and it is suitable for all types of scattered data in general. The key point for the RBF approximation is finding the important points that give a good approximation with high precision to the scattered data. Since the compactly supported RBFs (CSRBF) has limited influence in numerical computation, large data sets can be processed efficiently as well as very fast via some efficient algorithm. The main advantage of the RBF is, that it leads to a solution of a system of linear equations (SLE) Ax = b. Thus any efficient method solves the systems of linear equations that can be used. In this study is we propose a new method of determining the importance points on the scattered data that produces a very good reconstructed surface with higher accuracy while maintaining the smoothness of the surface.","Skala, Vaclav; Karim, Samsul Ariffin Abdul; Cervenka, Martin",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304710/,400

In comparison, topical delivery of protein drugs to the lung via inhalation is deemed to be a more effective approach for lung diseases, as proteins would directly reach the target in the lung while exhibiting poor diffusion into the systemic circulation, leading to higher lung drug retention and efficacy while minimising toxicity to other organs. This review examines the important considerations and challenges in designing an inhaled protein therapeutics for local lung delivery: the choice of inhalation device, structural changes affecting drug deposition in diseased lungs, clearance mechanisms affecting an inhaled protein drug’s lung accumulation, protein stability, and immunogenicity.

Isolation of E. dermatitidis from patients with mild symptoms may be difficult to interpret whether is a contaminant or asymptomatic patient with serious infection. However, it is important to diagnose asymptomatic patients early in the stage because of up to 25% mortality rate. RESULTS: 77-year-old male with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to his pulmonologist with cough. He was started on azithromycin and steroids. His cough worsened and he was transitioned to levofloxacin with continuation of steroid treatment. In addition, he developed fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, chills and nights sweat along with some urinary complaints. His chest X-ray showed infiltrates and he was diagnosed with left lower lung pneumonia and urinary tract infection and was treated with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures were drawn. Additional past medical history was not significant. Blood culture became positive on day 4 of incubation. Gram stain showed yeast-like cells, but the blood culture multiplex PCR was negative. Serum cryptococcus antigen was negative. Three days later, a dark shiny olive-colored colony with dark obverse side was isolated. It grew at 42 C. Microscopic examination revealed hyaline and pigmented hyphae with brown conidia. It was identified as Exophiala dermatitidis and confirmed by the state public health laboratory. Blood cultures drawn after hospital admission remained negative. Patient’s symptoms improved with antibiotic treatment. Therefore the clinicians believed that the E. dermatitidis was a probable contaminant and patient was discharged with follow-up. During the follow-up process he developed respiratory infection with Coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43). Follow-up continues. CONCLUSION: Blood cultures are not sensitive for mold infection especially for an uncommon contaminant like E. dermatitidis, it may be difficult to decide whether a positive culture is a real result or not. Fungal antigen tests such as beta-D-glucan test may be helpful in distinguishing between invasive infection and contaminant. Additionally, we believe that in our case, steroid use could have caused a temporary immunosuppression and led to Exophiala dermatitidis infection.","Yurtsever, N; Dougherty, P; Condon, S; Orsini, R; Berman, M; Berry, G J; Duong, S",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665285/,400

Trainee research collaboratives have demonstrated they can nurture the research skills of students and trainees while delivering high quality research outputs. However, we have been unable to identify a permanent medical education research collaborative for trainees and students. METHODS: We started the MedEd Collaborative in September 2020 to fill this gap, consisting of a trainee- and student-led medical education research collaborative supported by senior medical education experts and clinicians. RESULTS: Our vision is to increase engagement of students and trainees in high-quality medical education research that informs practice. The MedEd Collaborative will engage students and trainees in medical education research by completing at least one national multicentre study per year, the first being the COVID Ready 2 study. This is a national cross-sectional survey of the educational impact of medical student volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate the MedEd collaborative will: increase exposure to medical education research, thereby increasing the number of medical students and trainees aiming to pursue an academic medical education career; provide training in medical education research methodologies, such as qualitative analysis; improve the quality of medical education research outputs from students and trainees; encourage collaboration between medical schools and deaneries; and provide support to other trainee research collaboratives that aim to explore education research in their own specialties.","Byrne, Matthew H V; Ashcroft, James; Alexander, Laith; Wan, Jonathan C M; Harvey, Anna; Schindler, Nick; Brown, Megan E L; Burford, Bryan; Vance, Gill; Byrne, Matthew",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083515/,400

Vitamin D is an important modulator of the immune system. Although serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels can be raised through diet or supplements, most vitamin D in the body is the result of dermal synthesis from ultraviolet radiation. The production of vitamin D in the skin, however, can be limited by latitude, skin-covering clothes, the use of sunblock, and skin pigmentation. Vitamin D deficiency affects a high percentage of the world population. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are suboptimal, not only in specific risk groups but also in adults from many countries. Low vitamin D levels, therefore, represent a risk factor for several different pathologies, including SAR-CoV-2. This study used an ecological design to assess the association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 incidence, complications, and mortality across 46 countries. All data were obtained from published sources. The results of the study suggest an association at the population level between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the risk of being infected with COVID-19, severity of the disease, and risk of dying from it.","Mariani, Javier; Giménez, Virna Margarita Marín; Bergam, Ivana; Tajer, Carlos; Antonietti, Laura; Inserra, Filipe; Ferder, León; Manucha, Walter",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325788/,400

METHODS Four surgical trainees each performed three porcine cholecystectomies using three randomized techniques including MAGS/PSS, SSL, and LAP. The operative outcomes, procedure-specific ratings (1-5 scale; 1 = superior), workload (1-10 scale; 1 = superior), and global impressions (1-10 scale; 10 = superior) were recorded. Comparisons used analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks (Kruskal-Wallis), and p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS The operative outcomes were similar except for significantly higher blood loss with SSL (16.3 ± 10.3) versus LAP (2.8 ± 1.5; p < 0.05) but not with MAGS/PSS (4.8 ± 3.8). Several inadvertent tissue-damaging events occurred with SSL but not with MAGS/PSS or LAP. The incision was significantly shorter with MAGS/PSS (29.3 ± 2.8 mm) and SSL (29.3 ± 2.5 mm) than with LAP (48.0 ± 3.6 mm; p < 0.05). Compared with SSL (3.6 ± 0.5), the procedure-specific ratings significantly favored MAGS/PSS (2.8 ± 0.4) and LAP (1.7 ± 0.2; p < 0.05). Ergonomics and technical challenges both were rated significantly inferior with SSL (4.3 ± 1.0 and 3.8 ± 0.5, respectively) versus LAP (1.5 ± 0.6 and 2.0 ± 0.8, respectively; p < 0.05) but not with MAGS/PSS (2.5 ± 1.0 and 3.0 ± 0.8, respectively). Both MAGS/PSS (4.5 ± 0.5) and SSL (4.8 ± 1.0) were associated with a significantly greater workload than LAP (2.5 ± 0.6; p < 0.05). Global impression ratings were significantly higher for LAP (8.7 ± 1.3) versus SSL (5.8 ± 2.0; p < 0.05) but not for MAGS/PSS (7.1 ± 1.8). Cosmesis was significantly better with MAGS/PSS (9.5 ± 0.6) versus LAP (6.5 ± 2.4; p < 0.05) but not with SSL (8.8 ± 1.3). CONCLUSION The MAGS/PSS technique allows better triangulation and fewer technical difficulties than SSL and better cosmesis than LAP. Further development of these devices is warranted.","Arain, Nabeel A; Rondon, Luisangel; Hogg, Deborah C; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Bergs, Richard; Fernandez, Raul; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2354-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648118/,400

66025,A special thank you to our authors for their responses to the coronavirus disease pandemic.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common cause of pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The importance of VRI in adult CF populations is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence and clinical impact of VRI among adults with CF. METHODS One hundred adults with CF were followed up prospectively for 12 months. Sputum, nose swabs and throat swabs were collected every 2 months and at onset of pulmonary exacerbation. PCR assays for adenovirus, influenza A&B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus were performed on each sample. Symptom scores, spirometry and inflammatory markers were measured at each visit. RESULTS One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 191/626 (30.5%) visits. Human rhinovirus accounted for 72.5% of viruses. Overall incidence of VRI was 1.66 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.92) cases/patient-year. VRI was associated with increased risk of pulmonary exacerbation (OR=2.19; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.08; p<0.001) and prescription of antibiotics (OR=2.26; 95% CI 1.63 to 3.13; p<0.001). Virus-positive visits were associated with higher respiratory symptom scores and greater C-reactive protein levels. Virus-positive exacerbations had a lower acute fall in FEV1 than virus-negative exacerbations (12.7% vs 15.6%; p=0.040). The incidence of exacerbations, but not VRI, was associated with greater lung function decline over 12 months (-1.79% per pulmonary exacerbation/year; 95% CI -3.4 to -0.23; p=0.025). CONCLUSION VRI is common in adults with CF and is associated with substantial morbidity. Respiratory viruses are a potential therapeutic target in CF lung disease.","Flight, William G; Bright-Thomas, Rowland J; Tilston, Peter; Mutton, Kenneth J; Guiver, Malcolm; Morris, Julie; Webb, A Kevin; Jones, Andrew M",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24127019/,400
66107,Noninvasive ventilation versus oxygen therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (μ-dHACM) is derived from donated human placentae and has anti-inflammatory, low immunogenic and anti-fibrotic properties. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the efficacy of μ-dHACM as a disease modifying intervention in a rat model of osteoarthritis (OA). It was hypothesized that intra-articular injection of μ-dHACM would attenuate OA progression. METHODS Lewis rats underwent medial meniscal transection (MMT) surgery to induce OA. Twenty four hours post-surgery, μ-dHACM or saline was injected intra-articularly into the rat joint. Naïve rats also received μ-dHACM injections. Microstructural changes in the tibial articular cartilage were assessed using equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent (EPIC-μCT) at 21 days post-surgery. The joint was also evaluated histologically and synovial fluid was analyzed for inflammatory markers at 3 and 21 days post-surgery. RESULTS There was no measured baseline effect of μ-dHACM on cartilage in naïve animals. Histological staining of treated joints showed presence of μ-dHACM in the synovium along with local hypercellularity at 3 and 21 days post-surgery. In MMT animals, development of cartilage lesions at 21 days was prevented and number of partial erosions was significantly reduced by treatment with μ-dHACM. EPIC-μCT analysis quantitatively showed that μ-dHACM reduced proteoglycan loss in MMT animals. CONCLUSIONS μ-dHACM is rapidly sequestered in the synovial membrane following intra-articular injection and attenuates cartilage degradation in a rat OA model. These data suggest that intra-articular delivery of μ-dHACM may have a therapeutic effect on OA development.","Willett, Nick J; Thote, Tanushree; Lin, Angela S P; Moran, Shamus; Raji, Yazdan; Sridaran, Sanjay; Stevens, Hazel Y; Guldberg, Robert E",Arthritis research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/ar4476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499554/,400

This development is thanks to the increase in data availability as well as to advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning research and access to computational resources. Highly promising research examples are published daily. However, at the same time, there are some unrealistic, often overly optimistic, expectations and assumptions with regard to the development, validation and acceptance of such methods. The healthcare application field introduces requirements and potential pitfalls that are not immediately obvious from the 'general data science' viewpoint. Reliable, objective, and generalisable validation and performance assessment of developed data-analysis methods is one particular pain-point. This may lead to unmet schedules and disappointments regarding true performance in real-life with as result poor uptake (or non-uptake) at the end-user side. It is the aim of this tutorial to provide practical guidance on how to assess performance reliably and efficiently and avoid common traps especially when dealing with application for health and wellness settings. Instead of giving a list of do's and don't s, this tutorial tries to build a better understanding behind these issues and presents both the most relevant performance evaluation criteria as well as approaches how to compute them.

However, it has the following disadvantages: it provides a narrower surgical field than conventional laparoscopic appendectomy, which requires a considerably longer operative time to achieve surgical skills. This study was conducted to evaluate the learning curve for SPLA. METHODS This study included a total of 120 patients with acute abdomen who visited our emergency department and were diagnosed with acute appendicitis between March 2013 and February 2015. They underwent SPLA by a single surgeon. Patients were divided into 4 groups of 30 patients each according to operation dates. Operative time, time to resume oral intake, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were analyzed. RESULTS The mean operative time was 59.9 ± 19.9 min. It was shortened after completion of 30 operations and remained unchanged until it was further shortened after completion of 90 operations. There was no significant difference in time to resumption of oral intake or length of hospital stay between the 4 groups. Postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients, but the frequency of the complications was not significantly different between the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that surgeons can achieve surgical skills for SPLA after completion of 30 operations and more experienced surgical skills by SPLA successfully after completion of 90 operations.","Kim, YongHun; Lee, WooSurng",World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13017-016-0096-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499804/,400

68721,Echocardiography during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic - the impact of the vaccination program. A 2021 update of the expert opinion of the Working Group on Echocardiography of the Polish Cardiac Society.,2021,"BACKGROUND Current evidence suggests that corticosteroid injection alone expedites the recovery of pain-free range of motion (ROM) in patients with adhesive capsulitis compared to physiotherapy or placebo. However, it remains unclear whether the addition of hydrodilatation with corticosteroid provides improvement in pain-free ROM as well as pain relief. OBJECTIVE A review of the literature was conducted to determine whether the combined intervention of hydrodilatation and corticosteroid injection expedites restoration of pain-free ROM compared to a control treatment of corticosteroid injection in patients with adhesive capsulitis. METHODS EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were searched from database inception to January 2017. Relevant studies were determined as randomized controlled trials written in English, comparing the outcomes of hydrodilatation and corticosteroid injection to a control group treated with corticosteroid injection alone in patients with adhesive capsulitis. Two independent reviewers assessed manuscripts for study inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS A total of 2276 studies were identified through the search, of which 6 randomized controlled studies (involving 410 shoulders) met criteria for inclusion in this review. Mean age ranged from 51-61 years, with mean symptom duration of 4-9 months. Studies varied significantly regarding the volume of injectate, anatomical injection approach, symptom duration, and the method of glenohumeral capsule distension (capsular rupture versus preservation). Two studies demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in the combination group at 3-month follow-up, and one study demonstrated clinically significant improvement only in ROM and/or pain/functional scales, compared to 3 studies demonstrating no benefit when compared to corticosteroid injection alone. CONCLUSION Combining hydrodilatation with corticosteroid injection potentially expedites recovery of pain-free ROM. The greatest benefit is experienced within the first 3 months of intervention. Differences in hydrodilatation techniques, inclusion of capsular preservation, anatomical approach, and length of symptoms may explain the variability in efficacy demonstrated. Further trials using larger sample sizes, better anatomical approaches, image guidance, and hydrodilatation techniques are required to determine the true nature of benefits of hydrodilatation with corticosteroid injection.

This rapid systematic review synthesised published reports of medical educational developments in response to the pandemic, considering descriptions of interventions, evaluation data and lessons learned. METHODS The authors systematically searched four online databases and hand searched MedEdPublish up to 24 May 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias for included articles. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. A descriptive synthesis and outcomes were reported. RESULTS Forty-nine articles were included. The majority were from North America, Asia and Europe. Sixteen studies described Kirkpatrick's outcomes, with one study describing levels 1-3. A few papers were of exceptional quality, though the risk of bias framework generally revealed capricious reporting of underpinning theory, resources, setting, educational methods, and content. Key developments were pivoting educational delivery from classroom-based learning to virtual spaces, replacing clinical placement based learning with alternate approaches, and supporting direct patient contact with mitigated risk. Training for treating patients with COVID-19, service reconfiguration, assessment, well-being, faculty development, and admissions were all addressed, with the latter categories receiving the least attention. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights several areas of educational response in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies a few articles of exceptional quality that can serve as models for future developments and educational reporting. There was often a lack of practical detail to support the educational community in enactment of novel interventions, as well as limited evaluation data. However, the range of options deployed offers much guidance for the medical education community moving forward and there was an indication that outcome data and greater detail will be reported in the future.","Gordon, Morris; Patricio, Madalena; Horne, Laura; Muston, Alexandra; Alston, Sebastian R; Pammi, Mohan; Thammasitboon, Satid; Park, Sophie; Pawlikowska, Teresa; Rees, Eliot L; Doyle, Andrea Jane; Daniel, Michelle",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1807484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847456/,400

The purpose of this study was to review the results of standardizing AP techniques to reduce variation among clinicians and its effect on clinical outcomes. Standardized goal-directed protocols for AP were established by the cardiac team and applied to all adult cardiac surgical patients where CPB was used. Following Institutional Review Board approval, data were analyzed for two sequential groups of patients: Non-standardized AP (NST-AP) and standardized AP (ST-AP). Exclusion criteria included pre-CPB hemodynamic instability and preoperative hematocrit (Hct) values less than 30%. The primary end point was the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas secondary end points included Hct change and other perioperative allogeneic blood product transfusions. Data are presented as mean and SD. Of the 192 patients evaluated, 82 were in the NST-AP group and 110 in the ST-AP group. There were no preoperative demographic differences across groups. Total AP volume was lower in the NST-AP group than in the ST-AP patients (486.8 ± 259.6 mL vs. 1,048.2 ± 218.7 mL, p < .001). Whereas pre-CPB Hct values were identical between the groups, the first on-CPB (25.7% ± 4.5% vs. 27.9% ± 4.2%, p < .001), high CPB (27.7% ± 3.5% vs. 29.1% ± 3.6%, p < .008), and first postoperative (32.5% ± 4.0% vs. 34.3% ± 3.9%, p < .003) were all significantly higher in ST-AP patients. Perioperative transfusion rate was higher in NST-AP patients (63.6%) vs. ST-AP (44.6%), p < .01. There was no difference in intraoperative RBC transfusion, but postoperatively, more patients in the NST-AP group received RBCs than those in the ST-AP group (51.2% vs. 28.2%, p < .01). The application of an ST-AP protocol was effective in reducing hemodilution, which was associated within higher Hcts and lower postoperative transfusion rates.","H Stammers, Alfred; Francis, Stephen; Tesdahl, Eric A; Miller, Randi; Nostro, Anthony; Mongero, Linda B",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,https://doi.org/10.1182/ject-1900016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31915406/,400

Policies, programs, and interventions supporting maternal and child health and nutrition have the potential to improve child growth and development. OBJECTIVE This article synthesizes the available global evidence on the drivers of national declines in stunting prevalence and compares the relative effect of major drivers of stunting decline between countries. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of published peer-reviewed and gray literature analyzing the relation between changes in key determinants of child linear growth and contemporaneous changes in linear growth outcomes over time. RESULTS Among the basic determinants of stunting assessed within regression-decomposition analyses, improvement in asset index score was a consistent and strong driver of improved linear growth outcomes. Increased parental education was also a strong predictor of improved child growth. Of the underlying determinants of stunting, reduced rates of open defecation, improved sanitation infrastructure, and improved access to key maternal health services, including optimal antenatal care and delivery in a health facility or with a skilled birth attendant, all accounted for substantially improved child growth, although the magnitude of variation explained by each differed substantially between countries. At the immediate level, changes in several maternal characteristics predicted modest stunting reductions, including parity, interpregnancy interval, and maternal height. CONCLUSIONS Unique sets of stunting determinants predicted stunting reduction within countries that have reduced stunting. Several common drivers emerge at the basic, underlying, and immediate levels, including improvements in maternal and paternal education, household socioeconomic status, sanitation conditions, maternal health services access, and family planning. Further data collection and in-depth mixed-methods research are required to strengthen recommendations for those countries where the stunting burden remains unacceptably high.","Vaivada, Tyler; Akseer, Nadia; Akseer, Selai; Somaskandan, Ahalya; Stefopulos, Marianne; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",The American journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860401/,400

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to provide guidance on this process through the development of the Health utility Application Tool (HAT). METHODS We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with Canadian stakeholders from reimbursement bodies, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry to identify current practices and perspectives of the application of the health utility literature to CUAs. An online survey with international members of the general health economics and outcomes research community was also conducted to gather opinions on key concepts. RESULTS Based on the themes emerging from the interviews and online questionnaire, the HAT includes questions prompting investigators to consider the following constructs: similarity of the clinical condition in the health utility study and the CUA; similarity of health utility study participant demographics and the demographics of the CUA's target population; similarity of the health state descriptions in the health utility study and the CUA; and the method of assigning utility weights. Considerations of transparency prompted additional items, including: means by which the health utility study was identified; type of respondents; study design; and measure used to collect health utility estimates. CONCLUSION The HAT is intended to guide the evaluation of the applicability of published health utilities for a CUA, thus promoting transparency and accountability in the selection of model inputs.","Zoratti, Michael J; Chan, Kelvin K W; Husereau, Don; Krahn, Murray; Levine, Mitchell; Thabane, Lehana; Xie, Feng",PharmacoEconomics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-021-01039-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151407/,400

MATERIAL AND METHODS The experiment was conducted on four domestic pigs. Nine weeks prior to implant insertion, second and third mandibular premolars were extracted. Each animal received six implants in lower jaw. On one randomly chosen side of jaw flapless technique using mini-incision was performed, while on the other side implants were inserted after flap raising. After 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, the experimental animals were sacrificed. Following mandibular resection and decalcification, the samples for histopathological analysis of the peri-implant bone were obtained in the empty implant bed area, from the buccal side of the mandible, adjacent to implant neck region and parallel to crestal edge of implant bed. The degree of inflammatory response of the peri-implant bone was estimated through ordinal scores from 0 to 2. RESULTS Seven days after the surgery all samples in the flap group had score 2 indicating high inflammation degree, in contrast to lower inflammatory reaction in flapless group. On the 14th and 21st postoperative day decreasing of inflammation degree was noted in all samples of the flapless group (score 1), while in flap group samples presented scores 1 and 2.

There is currently no set of simple, readily available and fast battery of tests that can be used in the ED as prognostic factors. The purpose was to study laboratory test results in patients with COVID-19 at hospital emergency admission and to evaluate the results in non-survivors and their potential prognostic value. A profile of laboratory markers was agreed with the ED providers based on the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommendation of its usefulness, which was made in 218 patients with COVID-19. Non-survivors were significantly older, and the percentage of patients with pathological values of creatinine, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein, prothrombin time, D-dimer, and arterial blood gas, PaO2/FIO2 and satO2/FIO2 indices were significantly higher among the patients with COVID-19 who died than those who survived. Patients who died also presented higher neutrophil counts. Among all studied tests, albumin and LDH were independent prognostic factors for death. The results of the study show pathology in nine laboratory markers in patients with COVID-19 admitted in the ED, valuable findings to take into consideration for its prompt identification when there is no immediate availability of RT-PCR results.","Salinas, Maria; Blasco, Álvaro; Santo-Quiles, Ana; Lopez-Garrigos, Maite; Flores, Emilio; Leiva-Salinas, Carlos",Journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023942/,400

Changes related to ethics review of clinical trials in the EU were considered to be essential to create a more favourable environment to conduct clinical trials in the EU. The concern is, however, that the role of the research ethics committees will weaken in at least some of the Member States because the new Regulation allows narrowing down the scope of ethics review as compared with the currently valid Clinical Trial Directive. Although the new Regulation may lead to faster approval procedures for clinical trials, which is especially relevant in the context of pandemics, high-quality ethics reviews integrating methodological aspects of a clinical trial should nevertheless be ensured. To maintain high research ethics standards as well as to foster measures to mitigate potential negative consequences of the reform, it is therefore of vital importance to start debating and sharing the reflections about the potential consequences of these transformations and trends as soon as possible.","Lukaseviciene, Vilma; Hasford, Joerg; Lanzerath, Dirk; Gefenas, Eugenijus",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361396/,400

METHODS One hundred patients with a simple oblique inguinal hernia were included and treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from July of 2015 to July of 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to TAPP inguinal hernioplasty with mesh fixation (fixation group, n = 50) or without mesh fixation (non-fixation group, n = 50). Observation indices such as mean operative time, time to ambulation, hospitalization expense, and complications were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS) was adopted for pain evaluation 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. The 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) was adopted for life quality scoring 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS No recurrence or incisional infections were observed during follow-up in either group. The mean operative time, time to ambulation, and hospitalization expense of the non-fixation group were all significantly reduced compared to those of the fixation group. The VAS score 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively of the non-fixation group were significantly lower than in the fixation group. The physical function, role physical, bodily pain, and general health in the non-fixation group were each significantly higher than in the fixation group. In contrast, vitality, social function, role emotional, and mental health showed no significant differences across groups. CONCLUSIONS For patients with primary unilateral oblique inguinal hernia with a defect size less than 4.0 cm in diameter, TAPP inguinal hernioplasty without mesh fixation was safe and effective. Furthermore, this shortened the operative time, promoted early ambulation, decreased hospitalization expenses, alleviated postoperative pain, and improved quality of life.","Li, Weiming; Sun, Dali; Sun, Yanbo; Cen, Yunyun; Li, Shumin; Xu, Qingwen; Li, Yijun; Qi, Yuxing; Lin, Yueying; Yang, Ting; Xu, Pengyuan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5485-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289971/,400

In this study, we demonstrated that the PRRSV nsp2 OTU domain antagonizes the type I interferon induction by interfering with the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Further analysis revealed that the nsp2 OTU domain possesses ubiquitin-deconjugating activity. This domain has the ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activation by interfering with the polyubiquitination process of IkappaBalpha, which subsequently prevents IkappaBalpha degradation. To determine whether the nsp2 protein antagonist function can be ablated from the virus, we introduced point mutations into the OTU domain region by use of reverse genetics. The D458A, S462A, and D465A mutations targeting on a B-cell epitope in the OTU domain region generated the viable recombinant viruses, and the S462A and D465A mutants were attenuated for growth in cell culture. The OTU domain mutants were examined to determine whether mutations in the nsp2 OTU domain region altered virus ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activation. The result showed that certain mutations lethal to virus replication impaired the ability of nsp2 to inhibit NF-kappaB activation but that the viable recombinant viruses, vSD-S462A and vSD-D465A, were unable to inhibit NF-kappaB activation as effectively as the wild-type virus. This study represents a fundamental step in elucidating the role of nsp2 in PRRS pathogenesis and provides an important insight in future modified live-virus vaccine development.","Sun, Zhi; Chen, Zhenhai; Lawson, Steven R; Fang, Ying",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00217-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504922/,400
97942,Use of an endoscopy face mask in patients with gastric distention undergoing noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure: a comparative case study report.,2012,"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is widely applied in foodborne pathogen detection and diagnosis. According to the cycles of threshold (Ct) values of qPCR testing, samples are judged as positive or negative. However, samples with Ct values in the gray zone are classified as ""possibly positive"" and required to be tested again. Repetitive qPCR may not eliminate the uncertain results but increase the workload of detection. CRISPR/Cas12a can specifically recognize the nucleic acid of the nM level and then indiscriminately slash the single-strand DNA with multiple turnovers. In this way, the detection signals can be greatly amplified. Here, we propose a CRISPR-based checking method to solve gray zone problems. After qPCR testing, the screening gray zone samples can be successfully checked by the CRISPR/Cas12a method. Furthermore, to conduct CRISPR reaction assay more conveniently and prevent possible aerosol contamination in the operational process, a gray zone checking cassette is designed. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based checking method. Of 28 real swine blood samples, 6 ASFV qPCR gray zone samples are successfully checked. The CRISPR-based checking method provides a novel solution to eliminate gray zone sample problems with no additional effects on the PCR, which is operable and applicable in practical detection. The entire process can be completed within 10-15 min. This method will be a good supplementary and assistance for qPCR-based detection, especially in the diagnosis of diseases such as COVID-19.","Chen, Yanju; Wu, Shuyue; Wu, Hui; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Xiaofu; Qian, Siwenjie; Zhang, Mengyao; Xu, Junfeng; Ji, Feng; Wu, Jian",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.1c00515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973766/,400

However, it remains unknown to what extent progress has been achieved in the prevention of cancer in the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. METHODS We analyzed trends in CRC incidence (2000-2016) and mortality (2000-2018) in Germany by sex, age, and tumor location. RESULTS The age-standardized incidence of CRC declined by 22.4% (from 65.3 to 50.7 per 100 000) in men and by 25.5% (from 42.7 to 31.8 per 100 000) in women. CRC mortality declined by 35.8% (from 29.6 to 19.0 per 100 000) in men and by 40.5% (19.0 to 11.3 per 100 000) in women. Despite demographic changes, the annual numbers of CRC cases and deaths still decreased from about 60 400 to 58 300 and from around 28 700 to 24 200, respectively. The decline in incidence was greatest in groups aged ≥ 55 years. While the incidence of cancer in the distal colon and rectum decreased by 34.5% and 26.2%, respectively, in men and by 41.0% and 27.9% in women, the incidence of proximal colon cancer remained stable in men and decreased by only 7.0% in women. However, a major shift towards earlier stages was observed for the proximal cancers. CONCLUSION The results support the assumption that the increased use of colo - noscopy has contributed to substantial reductions in the incidence of distal CRC incidence and the mortality from cancers in the entire colon and rectum.","Cardoso, Rafael; Zhu, Anna; Guo, Feng; Heisser, Thomas; Hoffmeister, Michael; Brenner, Hermann",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180790/,400

We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the squid Euprymna scolopes. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (ΔssrA) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host's response to colonization by the ΔssrA strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the ΔssrA strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont's sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host. In the absence of this communication, there are dramatic fitness consequences for both partners.","Moriano-Gutierrez, Silvia; Bongrand, Clotilde; Essock-Burns, Tara; Wu, Leo; McFall-Ngai, Margaret J; Ruby, Edward G",PLoS biology,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141816/,400

However, the use of QI techniques by healthcare professionals appears limited and constrained with only isolated examples of good practice. This study explores QI within the pharmacy context. Focusing on the community pharmacy 'Healthy Living Pharmacy scheme', this study aims to explore changes in QI understanding resulting from a postgraduate QI educational intervention. METHODS Four focus groups were held involving 13 community pharmacists enrolled onto a newly developed postgraduate QI educational module. Two focus groups were held before and two after the module's completion. Knowledge of QI and practical applications following the learning was explored. KEY FINDINGS Three themes emerged: pharmacists' motivation for learning about QI, conceptual understanding and translation into practice. Pharmacists expressed positive views about learning new skills but expressed logistical concerns about how they would accommodate the extra learning. Prior knowledge of QI was found to be lacking and its application in practice ineffectual. Following completion of the QI module, significant improvements in comprehension and application were seen. Pharmacists considered it too soon to make an assessment on patient outcomes as their improvements required time to effectively embed changes in practice.

At least twelve relevant papers appeared by 20 May 2020. The radiation dose proposed for clinical trials are a single dose (0.1-1 Gy) or two doses (a few mGy followed by 0.1-0.25 Gy involving a putative adaptive response, or 1-1.5 Gy in two fractions 2-3 days apart). The scientific rationale for such proposed so-called low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) is twofold (note that only doses below 0.1 Gy are considered as low doses in the field of radiation protection, but here we follow the term as conventionally used in the field of radiation oncology). Firstly, the potentially positive observations in human case series and biological studies in rodent models on viral or bacterial pneumonia that were conducted in the pre-antibiotic era. Secondly, the potential anti-inflammatory properties of LDRT, which have been seen when LDRT is applied locally to subacute degenerative joint diseases, mainly in Germany. However, the human and animal studies cited as supportive evidence have significant limitations, and whether LDRT produces anti-inflammatory effects in the inflamed lung or exacerbates ongoing COVID-19 damage remains unclear. Therefore, we conclude that the available scientific evidence does not justify clinical trials of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia, with unknown benefit and known mortality risks from radiogenic cancer and circulatory disease. Despite the significant uncertainties in these proposals, some clinical trials are ongoing and planned. This paper gives an overview of current situations surrounding LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Salomaa, Sisko; Bouffler, Simon D; Atkinson, Michael J; Cardis, Elisabeth; Hamada, Nobuyuki",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09553002.2020.1786609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579043/,400

OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the knowledge about the clinical features, symptoms and differences between patients with COVID-19, SARS, influenza, and common cold. The research can help ear, nose and throat specialists and other health practitioners manage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The biomedical databases used in the study included PubMed and MEDLINE. Statistical analysis using the Z-score test assessed which symptoms were more characteristic of COVID-19 than other viral diseases. RESULTS Among individuals with COVID-19, the most frequently reported symptoms were cough (70%), fever (45%), muscular pain (29%), and headache (21%), whereas sore throat (12%), and rhinorrhea (4%) were observed at lower rates. Fever was identified as most frequent in COVID-19 (74%), appearing at a higher rate in those cases than in influenza (68%) or the common cold (40%) (p < 0.05). In comparison to other viral diseases, sore throat was rarely reported in COVID-19 and SARS (12% and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05). In influenza and common cold, a cough was identified in 93% and 80% of cases (p < 0.05). Headache, rhinorrhea, muscular pain, and sore throat were more common in influenza (91%, 91%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) and common cold (89%, 81%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) than in COVID-19 (21%, 4%, 29%, and 12%, respectively) and SARS (45%, 12%, 55%, and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05).

Similar to the ubiquitous adiabatic approximation of time-dependent density-functional theory, the static approximation, which substitutes a dynamical (i.e., frequency-dependent) kernel by its static limit, is usually enforced in most implementations of the BSE formalism. Here, going beyond the static approximation, we compute the dynamical correction of the electron-hole screening for molecular excitation energies, thanks to a renormalized first-order perturbative correction to the static BSE excitation energies. The present dynamical correction goes beyond the plasmon-pole approximation as the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction is computed exactly within the random-phase approximation. Our calculations are benchmarked against high-level (coupled-cluster) calculations, allowing one to assess the clear improvement brought by the dynamical correction for both singlet and triplet optical transitions.","Loos, Pierre-François; Blase, Xavier",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0023168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962392/,400

119537,Effect of tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure on expiratory time constants in experimental lung injury.,2016,"OBJECTIVES In microneurosurgery, the operating microscope plays a vital role. The classical neurosurgical operation is bimanual, i.e. the microsurgical instruments are operated with both hands. Often, operations have to be carried out in narrow corridors at the depth of several centimeters. With the current technology, the operator must manually adjust the field of view during surgery which poses a disruption in the operating flow. Until now, technical adjuncts existed in the form of a mouthpiece to move the stereo camera unit or voice commands and foot pedals to control other interaction tasks like optical configuration. However, these have not been widely adopted due to usability issues. This study tests two novel hands free interaction concepts based on head positioning and gaze tracking as an attempt to reduce the disruption during microneurosurgery and increase the efficiency of the user. METHODS Technical equipment included the Pentero 900 microscope, HTC Vive Pro, and an inbuilt 3D-printed target probe. 11 neurosurgeons including 7 residents and 4 consultants participated in the study. The tasks created for this study were with the intention to mimic real microneurosurgical tasks to maintain applicative accuracy while testing the interaction concepts. The tasks involved visualization system adjustment to the specific target and touching the target. The first trial was conducted in a Virtual Reality setting applying the novel hands free interaction concepts, and the second one was conducted performing the same tasks on a 3D-printed target probe using manual field of view adjustment. The subjects completed both trials with the same predetermined tasks, in order to validate the feasibility of the novel technology. The data collected for this study was obtained with the help of review protocols, detailed post-trial interviews, video and audio recordings, along with time measurements while performing the tasks. RESULTS The user study conducted at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, found that the gaze tracking and head positioning based microscope adjustment were 18% and 29% faster respectively than the classical bimanual adjustment of the microscope. Focused user interviews showed the user's proclivity for the new interaction concepts, as they offered minimal disruption between the simultaneous target selection and camera position adjustment. CONCLUSIONS The hands-free interaction concepts presented in this study demonstrated a more efficient execution of the microneurosurgical tasks than the classical manual microscope and were assessed to be more preferable by both residents and consultant neurosurgeons.","Khakhar, Rutvik; You, Fang; Chakkalakal, Denny; Dobbelstein, David; Picht, Thomas",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.12.092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385607/,400
121274,Dynamic changes in chest CT findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different disease stages: a multicenter study.,2021-01-01,"UNLABELLED Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute enterically transmitted hepatitis. In industrialized countries, it is a zoonotic disease, with swine being the major reservoir of human HEV contamination. The occurrence and severity of the disease are variable, with clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to self-limiting acute hepatitis, chronic infection, or fulminant hepatitis. In the absence of a robust cell culture system or small-animal models, the HEV life cycle and pathological process remain unclear. To characterize HEV pathogenesis and virulence mechanisms, a quantitative proteomic analysis was carried out to identify cellular factors and pathways modulated during acute infection of swine. Three groups of pigs were inoculated with three different strains of swine HEV to evaluate the possible role of viral determinants in pathogenesis. Liver samples were analyzed by a differential proteomic approach, two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, and 61 modulated proteins were identified by mass spectroscopy. The results obtained show that the three HEV strains replicate similarly in swine and that they modulate several cellular pathways, suggesting that HEV impairs several cellular processes, which can account for the various types of disease expression. Several proteins, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, apolipoprotein E, and prohibitin, known to be involved in other viral life cycles, were upregulated in HEV-infected livers. Some differences were observed between the three strains, suggesting that HEV's genetic variability may induce variations in pathogenesis. This comparative analysis of the liver proteome modulated during infection with three different strains of HEV genotype 3 provides an important basis for further investigations on the factors involved in HEV replication and the mechanism of HEV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for acute hepatitis, with clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to self-limiting acute hepatitis, chronic infection, or fulminant hepatitis. In industrialized countries, HEV is considered an emerging zoonotic disease, with swine being the principal reservoir for human contamination. The viral and cellular factors involved in the replication and/or pathogenesis of HEV are still not fully known. Here we report that several cellular pathways involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism or cell survival were modulated during HEV infection in the swine model. Moreover, we observed a difference between the different swine strains, suggesting that HEV's genetic variability could play a role in pathogenesis. We also identified some proteins known to be involved in other viral cycles. Our study provides insight into the mechanisms modulated during HEV infection and constitutes a useful reference for future work on HEV pathogenesis and virulence.","Rogée, Sophie; Le Gall, Morgane; Chafey, Philippe; Bouquet, Jérôme; Cordonnier, Nathalie; Frederici, Christian; Pavio, Nicole",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02208-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320303/,400

In adults, the combination of galactomannan (GM) and fungal DNA detection has proven to be beneficial in the diagnosis of IA. Data in purely pediatric cohorts are scarce. Here, we monitored 39 children shortly before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation twice weekly by use of a commercial GM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a PCR assay based on amplification of the pan-Aspergillus ITS1/5.8S ribosomal operon. In addition, clinical data were recorded and classification of IA was performed according to the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Among the 39 high-risk children, we identified 4 patients (10.3%) with probable and 2 (5.1%) with possible IA. All patients with probable IA were repeatedly positive for both tests (means of 9.5 and 6.8 positive GM and PCR samples, respectively), whereas both possible IA cases were detected by PCR. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 67% and 89% for GM and 100% and 63% for PCR. Positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 50% and 100% for GM and 27% and 100% for PCR. For the combined testing approach, both values were 100%. The number of positive samples seemed to be lower in patients undergoing antifungal therapy. Sporadically positive tests occurred in 12% (GM) and 42% (PCR) of unclassified patients. In summary, our data show that combined monitoring for GM and fungal DNA also results in a high diagnostic accuracy in pediatric patients. Future studies have to determine whether combined testing is suitable for early detection of subclinical disease and how antifungal prophylaxis impacts assay performance.","Loeffler, Juergen; Hafner, Julia; Mengoli, Carlo; Wirth, Clemens; Heussel, Claus Peter; Löffler, Claudia; White, P Lewis; Ullmann, Andrew J; Michel, Denise; Wiegering, Verena; Wölfl, Matthias; Schlegel, Paul Gerhardt; Einsele, Hermann; Springer, Jan; Eyrich, Matthias",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01682-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27795339/,400

Materials and Methods Trials were identified from the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) using the key words ""HNSCC"" and ""SOX2."" The overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DPS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were the primary outcome measures. Results We identified 371 articles, 9 articles 11 studies with a total number of 1334 cases were eligible for inclusion of this meta-analysis. The results showed that OS (DPS) in low-expression group was higher than that in high-expression group. However, the difference between the two groups was not significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [0.88, 1.91]; P = 0.18), and there was great statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 66%, P = 0.002). After subgroup analysis, the HR for OS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.34 (95% CI = [1.04, 1.74], P = 0.03), and the heterogeneity became acceptable (I2 = 32%, P = 0.16). The HR for DFS of the patients with reduced expression of SOX2 was 1.39 (95% CI = [1.00, 1.93]; P = 0.05). Conclusion The findings of this meta-analysis are indicative of that high SOX2 expression is a negative prognostic factor of HNSCC and exhibit both worse OS and DFS. However, the small sample size available for this systematic review limited the power of this quantitative meta-analysis. It may therefore be too early to place complete confidence in these results.","Li, Bo; Chen, Mei; Pan, Meng-Xiong",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-1482.189238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719247/,400

Neither vaccine nor an antiviral medication is available to treat dengue. This insists the need of drug discovery for dengue. In order to find a potent lead molecule, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is essential for dengue viral replication is chosen as a drug target. As Quercetin showed antiviral activity against several viruses, quercetin derivatives developed by combinatorial library synthesis and mined from PubChem databases were screened for a potent anti-dengue viral agent. Our study predicted Quercetin 3-(6″-(E)-p-coumaroylsophoroside)-7-rhamnoside as a dengue polymerase inhibitor. The results were validated by molecular dynamics simulation studies which reveal water bridges and hydrogen bonds as major contributors for the stability of the polymerase-lead complex. Interactions formed by this compound with residues Trp795, Arg792 and Glu351 are found to be essential for the stability of the polymerase-lead complex.

Methods An online, anonymous 20-question survey was purpose-designed, based on a validated vitamin D questionnaire. It was made available to staff for completion in one UK ambulance service between 16 June and 12 July 2020, resulting in a convenience sample of 354 responses. These were analysed using quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative (thematic) approaches. Results The cohort age range was 20 to 65+ years; 41% (n = 156) were male. Over half of respondents worked within emergency operational service delivery (57%; n = 219), but all key service roles were represented. Respondents reported to be predominantly 'White British' (92%; n = 352), but nine ethnic groups were included. According to the Fitzpatrick Scale, most staff described themselves as having a 'Medium, between white to moderate brown: sometimes mild burns, gradual tan' complexion (47%; n = 182) or 'White, Fair: usually burns, tans with difficulty' (32%; n = 124). The majority felt they got sufficient sunlight exposure when at home (66%; n = 253), but not at work (58%; n = 222). Typically, respondents stated they were 'neither unconcerned or concerned' about having vitamin D deficiency (35%; n = 135), although almost a fifth (17%; n = 66) reported to have been told they had vitamin D deficiency by a medical professional. Forty percent of respondents took vitamin D supplements: 12% (n = 45) as advised by a medical professional, and 28% (n = 107) self-directed to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Of the remaining, many (35%; n = 136) had not considered taking such dietary supplements. The ability of respondents to recognise known factors that affect vitamin D production in the skin, good vitamin D food sources and individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency was variable. Additional comments raised by respondents related to lack of vitamin D awareness, the risk factors and impact of deficiency, vitamin supplementation, COVID-19, work arrangements and sunlight exposure, self-learning and general well-being. Conclusion There is scope for improved awareness of vitamin D and the risks for deficiency in the ambulance setting. It appears service staff are at risk of vitamin D deficiency irrespective of their role: access to sunlight and use of vitamin D supplements are variable. The physical and mental impacts of deficiency can be significant, requiring absence from work. The development of appropriate vitamin D and well-being resources appears to be warranted.","Prothero, Larissa",British paramedic journal,https://doi.org/10.29045/14784726.2021.3.5.4.65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421381/,400

This study determined whether selective histopathological examination is safe. METHODS A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was performed. Pooled incidences of incidental and truly incidental GBC (GBC detected during histopathological examination without preoperative or intraoperative suspicion) were estimated using a random-effects model. The clinical consequences of truly incidental GBC were assessed. RESULTS Seventy-three studies (232 155 patients) were included. In low-incidence countries, the pooled incidence was 0·32 (95 per cent c.i. 0·25 to 0·42) per cent for incidental GBC and 0·18 (0·10 to 0·35) per cent for truly incidental GBC. Subgroup analysis of studies in which surgeons systematically examined the gallbladder revealed a pooled incidence of 0·04 (0·01 to 0·14) per cent. In high-incidence countries, corresponding pooled incidences were 0·83 (0·58 to 1·18), 0·44 (0·21 to 0·91) and 0·08 (0·02 to 0·39) per cent respectively. Clinical consequences were reported for 176 (39·3 per cent) of 448 patients with truly incidental GBC. Thirty-three patients (18·8 per cent) underwent secondary surgery. Subgroup analysis showed that at least half of GBC not detected during the surgeon's systematic examination of the gallbladder was early stage (T1a status or below) and of no clinical consequence. CONCLUSION Selective histopathological examination of the gallbladder after initial macroscopic assessment by the surgeon seems safe and could reduce costs.","Bastiaenen, V P; Tuijp, J E; van Dieren, S; Besselink, M G; van Gulik, T M; Koens, L; Tanis, P J; Bemelman, W A",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639049/,400

We describe a novel technique, using a step-by-step procedure, to overcome the pitfalls associated with the LAX-IP. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach. METHODS All operators underwent training before participation in this study. One hundred patients were enrolled in this study and underwent central venous catheterization using this method. Using a portable ultrasound and vein catheterization kit, patients were appropriately positioned and a straight portion of the vein identified (Step 1). A needle guide was used (Step 2) and the vein imaged in real time in two directions (Step 3), to identify the true long axis and prevent damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS The overall success rate for catheterization was 100% with a median of one puncture for each patient. All catheterizations were performed within three punctures. Problems with the first puncture included difficult insertion of the guide-wire due to coiling, difficult anterior wall puncture, less experience with the procedure, and other reasons. There were no complications associated with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS This three-step method is not dependent on an operator's ability to proceed based on spatial awareness, but rather depends on logic. This method can prevent difficulties associated with a two-dimensional ultrasound view, and may be a safer technique compared with others.

DESIGN Retrospective study approved By Committee For The Protection Of Human Subjects at University Of Texas Medical School at Houston. SETTING University-affiliated children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS The records of pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for electrophysiology procedures were analyzed. Electronic data collected included Bispectral Index (BIS) values, anesthetics (eg, opioids, expired concentration of inhaled anesthetics, muscle relaxants), hemodynamic values (ie, heart rate, invasive blood pressure), respiratory parameters [ie, tidal volume, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)], and routine arterial blood gases. These parameters were analyzed 10 minutes prior to the start of the isoproterenol infusion (T-pre) and 10 minutes after isoproterenol had reduced the cardiac cycle length by 20% (T-infusion). MAIN RESULTS Of the 29 records that were screened, 22 met the above criteria (mean age 13 ± 5 yrs). BIS values increased by an average of 8 (33 ± 8 to 41 ± 10; P < 0.001) during the isoproterenol infusion. Statistically significant increases in ETCO2 (median 33 - 36 mmHg; P = 0.01), PaCO2 (35 - 38 mmHg; P = 0.002), and lactate (1.1 -1.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) occurred with infusion of isoproterenol. Patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation showed an increase in ETCO2 (mean 34 ± 6 mmHg to 37 ± 5 mmHg; P = 0.001) whereas those breathing spontaneously had an increase in minute ventilation (average increase 111 ± 30 mL/kg). CONCLUSIONS Isoproterenol increases metabolic, respiratory, and BIS values in pediatric patients during general anesthesia. We recommend the use of BIS, close monitoring of ETCO2, and careful titration of anesthetics during isoproterenol infusion, especially when lighter planes of general anesthesia are requested for pediatric electrophysiologic procedures.","Gautam, Nischal K; Rafique, Muhammad B; Numan, Mohammed T",Journal of clinical anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2014.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439399/,400

The aim of the study was to assess the changes in pleural pressure amplitude (Pplampl) during the respiratory cycle and respiratory rate (RR) in patients undergoing pleural fluid withdrawal. METHODS The study included 23 patients with symptomatic pleural effusion. Baseline pleural pressure curves were registered with a digital electronic manometer. Then, the registrations were repeated after the withdrawal of consecutive portions of pleural fluid (200 ml up to 1000 ml and 100 ml above 1000 ml). In all patients the pleural pressure curves were analyzed in five points, at 0, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the relative volume of pleural effusion withdrawn in particular patients. RESULTS There were 11 and 12 patients with right sided and left sided pleural effusion, respectively (14 M, 9F, median age 68, range 46-85 years). The most common cause of pleural effusion were malignancies (20 pts., 87%). The median total volume of withdrawn pleural fluid was 1800 (IQR 1500-2400) ml. After termination of pleural fluid withdrawal Pplampl increased in 22/23 patients compared to baseline. The median Pplampl increased from 3.4 (2.4-5.9) cmH2O to 10.7 (8.1-15.6) cmH2O (p < 0.0001). Three patterns of Pplampl changes were identified. Although the patterns of RR changes were more diversified, a significant increase between RR at baseline and the last measurement point was found (p = 0.0097). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, therapeutic thoracentesis is associated with significant changes in Pplampl during the respiratory cycle. In the vast majority of patients Pplampl increased steadily during pleural fluid withdrawal. There was also an increase in RR.

142060,Sustained High D-Dimer in Outpatients Who Have Recovered from Mild to Moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND An association between relatively deep anesthesia, as guided by the bispectral index (BIS), and increased postoperative mortality has been demonstrated in 6 of 8 published observational studies, but association does not necessarily mean causality. Small clinical trials of anesthetic depth have demonstrated increased delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients who were relatively deeply anesthetized, but have been inadequately powered to study mortality. A large-scale randomized study is required to determine whether causality exists. METHODS The primary hypothesis of our study is that ""light"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 50, will reduce all-cause mortality within 1 year of surgery in comparison with ""deep"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 35, in patients aged ≥60 years presenting for major surgery under general anesthesia. The trial is an international multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind (patients and investigators) prospective, intention-to-treat, safety and efficacy study. The relative reduction in mortality in the light anesthesia group is expected to be 20%, giving an absolute risk reduction from 10% to 8%. Power analysis using a = 0.049 and b = 0.2 indicates that 3250 patients are required in each group. RESULTS The study is underway, and 1325 patients have been recruited in 40 centers in 5 countries. It is anticipated that the study will be completed in 3 years. CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled trial should definitively answer the question of whether titrating anesthetic depth makes a difference to patient outcome in a vulnerable patient group.","Short, Timothy G; Leslie, Kate; Chan, Matthew T V; Campbell, Douglas; Frampton, Christopher; Myles, Paul",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993386/,400
142630,Using a roller pump for establishing extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - technical considerations for times of crisis.,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke is a national, hospital-based quality improvement program developed by the American Heart Association. Although studies have suggested improved processes of care in GWTG-Stroke-participating hospitals, it is not known whether this improved care translates into improved clinical outcomes compared with nonparticipating hospitals. METHODS From all acute care US hospitals caring for Medicare beneficiaries with acute stroke between April 2003 and December 2008, we matched hospitals that joined the GWTG-Stroke program with similar hospitals that did not. Using a difference-in-differences design, we analyzed whether hospital participation in GWTG-Stroke was associated with a greater improvement in clinical outcomes compared with the underlying secular change. RESULTS The matching algorithm identified 366 GWTG-Stroke-adopting hospitals that cared for 88 584 acute ischemic stroke admissions and 366 non-GWTG-Stroke hospitals that cared for 85 401 acute ischemic stroke admissions. Compared with the Pre period (18-6 months before program implementation), in the Early period (0-6 months after program implementation), GWTG-Stroke hospitals had accelerated increases in discharge to home and reduced mortality at 30 days and 1 year. In the Sustained period (6-18 months after program implementation), the accelerated reduction in mortality at 1 year was sustained, with a trend toward sustained accelerated increase in discharge home. CONCLUSIONS Hospital adoption of the GWTG-Stroke program was associated with improved functional outcomes at discharge and reduced postdischarge mortality.","Song, Sarah; Fonarow, Gregg C; Olson, DaiWai M; Liang, Li; Schulte, Phillip J; Hernandez, Adrian F; Peterson, Eric D; Reeves, Mathew J; Smith, Eric E; Schwamm, Lee H; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27079809/,400

It was collected for all four seasons during 2014/15 in the suburban area of Belgrade (Serbia) and analysed for Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, As, Ba and Pb elements and for NH4+, NO3- and SO42- ions by particle-induced X-ray emission and ion chromatography techniques, respectively. Obtained concentrations have been treated by a combination of several receptor-oriented models to reveal source contributions to the suburban PM2.5 at different spatial scales. Applied positive matrix factorization analysis indicated five main groups of emission sources: biomass burning (14.5%), traffic (3.9%), regional combustion/secondary sulphates (28.8%), local combustion/secondary nitrates (29.7%) and soil (5.4%). Local heating units had been pointed out as dominant contributors by long-range transport and ground-wind circulation analyses. Air masses circulating over the Balkan Peninsula denoted regional emissions as responsible for the high concentrations of secondary sulphates. Local and long-range transport analyses combined suggested that the BB and the LC/NO3 originated from the wider urban area. Several Saharan dust episodes were detected as well.

However, the outcomes of previous studies are still confounding. This study reviewed the application of different types of barbed sutures in different surgeries. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing the application of barbed sutures up to Feb. 2015. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis was performed. Seventeen RCTs (low to moderate risk of bias) involving 1992 patients were included. Compared with conventional sutures, the barbed suture could reduce suture time (SMD=-0.95, 95%CI -1.43 to -0.46, P = 0.0001) and the operative time (SMD=-0.28, 95%CI -0.46 to -0.10, P = 0.003), not significantly increase the estimated blood loss (SMD=-0.09, 95%CI -0.52 to 0.35, P = 0.70), but could lead to more postoperative complications (OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.96, P = 0.03), These results varied in subgroups. Thus, barbed sutures are effective in reducing the suture and operative time, but the safety evidences are still not sufficient.

Rhesus theta defensin-1 (RTD-1) is a macrocyclic host defense peptide with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. Combined with favorable preclinical safety and peptide stability data, RTD-1 warrants investigation to determine its therapeutic potential for treatment of CF lung disease. We sought to evaluate the therapeutic potential of RTD-1 for CF airway infection and inflammation using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models. We evaluated RTD-1's effects on basal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced inflammation in CF sputum leukocytes and CF bronchial epithelial cells. Peptide stability was evaluated by incubation with CF sputum. Airway pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerance studies were performed in naive mice. Aerosolized RTD-1 treatment effects were assessed by analyzing lung bacterial burdens and airway inflammation using an established model of chronic P. aeruginosa endobronchial infection in CF (ΔF508) mice. RTD-1 directly reduces metalloprotease activity, as well as inflammatory cytokine secretion from CF airway leukocyte and bronchial epithelial cells. Intrapulmonary safety, tolerability, and stability data support the aerosol administration route. RTD-1 reduced the bacterial lung burden, airway neutrophils, and inflammatory cytokines in CF mice with chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Collectively, these studies support further development of RTD-1 for treatment of CF airway disease.","Bensman, Timothy J; Jayne, Jordanna G; Sun, Meiling; Kimura, Elza; Meinert, Joshua; Wang, Joshua C; Schaal, Justin B; Tran, Dat; Rao, Adupa P; Akbari, Omid; Selsted, Michael E; Beringer, Paul M",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00154-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559270/,400

We assembled a prospective cohort of patients. Preoperative variables were described, and 10 minutes after the surgical incision, bispectral index, mean alveolar concentration, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded. Bispectral index was classified as superficial (60), adequate (40-60), and deep (> 40). Mean alveolar concentration was classified as low (< 0.8), normal (0.8-1.2), and high (> 1.2). We included 50 patients. The mean age of the patients was 36.3 ± 13.5 years; 48% were male and 78% were categorized as ASA I. Mean values of mean alveolar concentration and bispectral index were 1.14 ± 0.18 and 38.66 ± 6.9, respectively. Frequency of anesthetic overdose measured with bispectral index was 54% and only 20% with mean alveolar concentration. In total, 78% of patients received normal mean alveolar concentration values, and among these patients, 49% had deep bispectral index levels and 51% were adequate. There was no correlation between mean alveolar concentration and bispectral index (Pearson r = 0.161, P = 0.246) or between bispectral index and mean arterial pressure (Pearson r = 0.367, P = 0.08). All patients older than 60 years exhibited deep bispectral index levels, and although we did not identify a correlation between age and bispectral index, a tendency was observed (Pearson r = -0.087, P = 0.538). Safe and effective anesthesia overdose could be a common phenomenon. Bispectral index-guided anesthesia could be a helpful and reliable tool in the assessment and prevention of anesthesia overdose at high altitude.

According to research, early prediction and prevention can effectively reduce the incidence rate of the disease. However, it is difficult to predict the ischaemic stroke because the data related to the disease are multi-modal. To achieve high accuracy of prediction and combine the stroke risk predictors obtained by previous researchers, a method for predicting the probability of stroke occurrence based on a multi-model fusion convolutional neural network structure is proposed. In such a way, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction is improved by processing multi-modal data through multiple end-to-end neural networks. In this method, the feature extraction of structured data (age, gender, history of hypertension, etc.) and streaming data (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) based on a convolutional neural network is first realized. A neural network model for feature fusion is then constructed to realize the feature fusion of structured data and streaming data. Finally, a predictive model for predicting the probability of stroke is obtained by training. As shown in the experimental results, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction reached 98.53%. Such a high prediction accuracy will be helpful for preventing the occurrence of stroke.","Liu, Yan; Yin, Bo; Cong, Yanping",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20174995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899242/,400

Recently, nasal pillows have been designed to overcome these issues. Limited evidence exists of the benefits and effectiveness of these devices. Twenty-one patients (19 male, 49±10years) with the established diagnosis of OSAS [apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI): 52±22] and who had a successful CPAP titration were commenced on CPAP therapy (10±2cmH2O), and randomized to 4weeks of a nasal pillow (P) and a standard nasal mask (M) in a crossover design. Outcome measures were objective compliance, AHI, quality of life, Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and CPAP side-effects. There was no difference in compliance (M versus P: 5.1±1.9h versus 5.0±1.7h; P=0.701) and AHI (2.6±2.7 versus 3.0±2.9; P=0.509). Quality of life and ESS improved with CPAP, but there was no difference in the extent of improvement between both devices. Usage of nasal pillows resulted in less reported pressure on the face and more subjects found the nasal pillow the more comfortable device. However, there was no clear overall preference for either device at the end of the study (mask=57%, pillow=43%; P=0.513). The applied CPAP pressure did not correlate with compliance, AHI and ESS. Furthermore, no differences in outcome parameters were noted comparing groups with CPAP pressure <10 and ≥10cm H(2) O. Nasal pillows are equally effective in CPAP therapy, but do not generally lead to improved compliance.","Ryan, Silke; Garvey, John F; Swan, Valerie; Behan, Renata; McNicholas, Walter T",Journal of sleep research,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2010.00873.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20673292/,400

METHODS This was an observational, longitudinal, and retrospective case series analysis. The study included 52 eyes from 52 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy with trypan blue-assisted internal limiting membrane peeling and 25% SF6 tamponade for stages 2, 3, and 4 macular holes. After surgery, all patients were provided with a postoperative postural regimen: 31 patients were instructed not to maintain face-down posturing, whereas 21 were instructed to maintain face-down posturing for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was the macular hole closure rate. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi Info 7.1. RESULTS A total of 47 (90.3%) patients achieved hole closure. The nonface-down posturing group and face-down posturing group obtained closure rates of 90.3% and 90.4%, respectively; these rates were not significantly different. Statistical analysis revealed that no significant differences existed in sex, age, hole duration, hole stage, preoperative visual acuity, or postoperative visual acuity between the two groups. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that macular hole surgery with the use of short duration gas (SF6) is safe and effective and that maintaining a postural orientation of nonface-down posturing is also safe. However, these recommendations should be assessed further in a prospective and randomized study to comprehensively delineate the associated benefits and risks.","Bastos, Andre Luis Carvalho de Moura; Ávila, Marcos Pereira de; Isaac, David Leonardo Cruvinel; Aguiar, Levy Paz; Aguiar, Aline Guerreiro",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20200044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084811/,400

Although pros and pro measures are known to have many important benefits, they are not consistently being used and there is there no Canadian pros oversight. The Position Statement presented here is the first step toward supporting the implementation of pros in the Canadian health care setting. Methods The Canadian pros National Steering Committee drafted position statements, which were submitted for stakeholder feedback before, during, and after the first National Canadian Patient Reported Outcomes (canpros) scientific conference, 14-15 November 2019 in Calgary, Alberta. In addition to the stakeholder feedback cycle, a patient advocate group submitted a section to capture the patient voice. Results The canpros Position Statement is an outcome of the 2019 canpros scientific conference, with an oncology focus. The Position Statement is categorized into 6 sections covering 4 theme areas: Patient and Families, Health Policy, Clinical Implementation, and Research. The patient voice perfectly mirrors the recommendations that the experts reached by consensus and provides an overriding impetus for the use of pros in health care. Conclusions Although our vision of pros transforming the health care system to be more patient-centred is still aspirational, the Position Statement presented here takes a first step toward providing recommendations in key areas to align Canadian efforts. The Position Statement is directed toward a health policy audience; future iterations will target other audiences, including researchers, clinicians, and patients.

Over a year ago most countries have closed their borders, put people under lockdown, and have been suspending people from work and travel. However, there are still many organizations that need to operate, especially hospitals, services industry, governments, etc. However, people cannot maintain social distancing which includes staying at least 1.5 2 meters from other people because they need to communicate with each other. As a result, this increases the infection of Covid-19. This work proposes a social distancing tracking tool in offices or indoor places.

Using data available up to 28 June 2021, the estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 1,750 to 4,600, implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down in March 2020 of at least 13 times the generally employed threshold figure of $62,000 for health interventions in New Zealand; the lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to the standard benchmark. Using only data available to the New Zealand government in March 2020, the ratio is similar and therefore the same conclusion holds that the nation-wide lockdown strategy was not warranted. Looking forwards from 28 June 2021, if a new outbreak occurs that cannot be suppressed without a nation-wide lockdown, the death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign and because the period over which the virus would then inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020; this would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020. This approach of assessing the savings in quality adjusted life years and comparing them to a standard benchmark figure ensures that all quality adjusted life years saved by various health interventions are treated equally, which accords with the ethical principle of equity across people.","Lally, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.15.21260606v1?rss=1,400
171033,Problems of autoimmunity and autoinflammation in rheumatology: Lessons from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19),2021,"IntroductionThe delivery of medical education has changed alongside the effects of COVID-19. As a result, the undergraduate psychiatry training for medical students at Guy’s King’s and St Thomas’ School of Medicine had to adapt rapidly. This poster portrays the journey in which the teaching sessions were developed and delivered throughout the first academic term of 2020-2021.ObjectivesTo deliver an interactive online teaching day that can provide students with the knowledge and understanding of common psychiatric disorders in the interface of other medical conditions.MethodsA clinical skills teaching day was developed to deliver the sessions via the online video calling platform Zoom. Published articles regarding online medical education as well as guidelines from the Royal College of Psychiatry were used as a resource to develop the structure. Feedback of the teaching day was collected via an anonymous survey.Results78 responses were collected in total from 4 teaching days. Overall satisfaction was high with a score of 86.5/100 in overall satisfaction. Themes for positive feedback included utilising actors in simulation (38% 30/78) and high interactivity within the teaching (31% 24/78). There were a number of students who found the whole day session online tiring (13% 10/78) and others felt the variation of scenarios were too limited (12% 9/78).ConclusionsAs lockdown has forced students to have less patient contact, they have suffered from the lack of learning opportunities. This teaching day showed the importance of organising high fidelity scenarios in order to try and fill the void that has been created due to COVID-19.","Fukutomi, A.; Bhamra, M.; Butler, S.; Wilson-Jones, C.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1589,400

We have demonstrated using a combination of molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations that marine fungi derivatives can be possible inhibitors, preventing the biological activity of Hsp90. The computational approaches were validated and compared with previous experiments. Based on the benchmark of available inhibitors of Hsp90, the GOLD docking package using the ChemPLP scoring function was found to be superior over both Autodock Vina and Autodock4 in the preliminary estimation of the ligand-binding affinity and binding pose with the Pearson correlation, R = -0.62. Moreover, FPL calculations were also indicated as a suitable approach to refine docking simulations with a correlation coefficient with the experimental data of R = -0.81. Therefore, the binding affinity of marine fungi derivatives to Hsp90 was evaluated. Docking and FPL calculations suggest that five compounds including 23, 40, 46, 48, and 52 are highly potent inhibitors for Hsp90. The obtained results enhance cancer therapy research.","Cao, D.

This paper investigates how hospital departments can leverage the ability of firms to simultaneously explore new IT resources and practices (IT exploration) as well as exploit their current IT resources and practices (IT exploitation), i.e., IT ambidexterity, to adequately sense and respond to patients' needs and demands, i.e., patient agility. This study embraces the dynamic capability view and develops a research model, and tests it accordingly using cross-sectional data from 90 clinical hospital departments from the Netherlands through an online survey. The model's hypothesized relationships are tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). The outcomes demonstrate the significance of IT ambidexterity in developing patient agility, positively influencing patient service performance. The study outcomes support the theorized model can the outcomes shed light on how to transform clinical practice and drive patient agility.","Wetering, R. v. d.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.20.21258538v1?rss=1,400

Here, we show that tumor-associated mutations create neomers, DNA sequences 11-18bp in length that are absent in the human genome, that can accurately detect cancer subtypes and features. We show that we can detect twenty-one different tumor-types with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods using a neomer-based classifier. Refinement of this classifier via supervised learning identified additional cancer features with even greater precision. We also demonstrate that neomers can precisely diagnose cancer from cfDNA in liquid biopsy samples. Finally, we show that neomers can be used to detect cancer-associated non-coding mutations affecting gene regulatory activity. Combined, our results identify a novel, sensitive, specific and straightforward cancer diagnostic tool.","Georgakopoulos-Soares, I.; Barnea, O.

Some ARI in adult patients may be caused by bacteria but most often the causes are virus infections. When ARI affect immunocompromised patients or the elderly the mortality rates are significantly higher than in immunocompetent individuals. Many types of viruses cause ARI. Among them, influenza viruses A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are thought to be the most important because of the severity of illness after infection and their high communicability in the human population. Recently, several novel antiviral drugs against ARI have been developed and some are proceeding in clinical trials. This review covers current investigations into antiviral compounds targeted at several points in the virus life-cycle. This includes PM-523, which broadly inhibits ortho- and paramyxo-viruses, two neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza virus, neutralizing antibody to RSV and chimeric soluble ICAM-1-IgA molecules targeted against rhinoviruses.","Shigeta, S",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9875381/,400

METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted in the clinical symptoms, physical signs and the results of laboratory examinations from 1170 cases with SARS in Beijing, and the clinical characteristics in different stages of the disease were compared. RESULTS The initial symptom of SARS was pyrexia and the temperature was > 38 degrees C. The natural course of fever was about 14 days. In almost all cases, the respiratory symptoms and systemic toxic manifestations were observed. They came to a climax at the second week and then decreased or nearly disappeared after the third week. The physical signs of SARS were not obvious. The moist rales were observed in 43.3% of patients. Hypoxemia was a common characteristic in SARS. The decrease in partial pressure of oxygen in artery and oxygen saturation in pulse oximeter with normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide was found in most patients at the second week. Abnormal chest X-ray including infiltration and consolidation shadows were seen in 100% of patients. The abnormal images could be found at the first day, enlarged during the second week (to a climax at the 8th or 9th day), and then recovered from the 2 week. The amounts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+), and CD(3)(+) of peripheral blood were decreased at the early stage and recovered after 2 or 3 weeks. Some patients suffered from temporary multiple organ dysfunctions (mainly impairments of liver and myocardium). CONCLUSION The main clinical manifestations of SARS included respiratory and systemic toxic symptoms. The typical course of the disease was about 4 weeks. The first week could be considered as early stage, the second week as fastigium stage, and from the next two weeks as recovery stage.","Xu, Han; Huangfu, Jing-kun; Li, Xing-wang; Xiao, Feng; Lü, Min; Wu, Yang-feng; Chen, Bo-wen; Han, De-min",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312432/,400
193311,Stroke as a complication of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2020-09-01,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest shock in decades to the well developed healthcare system and resources worldwide. Although there was a wide variation in the level of preparedness, the transition was tough even for the most renowned healthcare systems. Increasing the capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure. However, while the system is preoccupied with a pandemic infection, patients suffering from other illnesses are in high risk to get infected, also being compromised by the imperative shift in medical resources and significant restrictions on routine medical care. For example patients with cardiovascular disease and others referred for nuclear cardiology procedures are frequently greater than 60 years of age and have other comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic renal disease) that place them at a high-risk for adverse outcomes with COVID-19, providing unique challenges for their management in healthcare facilities, as well as for the care of health care personnel. Numerous medical specialty societies and governmental agencies issued guidelines aiming at the specification of preventive measures and amendments in everyday clinical practice during the escalation and peak of the pandemic. In accordance, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), issued a common statement in late March 2020, which was provided as an initial response to this pandemic, offering specific recommendations for adapting nuclear cardiology practices at each step in a patient's journey through the lab-for inpatients, outpatients and emergency department patients. One of the main recommendations was cancelling or delaying of all non-urgent nuclear cardiology studies. As COVID-19 follows a different time course in different geographic regions and lockdowns begin to lift in many countries, the issue of re-establishment of non-emergent care, in nuclear cardiology laboratories amongst others, has to be addressed in a watchful and balanced way, keeping in mind that the COVID-19 crisis is far from over. Furthermore measuring what is happening in the current crisis is essential to ensuring preparedness for a possible next wave of the pandemic. Recently the ASNC, SNMMI, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), issued an information statement which describes a careful approach to reestablishment of non-emergent care in nuclear cardiology laboratories reflecting diverse settings from the United States and worldwide. In the same spirit it is also the reintroduction guidance issued by North American Cardiovascular Societies. In this paper we provide a synopsis of the basic steps of adapting nuclear cardiology practice in the era of COVID-19 in order to balance between the risk of viral transmission while also providing crucial cardiovascular assessments for our patients.","Paschali, Anna; Anagnostopoulos, Constantinos",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862211/,400

Orthopaedic surgeons have a substantial occupational risk of contracting a blood-borne infection because of frequent handling of sharp instruments and objects during operative procedures. Aerosolization means the formation of aerosols and droplets when blood or other body fluids are mechanically disturbed. Smaller particles (<5 microm) will remain suspended in air. Pathogens that can survive in these small airborne particles may cause infection if they are inhaled. Aerosol-generating procedures in patients with tuberculosis or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may facilitate airborne transmission.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether viral infection in acute asthma was associated with increased sputum neutrophil degranulation and increased cellular lysis and whether these changes are related to clinical severity. Adults (n=49) presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma were examined for infection by means of sputum direct-fluorescence antigen detection, sputum culture, and sputum polymerase chain reaction for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Legionella pneumophila, and all common respiratory viruses. Subjects infected with one of these agents were classed as having an infective exacerbation. Spirometry and sputum induction were performed on presentation and 4-5 weeks later. Thirty-seven subjects (76%) had virus infection and acute asthma. Those with virus infection had increased sputum neutrophils (p<0.05) and increased neutrophil elastase (p<0.05), this was related to increased elevated sputum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Subjects with noninfective asthma had an increase in the proportion of sputum eosinophils. Both groups had elevated sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) concentrations. Higher levels of sputum LDH and ECP were associated with a longer hospital stay. Virus infection and acute asthma is associated with neutrophilic inflammation, cell lysis and more severe clinical disease.","Wark, P A B; Johnston, S L; Moric, I; Simpson, J L; Hensley, M J; Gibson, P G",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11852895/,400

199909,Human immunodeficiency virus and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes an upper respiratory tract disease in chickens and is highly contagious. Many different types of the virus exist, but only a few types are used as attenuated live vaccines in the commercial poultry industry. Of the vaccine types used, the Arkansas (Ark)-type virus is most frequently reisolated from vaccinated broilers. Previous research has suggested that incomplete clearance of Ark-type vaccine virus plays a role in the inadequate protection observed when vaccinated broilers are challenged with pathogenic Ark virus. In this study, we examine routes of vaccine administration using multiple IBV types including Ark in an effort to understand why Ark vaccines do not provide good protection and persist in commercial broilers. We found that interference between different types of IBV vaccines was not occurring when combined and administered using a commercial hatchery spray cabinet. Also, Ark vaccine virus was not efficacious in 1-day-old broilers when sprayed using a hatchery spray cabinet, but it gave good protection when administrated by eyedrop inoculation. We also found that the amount of Ark vaccine virus was low or undetectable in choanal swabs out to 35 days postvaccination when vaccine was administered by eyedrop or drinking water. Alternatively, a subpopulation of the Ark vaccine isolated from a vaccinated bird, Ark-RI-EP1, showed a peak titer at 7-10 days of age when given by the same routes, suggesting that the Ark-RI-EP1 was more fit with regard to infection, replication in the birds, or both. Moreover, we found that detection of IBV vaccine virus early after administration, regardless of strain or route, correlated with protection against homologous challenge and may thus be a good indicator of vaccine efficacy in the field because humoral antibody titers are typically low or undetectable after vaccination. These experiments provided key findings that can be used to direct efforts for improving the efficacy of IBV Ark-type vaccines given in the hatchery. They also elucidated factors contributing to the persistence of Ark vaccine in the field.","Roh, Ha-Jung; Hilt, Deborah A; Williams, Susan M; Jackwooda, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689182/,400

Recent reports have raised the alarm for invasive ROCM associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune cell dysregulation, cytokine dysregulation, and is associated with invasive fungal infections. Immunosuppressive treatment of COVID-19 with corticosteroids increases the risk of opportunistic infection. We present a series of 3 cases of invasive ROCM with different outcomes in immunocompetent nondiabetic patients who all received corticosteroids at doses higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization, and who received oxygen during their SARS-CoV-2 treatment course. Immune dysregulatory effects of COVID-19 and high-dose corticosteroids may both have caused predisposition to ROCM in these cases. Additionally, health system stress caused by responding to COVID-19 surges may have predisposed patients to exposure to mucormycosis-causing fungi through use of non-sterilized water for oxygen humidification. In light of these cases, we encourage guideline-based corticosteroid dosing in the management of COVID-19 as well as vigilance for invasive mucormycosis and prompt treatment in corticosteroid-treated patients.","Elhamamsy, Salaheldin; Bayer, Tom; Al-Kaffas, Mai; Hatahet, Sarah; Grover, Mohnish; Samdhani, Sunil; Nanda, Aman; Gravenstein, Stefan",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582509/,400

Previous coronavirus outbreaks led to worsened symptoms amongst pregnant women, suggesting that pregnant women are at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to investigate the differences in clinical presentation, management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in pregnant and non-pregnant women. METHODS: We ran a search on electronic databases and analysis of the relevant articles was done using Revie Manager 5.4. RESULTS: The review consists of nine studies comprising 591,058 women (28,797 pregnant and 562,261 non-pregnant), with most of the data derived from two large studies. The risk of experiencing fever (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64-0.85), headache (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.74-0.79), myalgia (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89-0.95), diarrhea (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.39-0.43), chest tightness (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77-0.95), and expectoration (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21-0.97) were greater amongst non-pregnant COVID-19-infected women.

However, the impact of COVID-19 on platelet activity, aggregation and agglutination still needs to be clarified. We measured total levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vWF binding to the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) complex (GPIb-IX-V), in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our Institution. Moreover, we evaluated platelet aggregation in response to agonists (ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid) and platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin. We found that levels of vWF antigen and the active form of vWF binding to platelets (vWF:RCo), were markedly increased in these patients. These results were associated with higher agglutination rates induced by ristocetin, thereby indirectly indicating an increased capability of vWF to bind to platelets. Conversely, we found that platelet aggregation in response to both ADP and collagen was lower in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy volunteers. This study shows that COVID-19 is associated with increased vWF-induced platelet agglutination but reduced platelet responsivity to aggregation stimuli. Our findings have translational relevance since platelet adhesion to vWF may represent a marker to predict possible complications and better delineate therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 patients.","Ruberto, Franco; Chistolini, Antonio; Curreli, Mariaignazia; Frati, Giacomo; Marullo, Antonino G M; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; Sciarretta, Sebastiano; Miraldi, Fabio; Alessandri, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Barone, Francesco; Santoro, Cristina; Alvaro, Domenico; Pugliese, Francesco; Pulcinelli, Fabio M",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,400

215581,Maintaining Hemostasis and Preventing Thrombosis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Part II,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study are to determine efficacy of Siddha medicine, Kabasura kudineer in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and reducing the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic COVID-19 when compared to Vitamin C and Zinc (CZ) supplementation. In addition, the trial will examine the changes in the immunological markers of the Siddha medicine against control. The secondary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety of the Siddha medicine and to document clinical profile of asymptomatic COVID-19 as per principles of Siddha system of Medicine. TRIAL DESIGN: A single centre, open-label, parallel group (1:1 allocation ratio), exploratory randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Cases admitted at non-hospital settings designated as COVID Care Centre and managed by the State Government Stanley Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India will be recruited. Eligible participants will be those tested positive for COVID-19 by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) aged 18 to 55 years without any symptoms and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension and bronchial asthma. Those pregnant or lactating, with severe respiratory disease, already participating in COVID trials and with severe illness like malignancy will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Adopting traditional methods, decoction of Kabasura kudineer will be prepared by boiling 5g of KSK powder in 240 ml water and reduced to one-fourth (60ml) and filtered. The KSK group will receive a dose of 60ml decoction, orally in the morning and evening after food for 14 days. The control group will receive Vitamin C (60000 IU) and Zinc tablets (100mg) orally in the morning and evening respectively for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR] from the baseline to that of seventh day of the treatment, prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state (clinical symptoms like fever, cough and breathlessness) and changes in the immunity markers [Interleukins (IL) 6, IL10, IL2, Interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha]. Clinical assessment of COVID-19 as per standard Siddha system of medicine principles and the occurrence of adverse effects will be documented as secondary outcomes. RANDOMISATION: The assignment to the study or control group will be allocated in equal numbers through randomization using random number generation in Microsoft Excel by a statistician who is not involved in the trial. The allocation scheme will be made by an independent statistician using a sealed envelope.

To this end, herein we prepared highly luminescent quantum dot nanobeads (QBs) by embedding numerous quantum dots into polymer matrix, and then applied it as a signal-amplification label in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). After covalently linkage with the expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RSSP), the synthesized QBs were used to determine the total antibody levels in sera by virtue of a double-antigen sandwich immunoassay. Under the developed condition, the QB-LFIA can allow the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies within 15 min with about one order of magnitude improvement in analytical sensitivity compared to conventional gold nanoparticle-based LFIA. In addition, the developed QB-LFIA performed well in clinical study in dynamic monitoring of serum antibody levels in the whole course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we successfully developed a promising fluorescent immunological sensing tool for characterizing the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirming the acquired immunity to COVID-19 by evaluating the SRAS-CoV-2 total antibody level in the crowd.","Zhou, Yaofeng Chen Yuan Liu Wenjuan Fang Hao Li Xiangmin Hou Li Liu Yuanjie Lai Weihua Huang Xiaolin Xiong Yonghua",Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical,,400

It is well known that host genetic factors account for the individual differences in the susceptibility to infectious diseases. The genetic susceptibility factors to COVID-19 and its severity are associated with several unanswered questions. However, the experience gained from an earlier strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, which shows 78% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and uses the same receptor to bind to host cells, could provide some clues. It, therefore, seems possible to assemble new evidence in order to solve a potential genetic predisposition puzzle for COVID-19.

METHOD: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). LIMITATIONS: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. CONCLUSION: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.","Serrano-Ripoll, Maria J; Meneses-Echavez, Jose F; Ricci-Cabello, Ignacio; Fraile-Navarro, David; Fiol-deRoque, Maria A; Pastor-Moreno, Guadalupe; Castro, Adoración; Ruiz-Pérez, Isabel; Zamanillo Campos, Rocío; Gonçalves-Bradley, Daniela C",J Affect Disord,,400

The overall reliability of the new definition for chronic ultrasound changes in longstanding GCA of the AA was good to excellent with Light's kappa values of 0.79-0.80 for inter-reader reliability and mean Light's-kappa of 0.88 for intra-reader reliability. The mean inter-rater and intra-rater agreements were 86-87% and 92%, respectively. Good reliabilities were observed comparing the vessels with longstanding versus acute GCA with a mean agreement and kappa values of 81% and 0.63, respectively. CONCLUSION: The new OMERACT ultrasound definition for chronic vasculitis of the AA in GCA revealed a good to excellent inter- and intra-reader reliability in a web-based exercise of experts.","Schäfer, Valentin Sebastian; Chrysidis, Stavros; Schmidt, Wolfgang A; Duftner, Christina; Iagnocco, Annamaria; Bruyn, George A; Carrara, Greta; De Miguel, Eugenio; Diamantopoulos, Andreas P; Nielsen, Berit Dalsgaard; Fredberg, Ulrich; Hartung, Wolfgang; Hanova, Petra; Hansen, Ib Tønder; Hocevar, Alojzija; Juche, Aaron; Kermani, Tanaz A; Lorenzen, Tove; Macchioni, Pierluigi; Milchert, Marcin; Døhn, Uffe Møller; Mukhtyar, Chetan; Monti, Sara; Ponte, Cristina; Scirè, Carlo A; Terslev, Lene; Dasgupta, Bhaskar; Keen, Helen I; Pineda, Carlos; Dejaco, Christian",Semin. arthritis rheum,,400

METHODS: 204 elderly patients (&#8805;60 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 31st to February 20th, 2020 were included in this study. Clinical endpoint was in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most common coexisting conditions. 76 patients died in the hospital. Multivariate analysis showed that dyspnea (hazards ratio (HR) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.414-3.517; p < 0.001), older age (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.070-1.123; p < 0.001), neutrophilia (HR 4.4, 95% CI 1.310-15.061; p = 0.017) and elevated ultrasensitive cardiac troponin I (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.471-10.433; p = 0.006) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSION: Although so far the overall mortality of COVID-19 is relatively low, the mortality of elderly patients is much higher.

Red flags can indicate the presence of serious pathology but are notoriously unreliable. This leaves diagnosis heavily reliant on diagnostic investigations which are generally a finite resource within healthcare organisations. The COVID pandemic seems to have further compounded the problem and the possibility of 'missed' or 'delayed' diagnosis is ever-present. This may present a threat to patients' lives, to clinicians' careers and wellbeing, and to organisations' finances and reputations. Although clinical risk in musculoskeletal physiotherapy may never be eliminated, there are opportunities to work towards minimising it. This professional issue will explore the complex problem of identifying serious pathology in musculoskeletal care and will propose strategies to manage the associated risks during the COVID pandemic and beyond.

Despite his recommendation to remove the water pump handle and thus reduce the spread of cholera, his theory of faecal-oral transmission was not widely believed until after his death. Furthermore, he also pioneered substantial achievements in the development of anaesthesia. He studied both chloroform and ether, improving the accuracy of their delivery. In his obstetric practice, he achieved the feat of obtaining satisfactory analgesia with a safer technique and is remembered for administering chloroform to Queen Victoria, during the delivery of her last two children. There are several interesting and unusual memorials to Snow, ranging from replica water pumps, blue plaques and a public house named after him. The most recent new memorial was erected in 2017, in his home town of York, which commemorates his origins and his subsequent contribution to curbing the cholera outbreak. All the memorials commemorate his achievements, which remain relevant today.

Based on subjective impressions and anecdotal evidence, Austrian public and private life came to a sudden halt. Here we assess the effect of the lock-down quantitatively for all regions in Austria and present an analysis of daily changes of human mobility throughout Austria using near-real-time anonymized mobile phone data. We describe an efficient data aggregation pipeline and analyze the mobility by quantifying mobile-phone traffic at specific point of interest (POI), analyzing individual trajectories and investigating the cluster structure of the origin-destination graph. We found a reduction of commuters at Viennese metro stations of over 80\% and the number of devices with a radius of gyration of less than 500 m almost doubled. The results of studying crowd-movement behavior highlight considerable changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a higher modularity and an increase from 12 to 20 detected communities. We demonstrate the relevance of mobility data for epidemiological studies by showing a significant correlation of the outflow from the town of Ischgl (an early COVID-19 hotspot) and the reported COVID-19 cases with an 8-day time lag. This research indicates that mobile phone usage data permits the moment-by-moment quantification of mobility behavior for a whole country. We emphasize the need to improve the availability of such data in anonymized form to empower rapid response to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Heiler, Georg; Reisch, Tobias; Hurt, Jan; Forghani, Mohammad; Omani, Aida; Hanbury, Allan; Karimipour, Farid",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10064v1.pdf,400

242352,Pulmonary embolism in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: a narrative review,2020,"The importance of emotions in service and product design is well known. Despite this, however, it is still not very well understood how users' emotions can be incorporated in a product or service lifecycle. In this paper, we argue that this gap is due to a lack of a methodological framework for an effective investigation of the emotional response of persons when using products and services. Indeed, the emotional response of users is generally investigated by means of methods (e.g., surveys) that are not effective for this purpose. In our view, Virtual Reality (VR) technologies represent the perfect medium to evoke and recognize users' emotional response, as well as to prototype products and services (and, for the latter, even deliver them). In this paper, we first provide our definition of emotion-driven services, and then we propose a novel methodological framework, referred to as the Virtual-Reality-Based Emotion-Elicitation-Emotion-Recognition loop (VEE-loop), that can be exploited to realize it. Specifically, the VEE-loop consists in a continuous monitoring of users' emotions, which are then provided to service designers as an implicit users' feedback. This information is used to dynamically change the content of the VR environment (VE), until the desired affective state is solicited. Finally, we discuss issues and opportunities of this VEE-loop, and we also present potential applications of the VEE-loop in research and in various application areas.","Andreoletti, Davide; Luceri, Luca; Leidi, Tiziano; Peternier, Achille; Giordano, Silvia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13407v1.pdf,400

These dentists have the academic route as well, but similar to the registration route, it is not easy and very competitive and expensive.

245719,The Psychological Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Nurses in Saudi Arabia and Their Coping Strategies,2021,"Widespread diagnostic testing is needed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and manage the pandemic. Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG Processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD is 300 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium, is compatible with heat treatment of saliva, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using AG processing with direct RT-qPCR provides a reliable and scalable diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can be integrated into a range of workflows, including automated settings.","Chomczynski, Piotr; Chomczynski, Peter W; Kennedy, Amy; Rymaszewski, Michal; Wilfinger, William W; Heiny, Judith A; Mackey, Karol",PLoS One,,400

While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.","Pohl, Marie O; Busnadiego, Idoia; Kufner, Verena; Glas, Irina; Karakus, Umut; Schmutz, Stefan; Zaheri, Maryam; Abela, Irene; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael; Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G",PLoS Biol,,400
247864,A meta-analysis for Lianhua Qingwen on the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"Modern scientific workflows are data-driven and are often executed on distributed, heterogeneous, high-performance computing infrastructures. Anomalies and failures in the workflow execution cause loss of scientific productivity and inefficient use of the infrastructure. Hence, detecting, diagnosing, and mitigating these anomalies are immensely important for reliable and performant scientific workflows. Since these workflows rely heavily on high-performance network transfers that require strict QoS constraints, accurately detecting anomalous network performance is crucial to ensure reliable and efficient workflow execution. To address this challenge, we have developed X-FLASH, a network anomaly detection tool for faulty TCP workflow transfers. X-FLASH incorporates novel hyperparameter tuning and data mining approaches for improving the performance of the machine learning algorithms to accurately classify the anomalous TCP packets. X-FLASH leverages XGBoost as an ensemble model and couples XGBoost with a sequential optimizer, FLASH, borrowed from search-based Software Engineering to learn the optimal model parameters. X-FLASH found configurations that outperformed the existing approach up to 28\%, 29\%, and 40\% relatively for F-measure, G-score, and recall in less than 30 evaluations. From (1) large improvement and (2) simple tuning, we recommend future research to have additional tuning study as a new standard, at least in the area of scientific workflow anomaly detection.","Tu, Huy; Papadimitriou, George; Kiran, Mariam; Wang, Cong; Mandal, Anirban; Deelman, Ewa; Menzies, Tim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12221v1.pdf,400

249598,The fatal cholera like diarrhoea in coronavirus disease 2019(Covid-19)-a rare case report in toddler,2020,"In November 2009, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first noticed in the city of Wuhan in China, rapidly spreading to assume pandemic proportions within a short period of time. The disease was subsequently designated as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The death toll has continued to rise with grave health and socio-economic implications for individuals, families and nations globally. Although the respiratory tract is primarily involved in this disease, kidney affectation is increasingly reported and has been shown to worsen the prognosis of the disease. Current evidence shows that kidney disease is not uncommon in patients with coronavirus infection especially in those with COVID-19 and may arise from a constellation of factors such as hypotension, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ failure, use of nephrotoxic medications as well as direct infection in some cases. Factors associated with acute kidney injury in coronavirus infected patients may include elderly age, male sex, presence of co-morbidities as well as pre-existing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease. Although, there is presently no effective treatment for COVID-19, there is room for conservative management, extracorporeal therapy and renal replacement therapy. The aim of this review was to integrate current and emerging evidences on renal disease resulting from COVID-19 and the previous epidemics of coronavirus infections including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by other strains of the virus.","Egbi, Oghenekaro Godwin; Adejumo, Oluseyi Ademola; Akinbodewa, Ayodeji Akinwumi",Pan Afr Med J,,400

Knowledge about the influence of baseline clinical and analytical factors on therapy outcomes is scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving 119 previously treated or untreated mUC patients under anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in a real-world scenario. The objectives of this study were to confirm the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy and to identify pretreatment factors influencing therapy outcomes. In addition, an independent prognostic model for overall survival (OS) was developed and internally validated. RESULTS: Median OS was 7.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4-10.4], median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.80 months (95% CI, 2.4-3.4), disease control rate (DCR) was 40% (95% CI, 31-49), and overall response rate (ORR) was 24% (95% CI, 15-31). Presence of peritoneal metastases was associated with poor OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.40, 95% CI, 1.08-5.33; P = 0.03]. Use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) was associated with poor OS (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.11-3.02; P = 0.02) and PFS (HR = 1.94, 95% CI, 1.22-3.09; P = 0.005), and lower DCR (OR = 0.38, 95% CI, 0.17-0.89; P = 0.03) and ORR (OR = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-1.60; P = 0.002). The three risk category prognostic model developed included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, PPI use, albumin level, presence of liver metastases, and presence of peritoneal metastases variables and was associated with higher risk of death (HR = 3.00, 95% CI, 1.97-4.56; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy as a safe and effective treatment option in daily clinical practice for mUC patients. It also describes the presence of peritoneal metastases as an independent prognostic factor for OS and underlines the association between PPI use and worse therapeutic outcomes. Finally, it proposes a new easy-to-use risk-assessment model for OS prediction.","Ruiz-Bañobre, J; Molina-Díaz, A; Fernández-Calvo, O; Fernández-Núñez, N; Medina-Colmenero, A; Santomé, L; Lázaro-Quintela, M; Mateos-González, M; García-Cid, N; López-López, R; Vázquez, S; Anido-Herranz, U",ESMO Open,,400

Due to this unprecedented situation, school education has since shifted to a heavy reliance on various forms of remote learning, and teachers and students have been forced to practice completely new ways of teaching and learning. Virtual learning requires students to draw from a different skill set than what is used in face-to-face settings, such as self-regulation for navigating online learning, or balancing learning and life at home. These new and challenging experiences coincide with limited opportunities for social engagement and an increased potential for isolation. These factors are continuing to contribute to children experiencing high levels of stress as the sense of normalcy is lost from their lives and they are bombarded with new expectations and responsibilities. Children need social and emotional support now more than ever. In this paper, we discuss how integrating Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) in daily lessons can benefit children now working in virtual settings, with sample activities organized around cognitive regulation, emotional regulation, and social skills. We address both explicit SEL instruction methodologies and ongoing teaching practices designed to promote SEL.","Kamei, Ai Harriott Wendy",International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education,,400

To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients. However, the benefits of probiotics are strain-specific, and it is necessary to identify the bacterial strains that are scientifically established to be beneficial.","Mirzaei, Rasoul; Attar, Adeleh; Papizadeh, Saher; Jeda, Ali Salimi; Hosseini-Fard, Seyed Reza; Jamasbi, Elaheh; Kazemi, Sima; Amerkani, Saman; Talei, Gholam Reza; Moradi, Pouya; Jalalifar, Saba; Yousefimashouf, Rasoul; Hossain, Mohammad Akhter; Keyvani, Hossein; Karampoor, Sajad",Arch. virol,,400

252014,Characteristics and Effectiveness of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Prevention and Control in a Representative City in China,2020,"Introduction: In this study, we aimed to detect anxiety levels of the physicians during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess the knowledge, perspective, and willingness of the physicians about telemedicine. Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002). Conclusion: About half of our physicians had different levels of anxiety during the pandemic, and this anxiety seemed to be more related to infecting their relatives. Participants thought that providing health care services with telemedicine during the pandemic period would be beneficial and reduce the spread of hospital-acquired COVID-19. However, there was no consensus among the participants regarding the use of telemedicine in the postpandemic period.","Demirgan, Serdar; Kargi Gemici, Ezgi; Çagatay, Melike; Altinel, Yüksel; Demirgan, Ebru Burcu; Güneyli, Hasan Cem; Sevdi, Mehmet Salih; Selcan, Aysin",Telemed. j. e. health,,400

255390,Risk factors for mortality in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bolivia: An analysis of the first 107 confirmed cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk of mortality is of vital importance for appropriate clinical decision making and delivering optimal treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a clinical risk score for predicting mortality at the time of admission of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively. If the model was optimized for > 90% sensitivity, accuracies were 81.0% and 80.2% with sensitivities of 91.7% and 86.1% in the development and validation set, respectively. The optimized scoring system has been applied to the public online risk calculator (https://www.diseaseriskscore.com). CONCLUSION: This clinically developed and validated COVID-Mortality Score, using clinical data available at the time of admission, will aid clinicians in predicting in-hospital mortality.","Her, Ae Young; Bhak, Youngjune; Jun, Eun Jung; Yuan, Song Lin; Garg, Scot; Lee, Semin; Bhak, Jong; Shin, Eun Seok",J Korean Med Sci,,400

COVID-19 rapidly spread and attacked people in more than 200 countries worldwide. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has become urgent to prevent the exacerbation of the astounding spread of this pernicious disease. This paper presents a novel rapid deep learning computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework for simultaneously detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 against different respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, infiltration, mass, pneumothorax, nodule, and effusion. To develop a useful patient triage system for detecting COVID-19 in early-stage, rapidly extract the visual diagnosis knowledge from the input chest X-ray (CXR) images is extremely required. The proposed CAD framework shows its capability to automatically detect and diagnose COVID-19 with a detection accuracy of 96.31% and a classification accuracy of 97.40%. Meanwhile, the real-time prediction speed of 0.0093 seconds is achieved for a single testing CXR image. To achieve a high accuracy of the knowledge extraction from the entire CXR images with a high prediction speed would represent a key for developing a comprehensive and useful smart patient triage system in hospitals and healthcare systems. © 2021 IEEE.","Al-Antari, M.

Viral tissue tropism is an active area of investigation, one approach to which is identification of virus within tissues by electron microscopy of post-mortem and surgical specimens. Most diagnostic histopathologists have limited understanding of the ultrastructural features of normal cell trafficking pathways, which can resemble intra- and extracellular coronavirus; in addition, viral replication pathways make use of these trafficking pathways. Herein, we review these pathways and their ultrastructural appearances, with emphasis on structures which may be confused with coronavirus. In particular, we draw attention to the fact that, when using routine fixation and processing, the typical 'crown' that characterises a coronavirus is not readily identified on intracellular virions, which are located in membrane-bound vacuoles. In addition, the viral nucleocapsid is seen as black dots within the virion and is more discriminatory in differentiating virions from other cellular structures. The identification of the viral replication organelle, a collection of membranous structures (convoluted membranes) seen at a relatively low scanning power, may help to draw attention to infected cells, which can be sparse. © 2020 The Authors.

Healthy young and older adults provided similarity judgments for pairs of face images. Facial shape and surface features were subsequently derived and combined into image reconstructions of facial appearance. Both objective and experimental evaluations revealed that reconstructions were successful for every participant. Critically, shape and surface properties, such as eye shape and skin tone, were less accurately represented in older than young individuals. Yet, age-related differences in face representations, though significant, were less pronounced than those due to individual variability. Our results provide novel insights into age-related changes in visual perception and demonstrate the utility of image reconstruction to uncovering internal representations across a variety of populations.

METHODS: In our intensive care unit (ICU), 55 patients (46 male, median age 61 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (35 = 63.6% on mechanical ventilation, 7 = 14.5% on high-flow nasal oxygen, 12 = 20% on non-invasive ventilation, 1 = 1.8% without respiratory support) were treated with high-titre CP (200 mL per dose, range 1-6 doses, median 3 doses per patient, minimum titre > 1:100, Wantai test). 139 COVID-19 patients treated in the same ICU who did not receive CP served as control group. In 27 patients, the effect of CP on the individual levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was assessed by ELISA in serum sample pairs collected before and after CP transfusion. RESULTS: The first CP dose was administered at a median of 8 days after symptom onset. 13 patients in the plasma cohort died (28-day mortality 24.1%), compared to 42 (30.2%) in the cohort who did not receive CP (p = 0.5, Pearson Chi-squared test). Out of the 27 individuals investigated for the presence of IgG antibodies, 8 did not have detectable IgG levels before the first CP transfusion. In this subpopulation, 3 patients (37.5%) died. Not a single confirmed adverse reaction to CP was noted. CONCLUSIONS: While adjunctive treatment with CP for severe and life-threatening COVID-19 was a very safe intervention, we did not observe any effect on mortality.","Hoepler, Wolfgang Paul; Weidner, Lisa; Traugott, Marianna Theresia; Neuhold, Stephanie; Meyer, Elias Laurin; Zoufaly, Alexander; Seitz, Tamara; Kitzberger, Reinhard; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Pawelka, Erich; Karolyi, Mario; Grieb, Alexander; Hind, Julian; Laferl, Hermann; Friese, Emanuela; Wenisch, Christoph; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Aberle, Judith Helene; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Jungbauer, Christoph",Infect Dis (Lond),,400

264134,Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Practice of Clinical Radiology,2020,"Understanding the thermal ecology of active amphibians, as well as its relationship with habitat and environmental features, is a central theme in ecology. However, this topic has been poorly studied in eastern Himalaya, which is a global biodiversity hotspot. To bridge this gap, we investigated how the body temperatures of active amphibians varied along an elevation gradient in the Arun and Tamor River catchments in eastern Nepal Himalaya in the present study. Amphibian assemblages were sampled from May to July in both 2014 and 2015 using nocturnal time-constrained visual encounter surveys, and the body temperature of each individual was directly measured using a digital infrared thermometer in the field. A combination of linear regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses was used to determine the effects of elevation and environmental variables on the body temperatures of active amphibians. In total, the body temperatures of 599 amphibian individuals belonging to 28 species from six families were recorded. Our results indicated that amphibian body temperature exhibited monotonically declining trends with increasing elevations in eastern Nepal Himalaya. Interestingly, this tread was much more pronounced in subtropical (lowland) areas than in warm and cool temperate regions. Inter- and intraspecies variations in body temperature were large, which can be attributed to distinct habitat utilization among species and the change in vegetation cover in different bioclimatic zones. Among all environmental variables, substrate temperature and water temperature were the best predictors of the amphibian body temperature. Overall, this study revealed amphibian body temperature patterns along an elevation gradient in eastern Nepal Himalaya, which were principally driven by temperature-related environmental factors. We believe our results can provide important information on amphibian physiological traits, which may help ecologists predict their responses to future climate change and formulate protection strategies.","Khatiwada, Janak R; Zhao, Tian; Jiang, Jianping",J Therm Biol,,400
264345,A classical SEIR model of transmission dynamics and clinical dynamics in controlling of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with reproduction number,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has disproportionately affected older adults and certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Data quantifying the disease burden, as well as describing clinical outcomes during hospitalization among these groups, are needed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe interim COVID-19 hospitalization rates and severe clinical outcomes by age group and race and ethnicity among US veterans by using a multisite surveillance network. METHODS: We implemented a multisite COVID-19 surveillance platform in 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers located in Atlanta, Bronx, Houston, Palo Alto, and Los Angeles, collectively serving more than 396,000 patients annually. From February 27 to July 17, 2020, we actively identified inpatient cases with COVID-19 by screening admitted patients and reviewing their laboratory test results. We then manually abstracted the patients' medical charts for demographics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we calculated hospitalization incidence and incidence rate ratios, as well as relative risk for invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and case fatality rate after adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. RESULTS: We identified 621 laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 70 years, with 65.7% (408/621) aged &#8805;65 years and 94% (584/621) male. Most COVID-19 diagnoses were among non-Hispanic Black (325/621, 52.3%) veterans, followed by non-Hispanic White (153/621, 24.6%) and Hispanic or Latino (112/621, 18%) veterans. Hospitalization rates were the highest among veterans who were &#8805;85 years old, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic Black (430, 317, and 298 per 100,000, respectively). Veterans aged &#8805;85 years had a 14-fold increased rate of hospitalization compared with those aged 18-29 years (95% CI: 5.7-34.6), whereas Hispanic or Latino and Black veterans had a 4.6- and 4.2-fold increased rate of hospitalization, respectively, compared with non-Hispanic White veterans (95% CI: 3.6-5.9). Overall, 11.6% (72/621) of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 26.6% (165/621) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 16.9% (105/621) died in the hospital. The adjusted relative risk for invasive mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit did not differ by age group or race and ethnicity, but veterans aged &#8805;65 years had a 4.5-fold increased risk of death while hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with those aged <65 years (95% CI: 2.4-8.6). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surveillance at the 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers across the United States demonstrated higher hospitalization rates and severe outcomes among older veterans, as well as higher hospitalization rates among Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic Black veterans than among non-Hispanic White veterans. These findings highlight the need for targeted prevention and timely treatment for veterans, with special attention to older aged, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic Black veterans.","Cardemil, Cristina V; Dahl, Rebecca; Prill, Mila M; Cates, Jordan; Brown, Sheldon; Perea, Adrienne; Marconi, Vincent; Bell, LaSara; Rodriguez-Barradas, Maria C; Rivera-Dominguez, Gilberto; Beenhouwer, David; Poteshkina, Aleksandra; Holodniy, Mark; Lucero-Obusan, Cynthia; Balachandran, Neha; Hall, Aron J; Kim, Lindsay; Langley, Gayle",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,400

It is evident that adopting innovative technologies such as blockchain can help in effective planning operations and resource deployments. Blockchain technology can play an important role in the healthcare sector, such as improved clinical trial data management by reducing delays in regulatory approvals, and streamline the communication between diverse stakeholders of the supply chain, etc. Moreover, the spread of misinformation has intensely increased during the outbreak, and existing platforms lack the ability to validate the authenticity of data, leading to public panic and irrational behavior. Thus, developing a blockchain-based tracking system is important to ensure that the information received by the public and government agencies is reliable and trustworthy. In this paper, we review various blockchain applications and opportunities in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and develop a tracking system for the COVID-19 data collected from various external sources. We propose, implement, and evaluate a blockchain-based system using Ethereum smart contracts and oracles to track reported data related to the number of new cases, deaths, and recovered cases obtained from trusted sources. We present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions between stakeholders in the network. We present security analysis and the cost incurred by the stakeholders, and we highlight the challenges and future directions of our work. Our work demonstrates that the proposed solution is economically feasible and ensures data integrity, security, transparency, data traceability among stakeholders.","Marbouh, Dounia; Abbasi, Tayaba; Maasmi, Fatema; Omar, Ilhaam A; Debe, Mazin S; Salah, Khaled; Jayaraman, Raja; Ellahham, Samer",Arab J Sci Eng,,400

At the same time, some of the nations have even imposed lockdown within their settings. However, such actions have disturbed the routine schedule of many people and at times compelled both elderly and young people into loneliness. Even the health professionals, who are fighting against the infection for improving the health of other individuals, have to deal with lots of mental stress and workload pressure leading to physical and mental exhaustion.

We report the roles of androgen in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells via targeting of the androgen receptor (AR) on intestinal stromal cells by negatively regulating BMP signaling. Orchidectomy (ORX) or the AR antagonist promotes expansion of intestinal epithelium but suppresses intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. Conversely, the AR agonist inhibits ISC differentiation but augments proliferation in ovariectomized mice. Mechanistically, activation of the AR increases expression of BMP antagonists but lowers expression of BMP4 and Wnt antagonists in primary stromal cells, which promotes intestinal organoid growth. Interestingly, the BMP pathway inhibitor LDN-193189 reverses the ORX-induced effects. Our results highlight that stromal cells constitute the intestinal stem cell niche and provide a possible explanation for higher incidence rates of colorectal cancer in men.","Yu, Xin; Li, Shiguang; Xu, Yiming; Zhang, Yundi; Ma, Wenlong; Liang, Changchun; Lu, Haodong; Ji, Yuge; Liu, Chuanyong; Chen, Dawei; Li, Jingxin",Stem Cell Reports,,400

However, epidemiological data on outbreak-associated depressive morbidity of female adolescents are not available. This study determines the incidence and correlates of depression among female adolescents aged 11-18 years during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China. METHODS: A large cross-sectional sample, nationwide online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the correlative factors of depression were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, 4805 female adolescents were enrolled with a median (range) age of 15 (11-18) years. Of them, 1899 (39.5%) suffered from depression with a CES-D score of > 15. The onset of depression was significantly related to age, grade, distant learning, attitude toward COVID-19, sleep duration, and physical exercise duration. Furthermore, participants aged 15-18 years (OR = 1.755, 95% CI: 1.550-1.987, p < 0.001), participating in distant learning (OR = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.564-0.894, p = 0.004), concerned about COVID-19 (OR = 0.414, 95% CI: 0.212-0.811, p = 0.010), with sleep duration/day of < 6 h (OR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.946-3.483, p < 0.001),and with physical exercise duration/day < 30 min (OR = 1.641, 95% CI: 1.455-1.850, p < 0.001) represented to be independent factors for suffering from depression.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination. More than half (54.1%) indicated at least some hesitancy toward vaccination against COVID-19, with 32.1% citing lack of evidence of vaccine effectiveness as the leading reason. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was more likely among those with more moderate (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.749-3.607) or conservative (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.048-4.421) political leanings, Black Americans (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.182-2.742), and residents of nonmetropolitan areas (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.386-2.865). CONCLUSION: Subgroups of the population may prove more challenging to vaccinate against COVID-19, requiring targeted approaches to addressing hesitancy to ensure more-vulnerable populations are adequately covered.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Fiscus, Michelle; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Chisholm-Burns, Marie",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,400

In this way, we aim to determine the effect of the belief of previously having had and not having had COVID-19 on health anxiety and CYB levels of the university students. METHODS: Our study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The target population of our study consisted of 950 students who were continuing their education in the Vocational School of Health Services, an associate degree program of a university, and the samples consisted of 794 students (85.5%) who filled out our questionnaire (n = 794). The questionnaire form included the information regarding sociodemographic characteristics and the symptoms of COVID-19, and the obtained data were electronically collected altogether with Cyberchondria Scale (CS) and Health Anxiety Inventory. FINDINGS: Health anxiety mean scores were significantly higher in people who lived alone, had a chronic disease, searched for symptoms online, and took herbal supplements against COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The mean total scores of Health Anxiety Inventory, CS, Anxiety-Increasing Factors Subscale of the students who believe they have had COVID-19 were significantly lower compared to the scores of those who believe they have not had COVID-19. Nevertheless, women and people living alone and in cities had significantly high CS scores (p < 0.05).

273399,Psychiatry in Times of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Imperative for Psychiatrists to Act Now,2020,"Double stranded RNA is generated during viral replication. The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1-6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF-&#945; responses than poly I:C of < 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFNß nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFNß binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1ß and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice.

Pediatric patients often rely on parental guidance and decision making, and this may result in a lack of immunization for some children. The availability of the COVID 19 vaccine has been widely anticipated, yet not all individuals will seek the vaccine. Once vaccines are available for children under the age of 16 years, this long-standing pediatric management issue may again emerge and impact public health. The clinical trial efficacy and safety data for children and adolescents less than 16 years of age are not yet available. A traditional approach is to discuss the concerns of the parent in relationship to presentation and review of American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) and CDC guidelines in the framework of medical and scientific explanations. This includes the presentation of efficacy and safety data. Therefore, the use of lab-based antibody testing adds scientific evidence and emphasizes the need for vaccination against SARS CoV-2 and other pathogens. The purpose of this commentary is to propose lab-based testing as a potential adjunctive strategy in addressing this public health concern. Further study of a pediatric population is required to assess the impact of the selective use of lab-based testing in improving vaccination rates among a pediatric population.","Dosanjh, A.",Journal of asthma and allergy,,400

These differences start in the retina and continue all the way to the visual cortex. Despite these differences in processing, the perceptual experience of humans is remarkably stable and continuous across the visual field. Research in the last decade has shown that processing in peripheral and foveal vision is not independent, but is more directly connected than previously thought. We address three core questions on how peripheral and foveal vision interact, and review recent findings on potentially related phenomena that could provide answers to these questions. First, how is the processing of peripheral and foveal signals related during fixation? Peripheral signals seem to be processed in foveal retinotopic areas to facilitate peripheral object recognition, and foveal information seems to be extrapolated toward the periphery to generate a homogeneous representation of the environment. Second, how are peripheral and foveal signals re-calibrated? Transsaccadic changes in object features lead to a reduction in the discrepancy between peripheral and foveal appearance. Third, how is peripheral and foveal information stitched together across saccades? Peripheral and foveal signals are integrated across saccadic eye movements to average percepts and to reduce uncertainty. Together, these findings illustrate that peripheral and foveal processing are closely connected, mastering the compromise between a large peripheral visual field and high resolution at the fovea.","Stewart, Emma E M; Valsecchi, Matteo; Schütz, Alexander C",J Vis,,400

METHODS: The authors analyzed referrals to the crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) team and inpatient admissions to acute adult wards, at Leicestershire Partnership National Health Service Trust, an integrated community and mental health trust in the United Kingdom. Number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions during a 4-week period starting March 16, 2020 (""COVID-19 period""), was studied and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019 (""control periods""). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were compared with those admitted during the 2019 control period. RESULTS: The number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions were lower during the COVID-19 period, compared with the control periods, by approximately 12% and 20%, respectively. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were significantly more often detained under the Mental Health Act and were considered to pose a risk of aggression. The pattern of diagnoses differed significantly between 2020 and 2019. A higher percentage of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were diagnosed as having nonaffective psychotic disorders (52% versus 35%) or bipolar disorder (25% versus 15%), and fewer received a diagnosis of depression (8% versus 16%), anxiety disorder (0% versus 3%), adjustment disorder (0% versus 8%), emotionally unstable personality disorder (6% versus 15%), or any other personality disorder (0% versus 5%) (p=0.01).

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures.

296979,Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Cytokine Storms for More Effective Treatments from an Inflammatory Pathophysiology,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with reports of increased substance use. College students are a population of concern for high risk binge drinking and their behavior may be particularly impacted by COVID-19 campus closures. Therefore, we examine first-year college students' binge drinking soon after their university's pandemic-related suspension of in-person operations. METHODS: Students from a single campus (N = 741; age: M = 18.05, SD = 0.22) completed one assessment in April-May 2020 post-campus closure (March 2020) including theoretically-informed measures (e.g., drinking motives, norms) and two items of self-reported pre- and post-closure binge drinking frequency, the focus of these analyses. RESULTS: About half of students consistently reported not binge drinking pre- and post-closure; 6.75% reported a consistent frequency of binge drinking pre- and post-closure. Many (39.41%) reported lower 30-day binge drinking post-campus closure compared to their pre-closure reports; few (4.18%) reported higher 30-day binge drinking frequency post-campus closure. Students reporting lower binge drinking post-closure showed differences in coping, social, and enhancement drinking motives and isolation. Students reporting greater post-closure binge drinking reported higher perceived drinking norms and were more likely to be in Greek life. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates self-reported patterns in binge drinking among first-year college students at the point of COVID-19 campus closures. Pandemic-related college closures may have been a temporary environmental intervention on this high-risk behavior for some students. Although many students were not binge drinking, some continued binge drinking after closure and may benefit from preventive interventions.","Bonar, Erin E; Parks, Michael J; Gunlicks-Stoessel, Meredith; Lyden, Grace R; Mehus, Christopher J; Morrell, Nicole; Patrick, Megan E",Addict Behav,,400
297990,Development of acute kidney injury with massive granular casts and microscopic hematuria in patients with COVID-19: two case presentations with literature review,2020,"Data sources It is not made clear in this review the different databases selected or how they conducted their search. The studies used are from 1975-2020Study selection The authors have performed a scoping review using 84 studies ranging from 1975-2020. The majority of these are from before the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak period. This is indicative of the lack of evidence on this topic and exemplifies why a scoping review was carried out rather than a systematic review. The studies that were reviewed were predominately cohort and case studies. With regards to previous treatment outcomes, a few systematic reviews were included, but again, the novel nature of this outbreak means that largely, there are only cohort or case studies available for review.Data extraction and synthesis There are ten authors, with no indication of how many performed the literature review or if a mediator was involved in the final decision making on what papers would be reviewed.Results Excessive consumption of alcohol, history of tobacco use, an ageing population, and comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary issues are substantial risk factors for episodes of unfavourable respiratory outcomes. The risk of these outcomes is increased by some of the toxic effects of treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak has a potentially disproportionate impact on the cohort of head and neck cancer patients, and the respiratory effects this has on these patients may increase morbidity and mortality. It is important to include alcohol and smoking cessation, along with good oral hygiene instruction in the care of these patients.","Dolan, Sean",Evid Based Dent,,400

301356,The Risk of Spread of Infection During Craniotomy/Craniostomy on Patients with Active Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection: Myth or Fact?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To summarise the available information on efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory agents in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: As part of a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) taskforce, a systematic literature search was conducted from January 2019 to 11 December 2020. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome framework and extracted data on efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory agents used therapeutically in SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage. The risk of bias was assessed with validated tools. RESULTS: Of the 60 372 records, 401 articles were eligible for inclusion. Studies were at variable risk of bias. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available for the following drugs: hydroxychloroquine (n=12), glucocorticoids (n=6), tocilizumab (n=4), convalescent plasma (n=4), interferon beta (n=2), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (n=2) and n=1 each for anakinra, baricitinib, colchicine, leflunomide, ruxolitinib, interferon kappa and vilobelimab. Glucocorticoids were able to reduce mortality in specific subsets of patients, while conflicting data were available about tocilizumab. Hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial at any disease stage, one RCT with anakinra was negative, one RCT with baricitinib+remdesivir was positive, and individual trials on some other compounds provided interesting, although preliminary, results. CONCLUSION: Although there is emerging evidence about immunomodulatory therapies for the management of COVID-19, conclusive data are scarce with some conflicting data. Since glucocorticoids seem to improve survival in some subsets of patients, RCTs comparing glucocorticoids alone versus glucocorticoids plus anticytokine/immunomodulatory treatment are warranted. This systematic literature review informed the initiative to formulate EULAR 'points to consider' on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory treatment from the rheumatology perspective.","Alunno, Alessia; Najm, Aurélie; Mariette, Xavier; De Marco, Gabriele; Emmel, Jenny; Mason, Laura; McGonagle, Dennis G; Machado, Pedro M",Ann. rheum. dis,,400
302248,Coronavirus Clots Coronaries: St Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a Young Male with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Vaccinations are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communities-as advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Québec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Québec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly. We believe this work will contribute to the continual growth and advancement of the pharmacy profession in Canada.","Srirangan, Kajan; Lavenue, Arnaud",,,400

The study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 on people with substance use disorders. METHODS: an observational study was carried out including patients aged &#8805; years with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to an urban hospital during March 12 to June 21,2020. RESULTS: Among 2078 patients admitted, 27 (1.3%) were people with substance use disorders: 23(85.2%) were men with a median age of 56.1 + 10.3 years and. The main SUD were alcohol in 18(66.7%) patients, heroine in 6(22.2%) and cocaine in 3(11.1%) and 24(88.8%) patients were on ongoing substance use disorder treatment. One or more comorbidities associated to COVID-19 risk were observed in 18(66.6%) of patients. During a median length of stay of 10 days (IQR:7-19), severe pneumonia developed in 7(25.9%) patients, acute respiratory distress syndrome in 5 (18.5%) and none died. CONCLUSION: Larger sample sizes and sero-epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the low incidence of severe COVID-19 on patients with SUD.","Vallecillo, G; Perelló, R; Güerri, R; Fonseca, F; Torrens, M",J. public health (Oxf),,400
304988,POS-533 Association of end-stage renal disease with mortality in COVID-19 positive patients- A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Immunological adaptations in pregnancy allow maternal tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus but also increase maternal susceptibility to infection. At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells-principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells-which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.","Cornish, Emily F; Filipovic, Iva; Åsenius, Fredrika; Williams, David J; McDonnell, Thomas",Front Immunol,,400

306726,The Exclusion of Older Persons From Vaccine and Treatment Trials for Coronavirus Disease 2019-Missing the Target,2020,"Introduction: While pathogenesis in COVID-19 is not fully known and the effects between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system are complicated, it is known that lymphopenia, hyper-inflammatory responses, and cytokines play an important role in the pathology of COVID-19. While some hematological abnormalities have been described among the laboratory features of COVID-19, there have not been studies reported on lymphocyte subset analyses in children. The aim of this study was to describe lymphocyte subsets in pediatric patients with mild/moderate or severe COVID-19. Methods: The subjects in the study were children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia confirmed with the real-time RT-PCR. The subjects were admitted to the Children's Medical Center, affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, between March 7(th) and June 10(th) of 2020. The complete blood counts and lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed for each patient. Results: The study included 55 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 patients (62%) with an observed mild/moderate case of the disease and 21 patients (38%) with severedisease). Lymphocyte counts were found to be lower in patients with a severe case (mean ± SD 1.6 ± 0.9 in the severe group vs. 2.3 ± 2.2 in the mild group). Compared to the group with mild/moderate pneumonia, children with severe pneumonia had an increased count of CD8(+) T cell and a lower percentage of CD4(+) T cell. However, the differences between the groups were negligible. Interestingly, the severe group had a lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio compared to the mild group (1.1 ± 0.47 vs. 1.4 ± 0.8, p-value: 0.063). CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio &lt;2, 1.5, and 1 was found in 48 (87%), 40 (73%), and 19 cases (35%). All of the seven cases in which the subject passed (13%) had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of &lt;2, 86% had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of &lt;1.5, and 29% had CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio of &lt;1. Conclusion: The CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with mild/moderate form of disease. However, although a decline in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio may serve as a useful metric in analyzing of the derangement in immune responses in patients with severe COVID-19, further study with larger sample sizes is highly recommended.","Mahmoudi, S.; Yaghmaei, B.; Sharifzadeh Ekbatani, M.; Pourakbari, B.; Navaeian, A.; Parvaneh, N.; Haghi Ashtiani, M.

I recall a few situations where statistics made a real difference and reinforced the impact of our discipline on society. Sometimes the difference lay in the insightful analysis and inference enabled by ground-breaking methods in our field like hypothesis testing, likelihood ratios, Bayesian models, jackknife, and bootstrap. But perhaps more often, the impacts came from thoughtful analyses before data were collected, and the questions that arose after the statistical analysis. The impact of understanding the problem, designing the experiment and data collections, conducting the pilot surveys, and raising important questions, is substantial. Through sensible explorations following formal statistical procedures, statisticians have made contributions in many domains. In this presentation, I recall some examples which made a long-lasting impact. Some of them, like randomization in clinical trials, known and familiar to all, are so ingrained in our practice that the role of statistics has been forgotten. Others may be less familiar but nonetheless benefited greatly from the critical input of statisticians. All remind us that our field remains today not only relevant but critical to science and society.","Kafadar, Karen",J. Am. Stat. Assoc.,,400

The wearing of face masks, widely adopted to prevent pathogen transmission, represents a novel element in many parts of the world where wearing a face mask was rare before the COVID-19 outbreak. During September 2020-March 2021, we conducted large-scale multi-species field experiments to evaluate whether face mask-use in public places elicits a behavioural response in birds by comparing their escape and alert responses when approached by a researcher with or without a face mask in four European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Poland) and Israel. We also tested whether these patterns differed between urban and rural sites. We employed Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (with phylogeny and site as random factors) controlling for a suite of covariates and found no association between the face mask-wear and flight initiation distance, alert distance, and fly-away distance, respectively, neither in urban nor in rural birds. However, we found that all three distances were strongly and consistently associated with habitat type and starting distance, with birds showing earlier escape and alert behaviour and longer distances fled when approached in rural than in urban habitats and from longer initial distances. Our results indicate that wearing face masks did not trigger observable changes in antipredator behaviour across the Western Palearctic birds, and our data did not support the role of habituation in explaining this pattern.","Mikula, Peter; Jokimäki, Jukka; Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki, Marja-Liisa; Markó, Gábor; Morelli, Federico; Møller, Anders Pape; Szakony, Sára; Yosef, Reuven; Albrecht, Tomás; Tryjanowski, Piotr",Sci Total Environ,,400
308655,P.140 Emergency caesarean section for a parturient in acute respiratory distress due to COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, health experts, and ethicists have proposed guidelines about ICU triage and priority access to a vaccine. To increase political legitimacy and accountability, public support is important. This study examines what criteria beyond medical need are deemed important to be perceived of priority COVID-19 healthcare access. METHOD: Two conjoint experiments about priority over ICU treatment and early COVID-19 vaccination were implemented in a probability-based sample of 1461 respondents representative of the Netherlands. Respondents were asked who should receive treatment out of two fictitious healthcare claimants that differed in in age, weight, complying with corona policy measures, and occupation, all randomly assigned. Average marginal coefficient effects are estimated to assess the relative importance of the attributes; attributes were interacted with relevant respondent characteristics to find whether consensus exists in this relative ranking. RESULTS: The Dutch penalize those not complying with coronavirus policy measures, and the obese, but prioritize those employed in 'crucial' sectors. For these conditions, there is consensus among the population. For age, young people are prioritized for ICU treatment, while the middle-aged are given priority over a vaccine, with younger respondents favoring healthcare for elderly claimants, while older respondents favor support for young cohorts. CONCLUSION: People who have no control over their social risk and are able to reciprocate to society are considered as more deserving of priority of COVID-19 healthcare. Our findings provide fair support for the implemented ethical guidelines about ICU-treatment and COVID-19 vaccines.","Reeskens, Tim; Roosma, Femke; Wanders, Evelien",BMC Public Health,,400

METHODS: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection prevention and control precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95% CI 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (incident rate ratio 1.019; 95% confidence interval 1.017-1.021, P < 0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95% confidence interval 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of infection prevention and control requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.","O039,; Reilly, Gerard M; Mitchell, Rob D; Wu, Jamin; Rajiv, Prithi; Bannon-Murphy, Holly; Amos, Timothy; Brichko, Lisa; Brennecke, Helen; Noonan, Michael P; Mitra, Biswadev; Paton, Andrew; Hiller, Ryan; Smit, De Villiers; Luckhoff, Carl; Santamaria, Mark J; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg Med Australas,,400

Therefore, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common. Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with an adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma.

312701,A novel deep learning-based quantification of serial chest computed tomography in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"For testing the effectiveness of air purification devices in regard to the reduction of virus-containing aerosols, a test method involving test viruses has been lacking until now. The use of bacteriophages (phiX174 phages) is a method to test the efficiency of air purification devices under experimental conditions. Using air purifiers with a HEPA filter H14, a 4.6-6.1 Log reduction of test viruses can be achieved if bacteriophages are directly aerosolised into the air purifier, which corresponds to a reduction of 99.9974-99.9999%. Due to the complexity and individuality of air flow, an experimental approach was used in which all outside influences were minimised. The experimental setup was practical and chosen to project a scenario of direct transmission by an emitting source to a recipient. The experiments were performed with and without the air purifier at a distance of 0.75 m and 1.5 m each. Using the air purifier at a setting of 1000 m3/h, the concentration of the phiX174 phages in the air could be reduced by 2.86 Log (mean value). Nevertheless, the experiments without the air purifier showed a similar reduction rate of 2.61 Log (mean value) after 35 min. The concentration of phiX174 phages in the air could be additionally reduced up to 1 log step (maximum value) by the use of the air purifier in comparison to the experiments without. Distance was shown to be an important factor for risk reduction.","Zacharias, Nicole; Haag, Alexandra; Brang-Lamprecht, Regina; Gebel, Jürgen; Essert, Sarah M; Kistemann, Thomas; Exner, Martin; Mutters, Nico T; Engelhart, Steffen",Sci Total Environ,,400

AIM: To examine women's pregnancy experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a qualitative design with 14 pregnant women who were admitted to a state hospital pregnancy outpatient clinic for antenatal control. The data were collected using a semi-structured individual interview form and analyzed with the thematic analysis technique. COREQ checklist guide was followed in the study. RESULTS: The pregnancy experiences of women in the COVID-19 pandemic were examined under 7 main themes: ""physical health, psychosocial health, adaptation to pregnancy, pregnancy follow-up, social life, spouse relationship, and coping methods"". Pregnant women have both positive and negative pregnancy experiences in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the pandemic has affected both the physical and psychosocial health of pregnant women, their social life, marital relationship, and access to antenatal care services. Health professionals need to evaluate psychosocial health as well as the physical health of pregnant women, especially during the pandemic, and create a care plan accordingly. Midwives and other health professionals should improve the bio-psychosocial health of the pregnant/family via telehealth and counseling services.","Aydin, Ruveyde; Aktas, Songül",Int J Clin Pract,,400

METHODS ：According to the recommendations of related medical staff protection guideline，combined with the characteristics and prevention and control requirements of novel coronavirus pneumonia （COVID- 19），based on the basic principle of exposure protection ，actual exposure risk of infections for hospital pharmaceutical staff were evaluated，and the countermeasures for exposure protection were constructed under the epidemic condition of COVID- 19. RESULTS：According to the standard prevention principle and the risk evaluation of infection exposure ，most of the pharmaceutical posts in the hospital belonged to low-risk exposure posts ，and only a few posts belonged to medium-and high-risk exposure posts. Personal protective equipment should be provided according to the exposure risk level of different pharmaceutical posts and work demand. At the same time ，infection protection training should be strengthened ；environment and facilities in pharmacy should be cleaned and disinfected. CONCLUSIONS ：Standard prevention principle should be followed by hospital pharmaceutical staff during epidemic period. Based on the characteristics and exposure risks of pharmacy posts ，and according to the regulations of the hospital，personal protection for hospital pharmaceutical staff should be conducted according to the exposure risk level determined by the pharmaceutical department and relevant management regulations to avoid over-protection or inadequate protection ，so as to ensure the smooth and safe development of pharmaceutical care.,"YAN, Yingying; YUAN, Xiaoning; YANG, Yiheng; YANG, Li; LIU, Fang; ZHAI, Suodi; ZHAO, Rongsheng",China Pharmacy,,400

In this article we assess the evolution of policy thinking on how to make climate transitions happen; the potential of the European Green Deal; and how progressives need to shape it and any UK counterpart to meet the challenges of modern society. The European initiative arises from a broad coalition spanning the political spectrum. Yet, its central thrust of active government offers the prospect of reviving a battered social democracy. We indicate the openings here for a pluralist, ecological left.

Due to the pathophysiological characteristics of the COVID-19 syndrome, the particular transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the high globalization of our era, the epidemic emergency from China has spread rapidly all over the world. Human-to-human transmission seems to occur mainly through close contact with symptomatic people affected by COVID-19, and the main way of contagion is via the inhalation of respiratory droplets, for example when patients talk, sneeze or cough. The ability of the virus to survive outside living organisms, in aerosol or on fomites has also been recognized. The dental practitioners are particularly exposed to a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because they cannot always respect the interpersonal distance of more than a meter and are exposed to saliva, blood, and other body fluids during surgical procedures. Moreover, many dental surgeries can generate aerosol, and the risk of airborne infection is to be considered higher. The aim of this paper is to provide practical advice for dentists based on the recent literature, which may be useful in reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 during clinical practice.","Amato, Alessandra; Caggiano, Mario; Amato, Massimo; Moccia, Giuseppina; Capunzo, Mario; De Caro, Francesco",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,400

Asymptomatic carriers are of great concern as they can undermine the interventions to stop the pandemic. However, there is limited information about the characteristics and outcomes of the asymptomatic patients. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study and retrieved data of 79 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at admission from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The asymptomatic patients could happen at any age, ranged from 9 to 96 years. These patients also had lower levels of alanine aminotransferase and C-reactive protein. Patchy shadowing was the most common manifestation in computed tomography scan. Some asymptomatic carriers developed mild or moderate symptoms during hospitalization. Age and comorbidities, especially hypertension, may be predictive factors for symptom development in the initially asymptomatic carriers at admission. Early detection and treatment for these presymptomatic patients before symptom onset can shorten the communicable period for the coronavirus and reduce the occurrence of severe cases.","Yu, Chao; Zhou, Miao; Liu, Yang; Guo, Tinglin; Ou, Chongyang; Yang, Liye; Li, Yan; Li, Dongliang; Hu, Xinyu; Shuai, Li; Wang, Bin; Zou, Zui",Virulence,,400

This qualitative study aimed to examine the lived, psychosocial experiences of individuals with anorexia nervosa from within COVID-19 'lockdown' confinement. METHODS: Audio-recorded semi -structured interviews were conducted online during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic during confinement with a purposive sample of 12 participants who identified as having Anorexia Nervosa. Interviews were transcribed and anonymous data analysed using Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). RESULTS: Three key themes with six contributory subthemes were identified. Key themes were: loss of control,supportduring confinement, and time of reflection on recovery. Theme content varied according to stage of recovery and current clinical management. Availability of 'safe' foods, increases in compensatory exercise and symptomology, and enhanced opportunities for ""secrecy"" were described. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a unique insight for a vulnerable group from within COVID-19 confinement. The data demonstrated that the impact for individuals with anorexia nervosa has been broadly negative, and participants voiced concerns over the long-term effects of the pandemic on their recovery. The findings highlight the risks of tele-health support and an important role for health professionals in enhancing targeted support during, and after confinement.","Hunter, Rachael; Gibson, Chloe",Appetite,,400
329450,Impact of High-Dose Prophylactic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a worldwide pandemic with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, overwhelming healthcare systems globally. Preliminary reports suggest a high incidence of infection and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing KRT in Scotland. METHODS: Study design was an observational cohort study. Data were linked between the Scottish Renal Registry, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group national data sets using a unique patient identifier (Community Health Index (CHI)) for each individual by the Public Health and Intelligence unit of Public Health, Scotland. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: During the period 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020, 110 patients receiving KRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 amounting to 2% of the prevalent KRT population. Of those affected, 86 were receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. Patients who tested positive were older and more likely to reside in more deprived postcodes. Mortality was high at 26.7% in the dialysis patients and 29.2% in the transplant patients. CONCLUSION: The rate of detected SARS-CoV-2 in people receiving KRT in Scotland was relatively low but with a high mortality for those demonstrating infection. Although impossible to confirm, it appears that the measures taken within dialysis units coupled with the national shielding policy, have been effective in protecting this population from infection.","Bell, Samira; Campbell, Jacqueline; McDonald, Jackie; O039,; Neill, Martin; Watters, Chrissie; Buck, Katharine; Cousland, Zoe; Findlay, Mark; Lone, Nazir I; Metcalfe, Wendy; Methven, Shona; Peel, Robert; Almond, Alison; Sanu, Vinod; Spalding, Elaine; Thomson, Peter C; Mark, Patrick B; Traynor, Jamie P",BMC Nephrol,,400

Rapid research and development, on an international scale, has already generated assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host immunoglobulins. However, the complexities of COVID-19 are such that fuller definitions of patient status, trajectory, sequelae, and responses to therapy are now required. There is accumulating evidence-from studies of both COVID-19 and the related disease SARS-that protein biomarkers could help to provide this definition. Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., C-reactive protein) have already been identified as possible predictors of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Proteomics technologies, with their ability to detect many proteins per analysis, have begun to extend these early findings. To be effective, proteomics strategies must include not only methods for comprehensive data acquisition (e.g., using mass spectrometry) but also informatics approaches via which to derive actionable information from large data sets. Here we review applications of proteomics to COVID-19 and SARS and outline how pipelines involving technologies such as artificial intelligence could be of value for research on these diseases.","Whetton, Anthony D; Preston, George W; Abubeker, Semira; Geifman, Nophar",J Proteome Res,,400

STUDY DESIGN: Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence/incidence of a symptoms-based mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in southern Tuscany, by using an online survey. METHODS: An anonymous random middle-aged sample of 3,460 individuals completed the survey. A symptom-score &#8805;5, calculated on 195 patients with RT-PCR COVID-19 disease (sensitivity/specificity of 0.815/0.780 respectively) was used for the diagnosis. RESULT: This cut-off highlighted that 12.3% of all the population might have had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 3.9% of them might have it at the time of the survey. Female sex (OR=1.334 [1.029-1.728]; p=0.030), obesity status (OR=1.961 [1.304-2.949]; p=0.001), asthma (OR=2.035 [1.433-2.890]; p=0.0001), autoimmune diseases (OR=2.103 [1.381-3.201]; p=0.001), were all risk factors for showing mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Instead, the elderly had a low probability to develop mild forms of the disease (OR=0.984 [0.975-0.994]; p=0.001). Symptoms scores might be used to screen subjects with a suspected infection. Female sex, obesity, asthma, autoimmune diseases may be factors linked with mild forms of COVID-19 disease.","Scalese, M; Trivellini, G; Sposato, B",Ann. ig,,400

Although severe COVID-19 illness and significant mortality occur across the lifespan, the fatality rate increases with age, especially for people over 65 years of age. The dichotomization of COVID-19 patients by age has been proposed as a way to decide who will receive intensive care admission when critical care unit beds or ventilators are limited. We provide perspectives and evidence why alternative approaches should be used. Methods Practitioners and researchers in geriatric medicine and gerontology have led in the development of alternative approaches to using chronological age as the sole criterion for allocating medical resources. Evidence and ethical based recommendations are provided. Results Age alone should not drive decisions for health-care resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Decisions on health-care resource allocation should take into consideration the preferences of the patient and their goals of care, as well as patient factors like the Clinical Frailty Scale score based on their status two weeks before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions Age alone does not accurately capture the variability of functional capacities and physiological reserve seen in older adults. A threshold of 5 or greater on the Clinical Frailty Scale is recommended if this scale is utilized in helping to decide on access to limited health-care resources such as admission to a critical care unit and/or intubation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Montero-Odasso, Manuel; Hogan, David B.; Lam, Robert; Madden, Kenneth; MacKnight, Christopher; Molnar, Frank; Rockwood, Kenneth; Stall, Nathan; Theou, Olga; Wong, Camilla",Canadian Geriatrics J.,,400

This virus is a new isolate of coronavirus, and the current infection crisis has surpassed the SARS and MERS epidemics that occurred in 2002 and 2013, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 people, causing 5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly demonstrates the potential threat of respiratory viruses to human health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied. What is intriguing, however, is the higher susceptibility of the elderly, especially individuals who are older than 60 years of age, and have comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in users of chronic angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating coronaviruses. We believe that these points are pivotal for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.","Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Nakaya, Helder",Clinics,,400

This survey of first-time synchronous teledermatology patients (n = 100) seen by providers of the University of Mississippi Medical Center during Spring 2020 was designed to learn more about patient experiences associated with the technical challenges of synchronous teledermatology. Our patient population had considerable experience with various social media including Facebook (82%) and hardware platforms, such as Apple devices (66%). We found that the majority of patients were satisfied (88.9%) with their synchronous teledermatology encounter and 81.8% of patients did not experience a technical difficulty with their consult. About 15% of patients lost connection with their provider during their consultation. Furthermore, about 30% of patients rated ""showing their skin"" to their provider as ""hardest"" on a ten scale.

In present research, the impacts of bacteria (both Gram (-) E. coli and Gram (+) B. subtilis) on the transport/deposition of model microplastics (MPs) in porous media were examined in NaCl salt solutions (5 and 25 mM, pH = 6). Both negative carboxylate-modified MPs (CMPs) and positive amine-modified MPs (AMPs) were concerned. We found that under both solution conditions, the presence of both types of bacteria decreased CMPs transport and enhanced retention of CMPs in sand columns. In contrast, the presence of bacteria (regardless of cell type) yet increased AMPs transport and decreased their deposition in sand columns under both ionic strength conditions. The mechanisms leading to the altered transport of CMPs and AMPs by bacteria were different. The formation of larger sized CMPs-bacteria clusters and the extra deposition sites resulted from bacteria adsorbed on quartz sand contributed to the decreased CMPs transport and enhanced their deposition in sand columns. Whereas, the formation of AMPs-bacteria clusters with overall negatively surface charge improved AMPs transport in quartz sand.","He, Lei; Rong, Haifeng; Li, Meng; Zhang, Mengya; Liu, Sirui; Yang, Meng; Tong, Meiping",J Hazard Mater,,400

The proofreading activity of the ExoN domain has played a key role in the growth of nidoviral genomes, while in arenaviruses this domain partakes in the suppression of the host innate immune signaling. Sequence and structural homology analyses suggest that these proteins have been hijacked from cellular hosts many times. Analysis of the available nidoviral ExoN sequences reveals a high conservation level comparable to that of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which are the most conserved viral proteins. Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified. This is in sharp contrast with the reported lack of zinc fingers in cellular ExoNs, and opens the possibility of therapeutic strategies in the struggle against COVID-19.","Cruz-González, Adrián; Muñoz-Velasco, Israel; Cottom-Salas, Wolfgang; Becerra, Arturo; Campillo-Balderas, José A; Hernández-Morales, Ricardo; Vázquez-Salazar, Alberto; Jácome, Rodrigo; Lazcano, Antonio",PLoS One,,400

Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity. However, the phenotypic characteristics of diabetes in COVID-19 patients are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint. ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation. RESULTS: The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8 ± 13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m2; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%). Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively. The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7. In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]). On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome. Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered. METHODS: From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7%. 35.2% of only children and 38.8% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5% of only children and 24.7% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (ORâ¯=â¯1.164, 95%CI: 1.064-1.273, pâ¯=â¯0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (ORâ¯=â¯2.284, 95%CI: 1.640-3.180, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (ORâ¯=â¯1.959, 95%CI: 1.402-2.737, p < 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The non-only children are more likely to develop the symptoms of anxiety and depression than only children, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The adolescents with siblings are psychiatrically more vulnerable to exposure risk of COVID-19 and need more attention, especially those with poor parent-child relationship, low resilience and experience of emotional abuse.","Cao, Yujia; Huang, Liyuan; Si, Tong; Wang, Ning Qun; Qu, Miao; Zhang, Xiang Yang",J Affect Disord,,400

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on standard-of-care treatment (21 patients). After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn) from the ruxolitinib group, 20 patients in the intervention group and 21 patients in the control group were included in the study. Treatment with ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care was not associated with significantly accelerated clinical improvement in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019, although ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Eighteen (90%) patients from the ruxolitinib group showed computed tomography improvement at day 14 compared with 13 (61.9%) patients from the control group (P = .0495). Three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure, with 14.3% overall mortality at day 28; no patients died in the ruxolitinib group. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with low toxicities and no new safety signals. Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistical difference was observed, ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Significant chest computed tomography improvement, a faster recovery from lymphopenia, and favorable side-effect profile in the ruxolitinib group were encouraging and informative to future trials to test efficacy of ruxolitinib in a larger population.","Cao, Yang; Wei, Jia; Zou, Liang; Jiang, Tiebin; Wang, Gaoxiang; Chen, Liting; Huang, Liang; Meng, Fankai; Huang, Lifang; Wang, Na; Zhou, Xiaoxi; Luo, Hui; Mao, Zekai; Chen, Xing; Xie, Jungang; Liu, Jing; Cheng, Hui; Zhao, Jianping; Huang, Gang; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Jianfeng",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,400

350478,PRS81 Insights into the Coronavirus Disease Perceptions in Pakistan,2020,"BACKGROUND: The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is the most widely used and reliable clinical routine method for the detection of important protein markers in healthcare. Improving ELISAs is crucial for detecting biomolecules relates to health disorders and facilitating diagnosis at the early diseases stages. Several methods have been developed to improve the ELISA sensitivity through immobilization of antibodies on the microtiter plates. We have developed a highly sensitive ELISA strategy based on the preparation of acetylated chitosan surfaces in order to improve the antibodies orientation. RESULTS: Chitin surfaces were obtained by mixing small quantities of chitosan and acetic anhydride in each well of a microtiter plate. Anti-c-myc 9E10 low affinity antibody fused to ChBD was cloned and expressed in CHO cells obtaining the anti-c-myc-ChBD antibody. We found that anti c-myc-ChBD binds specifically to the chitin surfaces in comparison with anti-c-myc 9E10, which did not. Chitin surface was used to develop a sandwich ELISA to detect the chimeric human protein c-myc-GST-IL8 cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ELISA assays developed on chitin surfaces were 6-fold more sensitive than those performed on standard surface with significant differences (p<0,0001). CONCLUSIONS: As shown here, acetylated chitosan surfaces improve the antibody orientation on the substrate and constitute a suitable method to replace the standard surfaces given the stability over time and the low cost of its preparation.","García-Maceira, Tania; García-Maceira, Fé I; González-Reyes, José A; Paz-Rojas, Elier",BMC Biotechnol,,400
352700,Symptoms and Critical Illness Among Obstetric Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection,2020,"Background: The pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) is a serious on-going global public crisis. Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical spreading properties observed in empirical data. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.","Han, Xiao-Pu; Wang, Bing-Hong; Zhou, Chang-Song; Zhou, Tao; Zhu, Jun-Fang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1390v2.pdf,400

354407,Cardiovascular Consequences and Considerations of Coronavirus Infection - Perspectives for the Cardiothoracic Anesthesiologist and Intensivist During the Coronavirus Crisis,2020,"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States, using case fatalities from February 29, 2020 up to April 25, 2020, when some states began reversing their interventions. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt, for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt, and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","Olney, Andrew M; Smith, Jesse; Sen, Saunak; Thomas, Fridtjof; Unwin, H Juliette T",Am. j. epidemiol,,400

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study whether EOL discussions were offered and to what degree patients were alone at time of death when dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), comparing deaths in nursing homes and hospitals. METHODS: The national Swedish Register of Palliative Care was used. All expected deaths from COVID-19 in nursing homes and hospitals were compared with, and contrasted to, deaths in a reference population (deaths in 2019). RESULTS: A total of 1346 expected COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes (n = 908) and hospitals (n = 438) were analyzed. Those who died were of a more advanced age in nursing homes (mean 86.4 years) and of a lower age in hospitals (mean 80.7 years) (P < 0.0001). Fewer EOL discussions with patients were held compared with deaths in 2019 (74% vs. 79%, P < 0.001), and dying with someone present was much more uncommon (59% vs. 83%, P < 0.0001). In comparisons between nursing homes and hospital deaths, more patients dying in nursing homes were women (56% vs. 37%, P < 0.0001), and significantly fewer had a retained ability to express their will during the last week of life (54% vs. 89%, P < 0.0001). Relatives were present at time of death in only 13% and 24% of the cases in nursing homes and hospitals, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding figures for staff were 52% and 38% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dying from COVID-19 negatively affects the possibility of holding an EOL discussion and the chances of dying with someone present. This has considerable social and existential consequences for both patients and families.","Strang, Peter; Bergström, Jonas; Martinsson, Lisa; Lundström, Staffan",J Pain Symptom Manage,,400

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. The early CT findings are patchy GGO with or without consolidation involving multiple lobes, mainly in the peripheral zone, accompanied by halo sign, vascular thickening, crazy paving pattern, or air bronchogram sign.","Han, Rui; Huang, Lu; Jiang, Hong; Dong, Jin; Peng, Hongfen; Zhang, Dongyou",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,400

We studied whether use of NSAIDs was associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Danish administrative and health registries. We included individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period 27 February 2020 to 29 April 2020. NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-users on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs. The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy. A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI -3.5% to 3.7%, p = 0.95), risk of hospitalization (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53, p = 0.31; RD 3.3%, 95% CI -3.4% to 10%, p = 0.33), ICU admission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, p = 0.90; RD 0.2%, 95% CI -3.0% to 3.4%, p = 0.90), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.30, p = 0.72; RD 0.5%, 95% CI -2.5% to 3.6%, p = 0.73), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.09, p = 0.81; RD -0.2%, 95% CI -2.0% to 1.6%, p = 0.81). The main limitations of the study are possible exposure misclassification, as not all individuals who fill an NSAID prescription use the drug continuously, and possible residual confounding by indication, as NSAIDs may generally be prescribed to healthier individuals due to their side effects, but on the other hand may also be prescribed for early symptoms of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy in Danish individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

361482,Coronavirus Disease and the Shared Emotion of Blaming Others: Reviewing Media Opinion Polls During the Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterized by fast deterioration in the mechanism of cytokine storm. Therefore, treatment with immunomodulating agents should be initiated as soon as hyperinflammation is established. Evidence for the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 is emerging, but the drug in this setting is used ""off label"" with limited data on both effectiveness and safety. Therefore, Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw established a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the use of TCZ in severe COVID-19 cases. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of 27-year-old, otherwise healthy man, who was successfully treated with chloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab and a standard of care. Initially the magnitude of lung devastation, clinical deterioration and the need for mechanical ventilation suggested unfavorable prognosis. However, we observed complete regression in radiological changes and rapid clinical improvement. Irrespective of this, patient's serum interleukin 6 and aminotransferases remained elevated even after a month from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: An overlapping effect of hyperinflammation, hypoxic organ injury and drug-related toxicity warrants a long-term follow-up for COVID-19 survivors. In addition, residual IL-6 receptors blockage may mask new infections. A standardized approach to follow-up for COVID-19 survivors is urgently needed. Current and future research should also investigate the impact of experimental therapies on lung tissue healing and regeneration, as well as long-term treatment toxicities.","Podlasin, Regina B; Kowalska, Justyna D; Pihowicz, Andrzej; Wojtycha-Kwasnica, Beata; Thompson, Magdalena; Dyda, Tomasz; Czeszko-Paprocka, Hanna; Horban, Andrzej",Eur J Med Res,,400

363514,Ocular findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an outbreak hospital,2020,"Stringent mitigation measures have reduced wintertime fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations by 42.2% from 2013 to 2018 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, but severe PM pollution still frequently engulfs the region. The observed nitrate aerosols have not exhibited a significant decreasing trend and constituted a major fraction (about 20%) of the total PM2.5, although the surface-measured NO2 concentration has decreased by over 20%. The contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions mitigation to the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations and how to alleviate nitrate aerosols efficiently under the current situation still remains elusive. The WRF-Chem model simulations of a persistent and heavy PM pollution episode in January 2019 in the BTH reveal that NOX emissions mitigation does not help lower wintertime nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations under current conditions in the BTH. A 50% reduction in NOX emissions only decreases nitrate mass by 10.3% but increases PM2.5 concentrations by 3.2%, because the substantial O3 increase induced by NOX mitigation offsets the HNO3 loss and enhances sulfate and secondary organic aerosols formation. Our results are further consolidated by the occurrence of severe PM pollution in the BTH during the COVID-19 outbreak, with a significant reduction in NO2 concentration. Mitigation of NH3 emissions constitutes the priority measure to effectively lower the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH under current conditions, with 35.5% and 12.7% decrease, respectively, when NH3 emissions are reduced by 50%.","Li, Xia; Bei, Naifang; Hu, Bo; Wu, Jiarui; Pan, Yuepeng; Wen, Tianxue; Liu, Zirui; Liu, Lang; Wang, Ruonan; Li, Guohui",Environ Pollut,,400

364586,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Cancer Patients,2020,"Adriamycin (ADR) is an anthracycline antibiotic used for treatment of many types of cancer. However, its applications may damage to healthy tissues. Chloroquine (CLQ) is an anti-inflammatory agent used in treatment of many inflammation associated diseases such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, it is used in the treatment of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. The aim of this study is to determine possible therapeutic effects of Chloroquine on Adriamycin-induced testicular toxicity in rats. We investigated the effect of CLQ on testicular injury caused by ADR. Rats were divided into four groups: Control, ADR, CLQ, ADR+CLQ. After administrations, animals were sacrificed, and testis tissues were extracted from the animals for the further examinations. Histopathological changes in testis tissues were evaluated and TNF-a and IL-6 immunostaining were performed to determine the expression levels of these cytokines. TUNEL method were used for evaluation of apoptotic index. Moreover, serum testosterone levels were measured by ELISA assay. We observed that ADR group showed histopathological deterioration when compared to the Control group and CLQ treatment ameliorated this damage induced by Adriamycin. An increase in TNF-a and IL-6 immunoreactivities and in the number of apoptotic cells and a decrease in serum testosterone levels were determined in the ADR group compared to the Control and CLQ group. Furthermore, our examinations showed an improvement in testicular tissue in ADR+CLQ group in terms of these parameters when compared to the ADR group. We suggest that CLQ can be used as a protective agent to reduce the toxic effects of Adriamycin as a result of its antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.

367506,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Surgical Recommendations in Latin America,2020,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most encountered arrhythmia and has been associated with worse in-hospital outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study was to determine the incidence of AF in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as its impact on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test between March 1 and April 27, 2020, were identified from the common medical record system of 13 Northwell Health hospitals. Natural language processing search algorithms were used to identify and classify AF. Patients were classified as having AF or not. AF was further classified as new-onset AF vs history of AF. RESULTS: AF occurred in 1687 of 9564 patients (17.6%). Of those, 1109 patients (65.7%) had new-onset AF. Propensity score matching of 1238 pairs of patients with AF and without AF showed higher in-hospital mortality in the AF group (54.3% vs 37.2%; P < .0001). Within the AF group, propensity score matching of 500 pairs showed higher in-hospital mortality in patients with new-onset AF as compared with those with a history of AF (55.2% vs 46.8%; P = .009). The risk ratio of in-hospital mortality for new-onset AF in patients with sinus rhythm was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.42-1.71; P < .0001). The presence of cardiac disease was not associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with AF (P = .1). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 17.6% experienced AF. AF, particularly new-onset, was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.","Mountantonakis, Stavros E; Saleh, Moussa; Fishbein, Joanna; Gandomi, Amir; Lesser, Martin; Chelico, John; Gabriels, James; Qiu, Michael; Epstein, Laurence M",Heart rhythm,,400

STUDY DESIGN: MIS-C studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase as well as preprint repositories and article references to identify studies of MIS-C cases published from April 25, 2020, through June 29, 2020. MIS-C study metadata were assessed and information on case demographics, clinical symptoms, laboratory measurements, treatments, and outcomes were summarized and contrasted between studies. RESULTS: Eight studies were identified representing a total of 440 MIS-C cases. Inclusion criteria varied by study: 3 studies selected patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, 2 required cardiovascular involvement, and 3 had broader multisystem inclusion criteria. Median age of patients by study ranged from 7.3 to 10 years, and 59% of patients were male. Across all studies, the proportion of patients with positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 13% to 69% and for serology, from 75% to 100%. Patients with MIS-C had high prevalence of gastrointestinal (87%), dermatologic/mucocutaneous (73%), and cardiovascular (71%) symptoms. Prevalence of cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory system involvement significantly differed by study inclusion criteria. All studies reported elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels for at least 75% of patients in each study. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of MIS-C studies assists with understanding this newly identified syndrome and may be useful in developing a refined, universal case definition of MIS-C.","Abrams, Joseph Y; Godfred-Cato, Shana E; Oster, Matthew E; Chow, Eric J; Koumans, Emilia H; Bryant, Bobbi; Leung, Jessica W; Belay, Ermias D",J. pediatr.

369730,Impact of a large-scale telemedicine network on emergency visits and hospital admissions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Brazil: Data from the UNIMED-BH system,2020,"The large-scale COVID-19 pandemic is a severe public health emergency which poses distressing social and economic challenges to the international community as a whole. In order to provide immediate and effective support to affected welfare and healthcare systems as well as to build their lasting, inclusive and sustainable recovery, both the European Union and the United Nations have introduced a number of urgent measures aiming to help and protect citizens and economies. This paper looks into the specificities of urgent procedures launched and carried out by the two most influential international organisations with a view to rapidly respond to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. More specifically, it focuses on the involved institutions and steps of urgent procedures as well as on their most remarkable outcomes. In the case of the European Union, the emphasis is put primarily on two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiatives (CRIIs), adopted during the Croatian Presidency of the Council in one of the fastest legal procedures in the history of the European Union, and the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU) as an extension of the CRIIs' crisis repair measures. The overarching United Nations' response is assessed through an analysis of its urgent policy agenda developed on the premise that the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a health and socioeconomic emergency but also a global humanitarian, security and human rights crisis. This particularly includes procedures foreseen by the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) and the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP). In addition, the aim of the paper is to provide a critical overview of the subject by highlighting three pivotal elements. First, the paper sheds light on the financial aspects of the urgent fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, necessary for turning words into action. Notably, this refers to funds secured by the Multiannual Financial Frameworks 2014-2020 and 2021-2027, and the Next Generation EU recovery instrument, on the one hand, and the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund and the Solidarity Response Fund, on the other hand. Second, it offers a comparative evaluation of the end results of the European and global emergency procedures in mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, it summarises the underlying elements of measures governing the aftermath of the ongoing crisis, i.e. those promoting a human-centred, green, sustainable, inclusive and digital approach to future life.","Mazur-Kumrić, Nives PhD Zeko-Pivač Ivan PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,400

Scientists, medical professionals, and other stakeholders are racing against time to find and develop effective medicines for COVID-19. However, no drug with high efficacy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been approved. With the increasing popularity of gene therapy, scientists have explored the utilization of small RNAs such as microRNAs as therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3'-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies. This review systematically summarizes the potential targets of miRNA-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and examines the viability of possible transfection methods.","Rizkita, Leonny Dwi; Astuti, Indwiani",,,400

AIM: To examine pregnant women's levels of stress, mental and physical health, and health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online, with recruitment and data collection occurring between 16/6/20 and 17/7/20. Participants were pregnant women recruited via online pregnancy/parenting communities. Participants self-reported their levels of general stress, pregnancy-specific stress and COVID-19 related stress, mental and physical health, general health behaviours, and COVID-19 related health behaviours. FINDINGS: 573 pregnant women participated in the survey. Participants were most commonly resident in the United States (42.6%, n=243), Ireland (41.2%, n=235) or the United Kingdom (10%, n=57). The majority (80.0%, n=457) were married and educated to degree level or above (79.3, n=453). Pregnant women reported high levels of pregnancy-specific and COVID-19-related stress, and low levels of mental and physical health, during the pandemic. Encouragingly, pregnant women in this study generally reported high levels of adherence to public health advice and pregnancy health behaviours. Stress and general mental health outcomes were best predicted by well-being factors (including stress and social support). Health impairing behaviours (e.g. poor diet) were predicted by both well-being and demographic factors. DISCUSSION: Interventions targeting pregnancy- and pandemic-specific stress at the population level will be essential to support mental health and minimise adverse outcomes for women and children during the pandemic.","Pope, Johanna; Olander, Ellinor K; Leitao, Sara; Meaney, Sarah; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen",Women and birth (Online),,400

The prison population is more likely to suffer from physical and mental ailments both during and prior to their imprisonment due to poverty, social exclusion and chaotic lifestyles. Recognition of people in prison is noticeably absent from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite the goals' ethos of 'leaving no one behind'.We present the first analysis of how improving the health of people in prison can contribute to achieving 15 SDGs. Relevant indicators are proposed to fulfil these goals while meeting the existing international prison health standards. We also assess the political, economic and social challenges, alongside the unparalleled COVID-19 pandemic that can thwart the realisation of the SDGs. To reach the 'furthest behind first', prison health must be at the forefront of the SDGs.","Ismail, Nasrul; Lazaris, Audrey; O039,; Moore, Éamonn; Plugge, Emma; Stürup-Toft, Sunita",,,400

METHODS: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. RESULTS: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The tutorials were deployed to offer efficient and rapid global public health educational outreach as a tool to address COVID-19 healthcare training in a timely manner.","Ros, Maxime; Neuwirth, Lorenz S",Nurse Educ Today,,400

Ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are significant prognostic biomarkers used in COVID-19 patients, although they are affected by other factors such as comorbidities and age. Aging changes the immune system through immunosenescence and inflammaging; however, there are limited number of studies evaluating its effect on ferritin and NLR as part of the complete assessment for intensive care requirement and mortality risk. A single-center retrospective cohort study of 295 COVID-19 patients was performed at the Siloam Hospitals Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia from April to August 2020. After admission, all patients were followed up for clinical outcomes. Patients were grouped into strata based on age (<50 years vs. &#8805;50 years) and risk groups (low-risk ferritin vs. high-risk ferritin; low-risk NLR vs. high-risk NLR). The endpoints of the study were the intensive care requirements and mortality. Among the 295 COVID-19 patients, 264 survived and 31 deceased. Ferritin and NLR had higher area under curve (AUC) values than other inflammatory parameters and had significantly different outcomes in both mortality and intensive care requirement groups. The combination of ferritin and NLR showed higher AUC values for intensive care requirement and mortality (AUC, 0.783; 95% confidence interval, 0.703-0.864). Multivariate analysis showed that both endpoints were strongly affected by age, ferritin level, and NLR. Age significantly multiplied clinical endpoints in low-risk group patients but not in high-risk group patients. The combination of ferritin and NLR had a better predictive value for intensive care requirement and mortality risk. However, age strongly affects clinical outcome in low-risk groups of both ferritin and NLR groups; hence, it should be considered as an early predictive factor of COVID-19 disease progression.","Rasyid, Haerani; Sangkereng, Alvin; Harjianti, Tutik; Soetjipto, Audrey S",Physiol Rep,,400

386544,Laboratory medicine resilience during coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. With the rapid increase in the spread of COVID-19, many people are getting affected by it. As the disease cannot be detected until the affected person doesn't take the COVID-19 test, the person remains unaware that he has been infected by the coronavirus. The person would travel, go to shops, do other activities as well thereby infecting the other people and a potential threat to society. Thus it becomes difficult to trace all the people who have been infected. It is necessary to report all the close contacts of the infected person in the last 14 days. With the increase in the COVID-19 cases, it is very difficult to manually monitor and track down all the contacts of a COVID-19 positive patient. This calls for an autonomous application that will provide information about the person's traces, the people with whom he came in contact with and the places he visited in the last 14 days. This application will help in collecting the data for traces of a COVID-19 positive patient.","Prakash, J.; Joshi, K.; Bhavsar, M.; Sinha, S.; Sharangpani, Y.; Aote, S.",Bioscience Biotechnology Research Communications,,400

Performance of IFA was compared to a commercial ELISA IgG kit. We tested 888 RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (1302 serum samples) and 350 controls including 200 sera collected before the pandemic, 64 sera known to be associated with nonspecific serological interference, 36 sera from non-coronavirus pneumonia and 50 sera from patient with other common coronavirus to elicit false-positive serology. Incorporating an inactivated clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate as the antigen, the specificity of the assay was measured as 100% for IgA titre &#8805; 1:200, 98.6% for IgM titre &#8805; 1:200 and 96.3% for IgG titre &#8805; 1:100 after testing a series of negative controls.

The presence of antibodies was then measured at 3% before a 5-day evolution up to 47% after more than 15 days of evolution. We observed that the rates of seropositivity as well as the titre of specific antibodies were both significantly higher in patients with a poor clinical outcome than in patients with a favourable evolution. These data, which have to be integrated into the ongoing understanding of the immunological phase of the infection, suggest that detection anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is useful as a marker associated with COVID-19 severity.

Amid the well-documented threats to physical health, the effects of this public health crisis - and the varied efforts to contain its spread - have altered individuals' ""normal"" daily functioning. These impacts on social, psychological, and emotional well-being remain relatively unexplored - in particular, the ways in which Chinese men and women experience and respond to potential behavioral stressors. Our study investigated sex differences in psychological stress, emotional reactions, and behavioral responses to COVID-19 and related threats among Chinese residents. METHODS: In late February (2020), an anonymous online questionnaire was disseminated via WeChat, a popular social media platform in China. The cross-sectional study utilized a non-probabilistic ""snowball"" or convenience sampling of residents from various provinces and regions of China. Basic demographic characteristics (e.g., age and gender) - along with residential living arrangements and conditions - were measured along with psychological stress and emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Three thousand eighty-eight questionnaires were returned: 1749 females (56.6%) and 1339 males (43.4%). The mean stress level,as measured by a visual analog scale, was 3.4 (SD = 2.4) - but differed significantly by sex. Besides sex, factors positively associated with stress included: age (< 45 years), employment (unsteady income, unemployed), risk of infection (exposureto COVID-19, completed medical observation), difficulties encountered (diseases, work/study, financial, mental), and related behaviors (higher desire for COVID-19 knowledge, more time concerning on the COVID-19 outbreak). ""Protective"" factors included frequent contact with colleagues, calmness of mood comparing with the pre-pandemic, and psychological resilience. Males and females also differed significantly in adapting to current living/working, conditions, responding to run a fever, and needing psychological support services. CONCLUSIONS: The self-reported stress of Chinese residents related to the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly related to sex, age, employment, resilience and coping styles. Future responses to such public health threats may wish to provide sex- and/or age-appropriate supports for psychological health and emotional well-being to those at greatest risk of experiencing stress.","Yan, Shiyan; Xu, Rui; Stratton, Terry D; Kavcic, Voyko; Luo, Dan; Hou, Fengsu; Bi, Fengying; Jiao, Rong; Song, Kangxing; Jiang, Yang",BMC Public Health,,400

389912,Economic development and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: associations of total GDPs with total COVID-19 cases in 50 U.S. states and territories and 28 European countries,2021,"Box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a conserved class of noncoding RNA known to serve as guides for the site-specific 2-O-ribose methylation of ribosomal RNAs and the U6 small nuclear RNA, through direct base pairing with the target. In recent years however, several examples of box C/D snoRNAs regulating different levels of gene expression including transcript stability and splicing have been reported. These regulatory interactions typically require direct binding of the target but do not always involve the guide region. Supporting these new box C/D snoRNA functions, high- throughput RNA-RNA interaction datasets detect many interactions between box C/D snoRNAs and messenger RNAs. To facilitate the study of box C/D snoRNA functionality, we created snoGloBe, a box C/D snoRNA machine learning target predictor based on a gradient boosting classifier and considering snoRNA and target sequence and position as well as target type. SnoGloBe convincingly outperforms general RNA duplex predictors and PLEXY, the only box C/D snoRNA-specific target predictor available. The study of snoGloBe human transcriptome-wide predictions identifies enrichment in snoRNA interactions in exons and on exon-intron junctions. Some specific snoRNAs are predicted to target groups of functionally-related transcripts on common regulatory elements and the exact position of the predicted targets strongly overlaps binding sites of RNA-binding proteins involved in relevant molecular functions. SnoGloBe was also applied to predicting interactions between human box C/D snoRNAs and the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, identifying known and novel interactions. Overall, snoGloBe is a timely new tool that will accelerate our understanding of C/D snoRNA targets and function.","Deschamps-Francoeur, Gabrielle; Couture, Sonia; Elela, Sherif Abou; Scott, Michelle S",,,400

To complement the current model, audience barriers to prevention need to be better understood. A content analysis of news source comments in response to daily COVID-19 reports was conducted in Montana, one of the states expressing resistance to routine prevention efforts. A total of 615 Facebook comments drawn from Montana news sources were analyzed using the Persuasive Health Message Framework to identify perceived barriers and benefits of mask-wearing. A majority (63%) of comments expressed barriers, the most common of which were categorized as either misinformation about the virus or conspiracy theories. Benefits (46%) of mask-wearing were articulated as benefits to loved ones or people in one's community or saving hospital space. This paper analyzes the implications of low perceived threat accompanied by low perceived efficacy of mask-wearing to make recommendations for future prevention efforts.","Keller, Sarah N; Honea, Joy C; Ollivant, Rachel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,400

392095,Disease Severity and Perinatal Outcomes of Pregnant Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"Background: Since the Arab uprising in 2011, Libya, Syria and Yemen have gone through major internal armed conflicts. This resulted in large numbers of deaths, injuries, and population displacements, with collapse of the healthcare systems. Furthermore, the situation was complicated by the emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which made the populations of these countries struggle under unusual conditions to deal with both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. This study aimed to determine the impact of the armed conflicts on the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and highlight the strategies needed to combat the spread of the pandemic and its consequences. Methods: Official and public data concerning the dynamics of the armed conflicts and the spread of SARS-COV-2 in Libya, Syria and Yemen were collected from all available sources, starting from the emergence of COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed by a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the conflict and the prevalence of COVID-19. Results: The data indicated that there was an increase in the intensity of the violence at an early stage from March to August 2020, when it approximately doubled in the three countries, particularly in Libya. During that period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported, ranging from 5 to 53 cases/day. From September to December 2020, a significant decline in the intensity of the armed conflicts was accompanied by steep upsurges in the rate of COVID-19 cases, which reached up to 500 cases/day. The accumulative cases vary from one country to another during the armed conflict. The highest cumulative number of cases were reported in Libya, Syria and Yemen. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict provided an opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 to spread. The early weeks of the pandemic coincided with the most intense period of the armed conflicts, and few cases were officially reported. This indicates undercounting and hidden spread during the early stage of the pandemic. The pandemic then spread dramatically as the armed conflict declined, reaching its greatest spread by December 2020. Full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected. Therefore, urgent national and international strategies should be implemented to combat the pandemic and its consequences.","Daw, Mohamed A",Front Public Health,,400

Entanglement between inflammation and coagulation and resistance to heparin provide a rationale to consider other therapeutic approaches in order to preserve endothelial function and limit microthrombosis, especially in severe forms. These strategies include nebulized heparin, N-acetylcysteine, plasma exchange and/or fresh frozen plasma, plasma derivatives to increase the level of endogenous anticoagulants (tissue factor pathway inhibitor, activated protein C, thrombomodulin, antithrombin), dipyridamole, complement blockers, different types of stem cells, and extracellular vesicles.

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP with the a priori hypothesis that community exposure but not health care exposure was associated with seropositivity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted among volunteer HCP at 4 large health care systems in 3 US states. Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set. Residential weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence was calculated from state-based COVID-19 case and census data. Exposures: Model variables included demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity), community (known COVID-19 contact, COVID-19 cumulative incidence by 3-digit zip code prefix), and health care (workplace, job role, COVID-19 patient contact) factors. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site. Results: Among 24â¯749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17â¯233 [69.6%]), were women (19â¯361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15â¯157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12â¯413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10â¯000 in the community up to 1 week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20â¯072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). No assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity, including nurse job role (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), working in the emergency department (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3), or workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US HCP in 3 states, community exposures were associated with seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, but workplace factors, including workplace role, environment, or contact with patients with known COVID-19, were not. These findings provide reassurance that current infection prevention practices in diverse health care settings are effective in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP.","Jacob, Jesse T; Baker, Julia M; Fridkin, Scott K; Lopman, Benjamin A; Steinberg, James P; Christenson, Robert H; King, Brent; Leekha, Surbhi; O039,; Hara, Lyndsay M; Rock, Peter; Schrank, Gregory M; Hayden, Mary K; Hota, Bala; Lin, Michael Y; Stein, Brian D; Caturegli, Patrizio; Milstone, Aaron M; Rock, Clare; Voskertchian, Annie; Reddy, Sujan C; Harris, Anthony D",JAMA Netw Open,,400

We analyse the cumulative growth curves of reported cases and deaths in all Spain and two highly populated regions, Madrid and Catalonia, identifying changes and sudden shifts in their exponential growth rate through segmented Poisson regressions. We associate these breakpoints with a timeline of key events and containment measures, and data on policy stringency and citizen mobility. Results were largely consistent for infections and deaths in all territories, showing four major shifts involving 19-71% reductions in growth rates originating from infections before 3 March and on 5-8, 10-12 and 14-18 March, but no identifiable effect of the strengthened lockdown of 29-30 March. Changes in stringency and mobility were only associated to the latter two shifts, evidencing an early deceleration in COVID-19 spread associated to personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, followed by a stronger decrease when lockdown was enforced, leading to the contention of the outbreak by mid-April. This highlights the importance of combining public health communication strategies and hard confinement measures to contain epidemics.","Santamaría, Luis; Hortal, Joaquín",Epidemiol Infect,,400

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related kidney damage.","Menon, Rajasree; Otto, Edgar A; Sealfon, Rachel; Nair, Viji; Wong, Aaron K; Theesfeld, Chandra L; Chen, Xi; Wang, Yuan; Boppana, Avinash S; Luo, Jinghui; Yang, Yingbao; Kasson, Peter M; Schaub, Jennifer A; Berthier, Celine C; Eddy, Sean; Lienczewski, Chrysta C; Godfrey, Bradley; Dagenais, Susan L; Sohaney, Ryann; Hartman, John; Fermin, Damian; Subramanian, Lalita; Looker, Helen C; Harder, Jennifer L; Mariani, Laura H; Hodgin, Jeffrey B; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Wobus, Christiane E; Naik, Abhijit S; Nelson, Robert G; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Kretzler, Matthias",Kidney Int,,400
399546,Repurposing Immunomodulatory Therapies against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Era of Cardiac Vigilance: A Systematic Review,2020,"The vaccine BCG has been reported to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been hypothesized this is based on nonspecific enhancement of innate immunity. This study addressed whether there is strong homology between a SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein and a Mycobacterium bovis protein that would allow for stronger, more specific immune protection. The study also showed the utility of immunohistochemistry in the diagnostic pathology laboratory for elucidating this information. Immunohistochemistry documented that an antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope, but not the spike or membrane proteins, strongly cross hybridized to 11/11 Mycobacterial species tested, including M. bovis. BlastP analysis showed high homology of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with 12 consecutive amino acids of the protein LytR C, which is a consensus protein unique to Mycobacteria. Six additional cases of human tuberculosis with few organisms showed that the viral envelope specific antibody (5/6) was more accurate than the AFB stain (2/6) for diagnostic purposes. These data indicate BCG vaccination induces a specific immunity against SARS CoV-2 that targets the viral envelope protein that is essential for infectivity. Thus, a concurrent booster or first use of the BCG vaccine may reduce the severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The data also suggests the value of using the SARS-CoV-2 envelope antibody in the diagnosis of Mycobacterial infections in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues by the diagnostic pathologist.","Nuovo, Gerard; Tili, Esmerina; Suster, David; Matys, Eva; Hupp, Lance; Magro, Cynthia",Ann Diagn Pathol,,400

401027,Engel in the Time of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic warrants operational initiatives to minimize transmission, particularly among cancer patients who are thought to be at high-risk. Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures, and quarantines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020-04/22/2020). RESULTS: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (4 warranting intensive care), and 2 died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1-4) to &#8804;1-day (P < 0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75-5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1-2) [P < 0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3-6.5) through prolonged close contact. During this timeframe, 39 care-team members were quarantined for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2-11), with a peak of 17 employees simultaneously quarantined. Following implementation of a ""dual PPE policy,"" newly quarantined employees decreased from 2.9 to 0.5 per day. CONCLUSION: The severe adverse events noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are vulnerable to COVID-19. Active tracking, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive source control can mitigate the adverse effects on treatment delays, workforce incapacitation, and ideally outcomes.","Ning, Matthew S; McAleer, Mary Frances; Jeter, Melenda D; Minsky, Bruce D; Ghafar, Robert A; Robinson, Ivy J; Nitsch, Paige L; Zaebst, Denise J; Todd, Sarah E; Nguyen, Jennifer; Lin, Steven H; Liao, Zhongxing; Lee, Percy; Gunn, G Brandon; Klopp, Ann H; Dabaja, Bouthaina S; Nguyen, Quynh-Nhu; Chronowski, Gregory M; Bloom, Elizabeth S; Koong, Albert C; Das, Prajnan",Radiother Oncol,,400

SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements were assessed as correlates of COVID-19 risk and as correlates of protection. MethodsThrough case-cohort sampling, participants were selected for measurement of four serum antibody markers at Day 1 (first dose), Day 29 (second dose), and Day 57: IgG binding antibodies (bAbs) to Spike, bAbs to Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50% and 80% inhibitory dilution pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers calibrated to the WHO International Standard (cID50 and cID80). Participants with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cox regression assessed in vaccine recipients the association of each Day 29 or 57 serologic marker with COVID-19 through 126 or 100 days of follow-up, respectively, adjusting for risk factors. ResultsDay 57 Spike IgG, RBD IgG, cID50, and cID80 neutralization levels were each inversely correlated with risk of COVID-19: hazard ratios 0.66 (95% CI 0.50, 0.88; p=0.005); 0.57 (0.40, 0.82; p=0.002); 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p<0.001); 0.35 (0.20, 0.61; p<0.001) per 10-fold increase in marker level, respectively, multiplicity adjusted P-values 0.003-0.010. Results were similar for Day 29 markers (multiplicity adjusted P-values <0.001-0.003). For vaccine recipients with Day 57 reciprocal cID50 neutralization titers that were undetectable (<2.42), 100, or 1000, respectively, cumulative incidence of COVID-19 through 100 days post Day 57 was 0.030 (0.010, 0.093), 0.0056 (0.0039, 0.0080), and 0.0023 (0.0013, 0.0036). For vaccine recipients at these titer levels, respectively, vaccine efficacy was 50.8% (-51.2, 83.0%), 90.7% (86.7, 93.6%), and 96.1% (94.0, 97.8%). Causal mediation analysis estimated that the proportion of vaccine efficacy mediated through Day 29 cID50 titer was 68.5% (58.5, 78.4%). ConclusionsBinding and neutralizing antibodies correlated with COVID-19 risk and vaccine efficacy and likely have utility in predicting mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against COVID-19.

401608,Impact of Coronavirus Disease on Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers: An Audit Study,2020,"This study examines whether a stay-at-home order with penalties would be an effective measure for regulating public behavior during a pandemic lockdown, through an online experiment conducted in Japan. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, authorities around the world have taken measures to limit civil liberties by means of stay-at-home orders, with penalties for infractions. In contrast, Japan has avoided legal sanctions and sought voluntary cooperation from the public. This self-restraint request might work to deter public activity in Japan, whose society is known for conformity and social order. Nevertheless, the study found that penalties do make a difference in the intention to stay home, especially in places with high infection rates, such as Tokyo. This piece of evidence could contribute to a broader discourse on what sort of measures to take to encourage public cooperation or compliance and how to balance civil liberties and national health. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aoki, N.",International Journal of Public Administration,,400

In this paper, we discussed the evolution of China's COVID-19 quarantine approach, compared the blanket quarantine in Wuhan and the distant centralized quarantine in rural areas of Shijiazhuang, and analyzed the important issues which authorities will have to pay attention to ensure success from the moment they begin to take close contacts to the single room isolation in a distant quarantine center. The large-scale distant centralized quarantine strategy in Shijiazhuang cut off the transmission of COVID-19 within 1 month. This strategy may inform other countries and regions of a feasible and effective approach to combat the global pandemic of COVID-19.","Wang, Baona; Zheng, Hui",Infection,,400

Propaganda, in the form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th century. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media that it has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming major societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in social media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in mind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of propaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus of 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can appear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows that understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these techniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several state-of-the-art multimodal models.","Dimitrov, Dimitar; Ali, Bishr Bin; Shaar, Shaden; Alam, Firoj; Silvestri, Fabrizio; Firooz, Hamed; Nakov, Preslav; Martino, Giovanni Da San",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08013v1.pdf,400

Consequently, it spreads across the globe and is affecting wellbeing frameworks and the global economy. This pandemic disease places a heavy burden on governments in general, so individuals must adhere to WHO's instructions to limit its spread. The current study was applied to find out the extent of commitment among the Iraqi people to the standards of prevention measures against the coronavirus. Materials and Methods A cross sectional study was conducted with 1153 respondents widely in all governorates of Iraq to identify the commitment of the Iraqis to the preventive measures against COVID-19 in Iraq. This study covered the Iraqis in three main regions (Southern, middle, and Northern) for data collection. It was conducted between the 17th and 25th of March 2020, and Iraqis were administered with a structured questionnaire comprising of three domains. Results The results showed that the majority of the respondents (52%) were female, and most of them (42.3%) were observed between the age group of 31-40 years. About 82% of the respondents were residents of urban areas. Conclusion This study reveals the excellent implementation of preventive measures by the population.

Vaccines have now appeared, but the challenges in producing sufficient material and distributing them around the world means that effective treatments to limit infection and improve recovery are still urgently needed. This review is focused on the relevance of different glycobiological molecules that could potentially serve as or inspire therapeutic tools during SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, we highlight the glycobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, where glycans on viral proteins and on host glycosaminoglycans have critical roles in efficient infection. We also take notice of the glycan-binding proteins involved in the infective capacity of virus and in human defense. In addition, we critically evaluate the glycobiological contribution of candidate drugs for COVID-19 therapy such as glycans for vaccines, anti-glycan antibodies, recombinant lectins, lectin inhibitors, glycosidase inhibitors, polysaccharides, and numerous glycosides, emphasizing some opportunities to repurpose FDA-approved drugs. For the next generation drugs suggested here, biotechnological engineering making new probes to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be based in the essential glycobiological insight on glycosyltransferases, glycans, glycan-binding proteins and glycosidases related to this pathology.","Lardone, Ricardo D; Garay, Yohana C; Parodi, Pedro; Fuente, Sofia de la; Angeloni, Genaro; Bravo, Eduardo O; Schmider, Anneke K; Irazoqui, Fernando J",J Biol Chem,,400

Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. METHODOLOGY: Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that thoracic ultrasound was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. RESULTS: We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the 2groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as thoracic ultrasound, and the ultrasound scores. The best area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained with the 14-area score, with a result of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99). Its sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 13.5 were 100% and 61.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scores to quantify lung involvement measured by thoracic ultrasound provides useful information, facilitating risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Ramos Hernández, Cristina; Botana Rial, Maribel; Pazos Area, Luis Alberto; Núñez Fernández, Marta; Pérez Fernández, Silvia; Rubianes González, Martín; Crespo Casal, Manuel; Fernández Villar, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

This raises significant concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of protection elicited after primary infection and/or from vaccines derived from single virus Spike (S) genotypes, as well as the efficacy of anti-S monoclonal antibody based therapeutics. Here, we used fully human polyclonal human IgG (SAB-185), derived from hyperimmunization of transchromosomic bovines with DNA plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Wa-1 strain S protein or purified ectodomain of S protein, to examine the neutralizing capacity of SAB-185 in vitro and the protective efficacy of passive SAB-185 antibody (Ab) transfer in vivo. The Ab preparation was tested for neutralization against five variant SARS-CoV-2 strains: Munich (Spike D614G), UK (B.1.1.7), Brazil (P.1) and SA (B.1.3.5) variants, and a variant isolated from a chronically infected immunocompromised patient (Spike {Delta}144-146). For the in vivo studies, we used a new human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic Syrian hamster model that exhibits lethality after SARS-Cov-2 challenge and the Munich, UK, SA and {Delta}144-146 variants. SAB-185 neutralized each of the SARS-CoV-2 strains equivalently on Vero E6 cells, however, a control convalescent human serum sample was less effective at neutralizing the SA variant. In the hamster model, prophylactic SAB-185 treatment protected the hamsters from fatal disease and minimized clinical signs of infection. These results suggest that SAB-185 may be an effective treatment for patients infected with SARS CoV-2 variants.","Gilliland, Theron; Liu, Yanan; Li, Rong; Dunn, Matthew; Cottle, Emily; Terada, Yutaka; Ryckman, Zachary; Alcorn, Maria; Vasilatos, Shauna; Lundy, Jeneveve D.; Larson, Deanna; Wu, Hua; Luke, Thomas; Bausch, Christoph; Egland, Kristi; Sullivan, Eddie; Wang, Zhongde; Klimstra, William",,,400

Student nurses in their last year at university were employed to help the National Health System respond to the COVID-19 crisis. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore and understand the experience of nursing students' roles as healthcare aid in responding to the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenology design was used to explore undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of their experiences as HAs during the COVID-19 outbreak. Open face-to-face interviews were conducted to nursing students (n = 10) in May 2020. Data was analyzed using the hermeneutic interpretative approach. RESULTS: All participants were women aged between 21 and 25 years. Seven main themes emerged: learning, ambivalent emotions and adaptation were classified at a personal level; teamwork, patient communication, and unclear care processes were categorized under hospital structure; and coping mechanisms were part of external factors.

Among this rapidly growing population depression is a common and serious health problem; however, there are shortcomings in the diagnosis of depression and provision of psychotherapy. Despite growing evidence in treating depression among the group of nursing home residents or the ""young-old"", there is a research gap regarding needs-oriented healthcare strategies for very old, frail or care-dependent older adults living at home. The present article provides an overview of different outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for vulnerable older adults with depression, in particular adaptations tailored to those who are homebound or in need of care. Based on the current state of research, this article derives recommendations for psychotherapy in this special setting to consider the physical and psychosocial resources of this patient group. Furthermore, healthcare strategies for embedding psychotherapy in collaborative, telehealth or home-delivered healthcare services are described and their applicability as psychosocial support for older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed. Psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for depression in home-living vulnerable older adults. Further implementing telehealth or home delivered settings, individually tailored psychotherapeutic approaches as well as collaborative and stepped care approaches can increase utilization and medical supply of this patient group.

Despite the several bedsides- to- bench investigations carried out by researchers all over the world to identify the best prophylactic and therapeutic options for this deadly virus, no novel vaccine or treatment drug has been developed. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. The hallmark of this unregulated inflammatory response includes viral sepsis, pneumonitis shock, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. In the midst of cytokine storm and coagulopathy, anti-viral agents alone will not provide the much needed therapeutic effect. Hence, the need to combine anti-inflammatory agents such as interferons, angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitors, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK) family inhibitors, anticoagulants and other agents involved in inflammation resolution. This review critically presented a comprehensive overview of SAR-CoV2, unveiled the mechanisms of the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV2 and also highlighted possible specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that will circumvent inflammatory induced deaths in COVID -19 patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the well- -being of the seafarers during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and their evaluation of the precautions taken by the shipping companies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two seafarers completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) with three extra questions on how the COVID-19 precautions were taken on board. RESULTS: The mean Likert score was 13.9 for the whole sample, corresponding to ""no problems"" while a subgroup of 40% had mean Likert sum scores of 16.1 (level 15-23) corresponding to ""starting problems."" In response to the extra items, 50% of the seafarers did not feel safe doing their job in relation to the epidemic and 60% did not think everything has been done to ensure their health at work in relation to the epidemic. Thirty per cent suffered of insomnia to the extent of becoming concerned and 26% had been unhappy and depressed during the latest tours of duty.

It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI.","Li, Ting; Tong, Weida; Roberts, Ruth; Liu, Zhichao; Thakkar, Shraddha",Chem Res Toxicol,,400

Although mortality rates have been high in LTCF residents there is little information regarding the features of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity after infection in this setting or how this may influence immunity to other infections. We studied humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in 152 LTCF staff and 124 residents over a prospective 4-month period shortly after the first wave of infection and related viral serostatus to heterologous immunity to other respiratory viruses and systemic inflammatory markers. LTCF residents developed high levels of antibodies against spike protein and RBD domain which were stable over 4 months of follow up. Nucleocapsid-specific responses were also elevated in elderly donors but showed waning across all populations. Antibodies showed stable and equivalent levels of functional inhibition against spike-ACE2 binding in all age groups with comparable activity against viral variants of concern. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors showed high levels of antibodies to other beta-coronaviruses but serostatus did not impact humoral immunity to influenza or RSV. SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses were equivalent across the life course but virus-specific populations showed elevated levels of activation in older donors. LTCF residents who are survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus show robust and stable immunity which does not impact responses to other seasonal viruses. These findings augur well for relative protection of LTCF residents to re-infection. Furthermore, they underlie the potent influence of previous infection on the immune response to Covid-19 vaccine which may prove to be an important determinant of future vaccine strategy.

This resulted in a severe worldwide shortage of devices and the need to increase import and activate production of safe and effective surgical masks at the national level. In order to support the demand for testing surgical masks in the Italian context, Universities provided their contribution by setting up laboratories for testing mask performance before releasing products into the national market. This paper reports the effort of seven Italian university laboratories who set up facilities for testing face masks during the emergency period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measurement set-ups were built, adapting the methods specified in the EN 14683:2019+AC. Data on differential pressure (DP) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) of 120 masks, including different materials and designs, were collected over three months. More than 60% of the masks satisfied requirements for DP and BFE set by the standard. Masks made of nonwoven polypropylene with at least three layers (spunbonded-meltblown-spunbonded) showed the best results, ensuring both good breathability and high filtration efficiency. The majority of the masks created with alternative materials and designs did not comply with both standard requirements, resulting in suitability only as community masks.

The 'pre-peer-review' publication model is likely to become common as a lag in publishing is not acceptable in a pandemic or other time! Mycopathologia is well placed to adopt such changes with its improved editorial processes, article formats, author engagements, and published articles' access and citation. Mycopathologia had an improved journal impact factor and article downloads in 2018-2019. A limited sampling suggested a slight decrease in the total submissions in 2019 (352 articles) compared to 2018 (371 articles). However, the acceptance rate improved to 30% in 2019 from 19% in 2018. Nearly half of all submissions in 2019 were rejected before peer-review or transferred to other Springer Nature journals. The published articles were contributed from 34 different countries, with authors from China, the USA, and Brazil among the top three contributors. An enhanced editorial oversight allowed peer-reviewers to focus on fewer articles that were well-matched to their expertise, which led to lower rejection rates post-peer-review.

The New Zealand Government’s response in general, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s leadership in particular, came to stand as an example of functional governance to a world experiencing the accelerating fragmentation of Western neo-liberal geo-political economy. The ‘spectacle of competence’ that has characterized Ardern’s leadership is bound up in a pre-existing set of political fault lines that the pandemic has served to amplify. New Zealand’s geo-political cultural position, and the competence (both spectacular and actual) that its leadership has come to represent reveal something of the fracture of political economy of the global North and West, not least because the construction of New Zealand as representing a successful ‘Western’ response is geographically, economically and culturally inaccurate. Contrasting the New Zealand government’s pandemic response to the failed responses of Western models of governance, this piece argues that Jacinda Ardern’s leadership is important, not because it represents an example of Western success but rather because it represents a departure from the deadly consequences of neo-liberal norms.","Gurevitch, Leon",Cultural Studies,,400

The discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins has expanded the applications of genetic research in thousands of laboratories across the globe and is redefining our approach to gene therapy. Traditional gene therapy has raised some concerns, as its reliance on viral vector delivery of therapeutic transgenes can cause both insertional oncogenesis and immunogenic toxicity. While viral vectors remain a key delivery vehicle, CRISPR technology provides a relatively simple and efficient alternative for site-specific gene editing, obliviating some concerns raised by traditional gene therapy. Although it has apparent advantages, CRISPR/Cas9 brings its own set of limitations which must be addressed for safe and efficient clinical translation. This review focuses on the evolution of gene therapy and the role of CRISPR in shifting the gene therapy paradigm. We review the emerging data of recent gene therapy trials and consider the best strategy to move forward with this powerful but still relatively new technology.","Uddin, Fathema; Rudin, Charles M; Sen, Triparna",Front Oncol,,400

More than thousand new COVID-19 infections are getting reported daily for this virus across the globe. Thus, the medical research communities are trying to find the remedy to restrict the spreading of this virus, while the vaccine development work is still under research in parallel. In such critical situation, not only the medical research community, but also the scientists in different fields like microbiology, pharmacy, bioinformatics and data science are also sharing effort to accelerate the process of vaccine development, virus prediction, forecasting the transmissible probability and reproduction cases of virus for social awareness. With the similar context, in this article, we have studied sequence variability of the virus primarily focusing on three aspects: (a) sequence variability among SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in human host, which are in the same coronavirus family, (b) sequence variability of SARS-CoV-2 in human host for 54 different countries and (c) sequence variability between coronavirus family and country specific SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human host. For this purpose, as a case study, we have performed topological analysis of 2391 global genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in association with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV using an integrated semi-alignment based computational technique. The results of the semi-alignment based technique are experimentally and statistically found similar to alignment based technique and computationally faster. Moreover, the outcome of this analysis can help to identify the nations with homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 sequences, so that same vaccine can be applied to their heterogeneous human population.","Sarkar, Jnanendra Prasad; Saha, Indrajit; Seal, Arijit; Maity, Debasree; Maulik, Ujjwal",Infect Genet Evol,,400
426707,Practical Challenges of Mask-to-Mask Encounters with Patients with Head and Neck Cancers amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pressure on the United States (US) healthcare system has been increasing due to a combination of aging populations, rising healthcare expenditures and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic Responses are hindered in part by a reliance on a limited supply of highly trained healthcare professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence (AI)-supported software tools that use a conversational ""chatbot"" format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools, with the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large, general population OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by one symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the US METHODS: Population-based descriptive study including all online symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24th, 2019 to February 1st, 2020 User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data RESULTS: A total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66 9%) were completed by female users Mean user age was 34 3 years (SD: 14 4 years), compared to a median age of 37 3 years of the general population The most common initial symptom was 'abdominal pain' (2,060/26,646, 7 7%) A substantial portion (12,357/26,646, 46 4%) was completed outside of typical physician office hours Most users were advised to seek medical care the same day (7,299/26,646, 27 4%) or within 2-3 days (6,301/26,646, 23 6%) Over one quarter of assessments required a high degree of urgency (7,723/26,646, 29 0%) CONCLUSIONS: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, though skewed towards younger and female users Triage recommendations are comparable to those of nurse-staffed phone triage lines While the emergence of COVID-19 increases the enthusiasm for remote medical assessment tools, it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment","Morse, K.

The recycling of respirators is possible in case of critical shortage, but it raises the question of the effectiveness of decontamination as well as the performance of the reused respirators. METHOD: Disposable respirators were subjected to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) treatment at single or successive doses of 60 mJ/cm2 after a short drying cycle (30 min, 70°C). The germicidal efficacy of this treatment was tested by spiking respirators with two staphylococcal bacteriophages (vB_HSa_2002 and P66 phages). The respirator performance was investigated by the following parameters: particle penetration (NaCl aerosol, 10-300 nm), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry and mechanical tensile tests. RESULTS: No viable phage particles were recovered from any of the respirators after decontamination (log reduction in virus titre >3), and no reduction in chemical or physical properties (SEM, particle penetrations <5%-6%) were observed. Increasing the UVGI dose 10-fold led to chemical alterations of the respirator filtration media (FTIR) but did not affect the physical properties (particle penetration), which was unaltered even at 3000 mJ/cm2 (50 cycles). When respirators had been used by healthcare workers and undergone decontamination, they had particle penetration significantly greater than never donned respirators. CONCLUSION: This decontamination procedure is an attractive method for respirators in case of shortages during a SARS pandemic. A successful implementation requires a careful design and particle penetration performance control tests over the successive reuse cycles.","Vernez, David; Save, Jonathan; Oppliger, Anne; Concha-Lozano, Nicolas; Hopf, Nancy B; Niculita-Hirzel, Hélène; Resch, Grégory; Michaud, Véronique; Dorange-Pattoret, Laurie; Charrière, Nicole; Batsungnoen, Kiattisak; Suarez, Guillaume",,,400

Dendritic cells and macrophages are sentinel cells for innate and adaptive immunity that affect the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and these cell types remains unknown. We investigated infection and host responses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages (MDMs) infected by SARS-CoV-2. MoDCs and MDMs were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and protein expression but did not support productive virus replication. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 launched an attenuated interferon response in both cell types and triggered significant proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in MDMs but not moDCs. Investigations suggested that this attenuated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs was associated with viral antagonism of STAT1 phosphorylation. These findings may explain the mild and insidious course of COVID-19 until late deterioration.","Yang, Dong; Chu, Hin; Hou, Yuxin; Chai, Yue; Shuai, Huiping; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Zhang, Xi; Wang, Yixin; Hu, Bingjie; Huang, Xiner; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhou, Jie; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J Infect Dis,,400

Face recognition is the technique to identify a person identity after face detection. Extensive research has been done on these topics. Another important research problem is to detect concealed faces, especially in high-security places like airports or crowded places like concerts and shopping centres, for they may prevail security threat. Also, in order to help effectively in preventing the spread of Coronavirus, people should wear masks during the pandemic especially in the entrance to hospitals and medical facilities. Surveillance systems in medical facilities should issue warnings against unmasked people. This paper presents a novel technique for concealed face detection based on complexion detection to challenge a concealed face assumption. The proposed algorithm first determine of the existence of a human being in the surveillance scene. Head and shoulder contour will be detected. The face will be clustered to cluster patches. Then determination of presence or absent of human skin will be determined. We proposed a hybrid approach that combines normalized RGB (rgb) and the YCbCr space color. This technique is tested on two datasets; the first one contains 650 images of skin patches. The second dataset contains 800 face images. The algorithm achieves an average detection rate of 97.51% for concealed faces. Also, it achieved a run time comparable with existing state-of-the-art concealed face detection systems that run in real time.","Hosni Mahmoud, Hanan A; Mengash, Hanan Abdullah",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,,400

Since mRNA encodes the amino acid sequence of the protein to be expressed, it is attracting attention as biomedical material exemplified as a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. During the fibrin gel formation by the catalytic activity of thrombin, the thrombin aptamer unit enables the internalization of bApt into fibrin gel. Since another aptamer unit, which is interacting with the drug molecule, can be easily exchanged depending on the therapeutic target, the assembled fibrin gel can be a biocompatible material that stores and releases various drug molecules [7]. [...]the assembly of Puf family proteins on the 3′ untranslated region of mRNA affects protein expression. Since the target RNA sequence of the Puf family proteins can be altered by rationally designing amino acids in their RNA binding domain, a strategy that assembles multiple Puf proteins on target mRNA would enable the efficient regulation of protein expression. Since the strong suppression was observed only when the four types of TTP-PUF fusion proteins are present as it is like a logic gate, the technology is expected to be applied as a gene regulation tool in the field of synthetic biology.","Endoh, Tamaki Rozners Eriks Ohtsuki Takashi",Applied Sciences,,400

Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study was conducted on children with COVID-19. The data on epidemiologic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory, and radiologic findings of patients were extracted from the hospital information management system records, and patients' forms filled upon admission. Results The median age of children was 121 months, 46.8% of the patients were females and 53.2% were males. Of the 581 children assessed, a total of 222 (38.2%) had positive test results;69 of them (31.1%) were asymptomatic. The median absolute lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were statistically significantly lower in symptomatic children (p = 0.001;p = 0.02). Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio was statistically significantly higher in the symptomatic children (p = 0.001).

This study aims to understand how the measures of lockdown have influenced noise levels, as well as people's perception of sound quality before and after lockdown, including de-escalation. For this purpose, an online survey was carried out. Moreover, the noise linked to the Global Positioning System (GPS) position of each individual respondent was recorded aiming to correlate the noise level with the result of the survey. An average reduction of over 30 dB was observed compared with the sound pressure level before lockdown. Furthermore, it was found that the loudness parameter, together with the overall level, increased as the country started relaxing restrictions. Additionally, results showed that the perception of noise quality changed depending on the phase of de-escalation (p < 0.01), the type of property (p < 0.05), and the outside noise (p < 0.01). Moreover, noise annoyance was determined considering age (p < 0.01), gender (p < 0.05), type of property (p < 0.001), and home refurbishment (p < 0.05). It may be concluded that the most important measure to decrease noise levels is the reduction of traffic noise, through using eco-friendly public transportation or bicycles and limiting nightlife hours.","Redel-Macías, María Dolores; Aparicio-Martinez, Pilar; Pinzi, Sara; Arezes, Pedro; Cubero-Atienza, Antonio José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,400

447483,Protecting Surgical Patient Safety During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUNDS: The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused a large outbreak of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures were implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. METHODS: A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. FINDINGS: The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5-11.5) in the second half of January, reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5-9.5) in the first half of February 2020. We estimate that SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improved at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54-8.33) in Hong Kong. CONCLUSIONS: The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected. Sustaining enforcement in timely detection and other effective control measures are recommended to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ran, Jinjun; Zhao, Shi; Zhuang, Zian; Chong, Marc K C; Cai, Yongli; Cao, Peihua; Wang, Kai; Lou, Yijun; Wang, Weiming; Gao, Daozhou; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H",Int J Infect Dis,,400
447487,Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Encephalopathies and Cerebrovascular Disease: The New Orleans Experience,2020,"This paper presents a smart contract-based solution for autonomous administration of construction progress payments. It bridges the gap between payments (cash flow) and the progress assessments at job sites (product flow) enabled by reality capture technologies and building information modeling (BIM). The approach eliminates the reliance on the centralized and heavily intermediated mechanisms of existing payment applications. The construction progress is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is broadcasted to a smart contract which automates the on-chain payment settlements and the transfer of lien rights. The method was successfully used for processing payments to 7 subcontractors in two commercial construction projects where progress monitoring was performed using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The results show promise for the method's potential for increasing the frequency, granularity, and transparency of payments. The paper is concluded with a discussion of implications for project management, introducing a new model of project as a singleton state machine.","Hamledari, Hesam; Fischer, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15232v2.pdf,400
447634,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and obesity. Impact of obesity and its main comorbidities in the evolution of the disease,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hematoma involves two mechanisms leading to brain injury: the mechanical disruption of adjacent brain tissue by the hematoma and delayed neurological injury. Delayed neurological injury involves perihematomal edema (PHE) formation. Infectious complications following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are a significant contributor to post-ICH recovery. We sought to identify a correlation between PHE volumes and infectious complications following ICH. We also sought to explore the clinical impact of this association. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 143 patients with spontaneous ICH. CT scans were performed on admission, and 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h following admission. Hematoma and PHE volumes were calculated using a semi-automatic method. The absolute PHE volume at each time point and changes in PHE volume (&#916;PHE) were calculated. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured from the obtained blood samples. Neurological deterioration (ND) was assessed in all patients. RESULTS: Infectious complications were associated with &#916;PHE72-24 (P < 0.01), whereas there was no association between infectious complications and &#916;PHE24-3 (P = 0.09) or &#916;PHE3-ad (P = 0.81). There was a positive correlation between &#916;PHE72-24 and NLR (r = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90, P < 0.01) and between &#916;PHE72-24 and CRP levels (r = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92, P < 0.01). The ND rate in the group of patients with infectious complications comorbid with high &#916;PHE72-24 was higher than the other patient groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a correlation between &#916;PHE72-24 and infectious complications after spontaneous ICH, which was associated with markers of systemic inflammation. This phenotype linkage is a negative cascade that drives ND.","Kashiwazaki, Daina; Tomita, Takahiro; Shibata, Takashi; Yamamoto, Shusuke; Hori, Emiko; Akioka, Naoki; Kuwayama, Naoya; Nakatsuji, Yuji; Noguchi, Kyo; Kuroda, Satoshi",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,400

This paper estimates the shares of the fiscal economic packages in two phases as per the shares of the vulnerable workers and number of Covid-19 cases in the Indian states. The recent data on labour market are used from National Sample Survey Organization and data on Covid-19 cases from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This paper recommends alternatively a fiscal stimulus package of Rs. 10 lakh crores (5% of GDP) with an immediate effect to counter the present problems of health, food and unemployment in the pandemic and should be extended to Rs. 24 lakh crores (12% of Indian GDP) to the Indian states for at least 1 year to protect the lives and livelihood of the most vulnerable, informal and migrant workers. The populous and poor states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have higher share of vulnerable workers and highly industrialized states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu have higher number of Covid-19 cases. Due to the unplanned lockdown in India, there has been a surge in Covid-19 cases across the country that in turn led to an increase in vulnerable workers in poor states due to reverse migration from industrialized states to populous and poor states during the pandemic. Furthermore, the paper explains the five significant factors that justify the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy rather than monetary policy.","Thakur, Narender; Kumar, Manik",J Public Aff,,400

MethodsWe conducted a multi-site cross-sectional patient experience survey at thirteen academic primary care teaching practices between May and June of 2020. An anonymized link to an electronic survey was sent to a subset of patients with a valid email address on file; sampling was based on birth month. For each question, the proportion of respondents who selected each response was calculated, followed by a comparison by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-squared tests. ResultsIn total, 7482 participants responded to the survey. Most received care from their primary care clinic during the pandemic (67.7%, 5068/7482), the majority via phone (82.5%, 4195/5086). Among those who received care, 30.53% (1509/4943) stated that they delayed seeking care because of the pandemic. Most participants reported a high degree of comfort with phone (92.4%, 3824/4139), video (95.2%, 238/250) and email or messaging (91.3%, 794/870). However, those reporting difficulty making ends meet, poor or fair health, and arriving in Canada in the last 10 years reported lower levels of comfort with virtual care and fewer wanted their practice to continue offering virtual options after the pandemic. ConclusionsOur study suggest that newcomers, people living with a lower income, and those reporting poor or fair health have a stronger preference and comfort for in-person primary care. Further research should explore potential barriers to virtual care and how these could be addressed.","Agarwal, Payal; Wang, Rick; Meaney, Christopher; Walji, Sakina; Damji, Ali; Toor, Navsheer Gill; Yip, Gina; Elman, Debbie; Florindo, Tiffany; Fung, Susanna; Witty, Melissa; Pham, Thuy Nga; Ramji, Noor; Kiran, Tara",,,400

Both quantitative and qualitative methods have been used for data collection from the year one department of management students of the Université des Mascareignes (UdM). All the students owned smartphones and WhatsApp was already part of the e-routines for communication for both learners and lecturer. It was also found that during the confinement period, this platform with its numerous features helped to create a positive and cordial climate among the students and lecturer, thus creating a sense of belonging through the WhatsApp group. This platform provided the required support towards the successful completion of the set learning objectives. The survey revealed that the majority of students would like to continue using WhatsApp in their educational process post-Covid-19 period too. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Akaloo, N.

456362,Managing emerging challenges of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in dentistry,2020,"The Coronaviridae is a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells and engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction, the FSE-arch, that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA structure-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","Ziv, Omer; Price, Jonathan; Shalamova, Lyudmila; Kamenova, Tsveta; Goodfellow, Ian; Weber, Friedemann; Miska, Eric A",Mol Cell,,400

METHODS: We performed systematic literature search via PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect on articles published between January 1 and July 05, 2020, using the following strategy and key words: ((covid[Title/Abstract]) OR (sars-cov-2[Title/Abstract]) OR (coronavirus[Title/Abstract])) AND (brain[Title/Abstract]). A total of 286 non-duplicate matches were screened for original contributions reporting brain imaging data related to SARS-Cov-2 presentation in adults. RESULTS: The selection criteria were met by 26 articles (including 21 case reports, and 5 cohort studies). The data analysis in a total of 361 patients revealed that brain abnormalities were noted in 124/361 (34%) reviewed cases. Neurologic symptoms were the primary reason for referral for neuroimaging across the studies. Modalities included CT (-angiogram, -perfusion, -venogram), EEG, MRI (-angiogram, functional), and PET. The most frequently reported brain abnormalities were brain white matter (WM) hyperintensities on MRI 66/124 (53% affected cases) and hypodensities on CT (additional 23% affected cases), followed by microhemorrhages, hemorrhages and infarcts, while other types were found in <5% affected cases. WM abnormalities were most frequently noted in bilateral anterior and posterior cerebral WM (50% affected cases). CONCLUSION: About a third of acute/subacute COVID-19 patients referred for neuroimaging show brain abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19-related etiology. The predominant neuroimaging features were diffuse cerebral WM hypodensities / hyperintensities attributable to leukoencephalopathy, leukoaraiosis or rarefield WM.","Egbert, Anna Rita; Cankurtaran, Sadiye; Karpiak, Stephen",Brain Behav Immun,,400
461555,A Well-Structured Follow-Up Program is Required after Recovery from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19);Release from Quarantine is Not the End of Treatment,2021,"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have faced unprecedented challenges in the delivery of surgical education. At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped classroom approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations, to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of face-to-face instruction. Our objective is to delineate an interdisciplinary strategy, utilizing the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), by which we can optimize learning during this pandemic. DESIGN: This perspective describes the UDL framework which can be used to situate solutions to issues with delivery of surgical education during this pandemic within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design to meet diverse learning needs.. CONCLUSION: The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities, motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three areas: expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing learning through available distance learning technologies.","Dickinson, Karen J; Gronseth, Susie L",J Surg Educ,,400

Therefore, an increasing amount of research attention has been paid to this emerging area and considerable progress has been made. In this survey, we propose a new taxonomy of existing basic KT models from a technical perspective and provide a comprehensive overview of these models in a systematic manner. In addition, many variants of KT models have been proposed to capture more complete learning process. We then review these variants involved in three phases of the learning process: before, during, and after the student learning, respectively. Moreover, we present several typical applications of KT in different educational scenarios. Finally, we provide some potential directions for future research in this fast-growing field.","Liu, Qi; Shen, Shuanghong; Huang, Zhenya; Chen, Enhong; Zheng, Yonghe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15106v2.pdf,400

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations and explore the relationships among the 6 main cutaneous phenotypes and systemic findings. METHODS: Twenty-one Italian Dermatology Units were asked to collect the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data of 200 patients with COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: A chilblain-like acral pattern was significantly associated with a younger age (P < .0001) and, after adjusting for age, significantly associated with less severe COVID-19 (P = .0009). However, the median duration of chilblain-like lesions was significantly longer than that of the other cutaneous manifestations taken together (P < .0001). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 were more represented than those with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 among the patients with cutaneous manifestations other than chilblain-like lesions, but only the confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform phenotype was significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 (P = .015), and this significance disappeared after adjustment for age. LIMITATIONS: Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not possible in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for age, there was no clear-cut spectrum of COVID-19 severity in patients with COVID-19-related skin manifestations, although chilblain-like acral lesions were more frequent in younger patients with asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic COVID-19.","Marzano, Angelo Valerio; Genovese, Giovanni; Moltrasio, Chiara; Gaspari, Valeria; Vezzoli, Pamela; Maione, Vincenzo; Misciali, Cosimo; Sena, Paolo; Patrizi, Annalisa; Offidani, Annamaria; Quaglino, Pietro; Arco, Renato; Caproni, Marzia; Rovesti, Miriam; Bordin, Giorgio; Recalcati, Sebastiano; Potenza, Concetta; Guarneri, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Tomasini, Carlo; Sorci, Mariarita; Lombardo, Maurizio; Gisondi, Paolo; Conti, Andrea; Casazza, Giovanni; Peris, Ketty; Calzavara-Pinton, Piergiacomo; Berti, Emilio",J Am Acad Dermatol,,400

This disease can be fatal. Seniors, and people with other medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease ), may be more vulnerable and become seriously ill. This is why research into drugs to treat this infection remains essential in several research laboratories. Natural herbal remedies have long been the main, if not the only, remedy in the oral tradition for treating illnesses. Modern medicine has known its success thanks to traditional medicine, the effectiveness of which derives from medicinal plants. The objective of this study is to determine if the components of natural origin have an anti-viral effect and which can prevent humans from infection by this coronavirus using the most reliable method is molecular docking, which used to find the interaction between studied molecules and the protein, in our case we based on the inhibitor of Coronavirus (nCoV-2019) main protease.

467402,Usefulness of serial lung ultrasound for a severe COVID-19 patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the end of December 2019, the world in general and Wuhan, the industrial hub of China, in particular, experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Massive increment of cases and deaths occurred in China and 209 countries in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and Pakistan. Pakistan was first hit by COVID-19 when a case was reported in Karachi on 26 February 2020. Several methods were presented to model the death rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast the pinnacle of reported deaths. Still, these methods were not used in identifying the first day when Pakistan enters or exits the early exponential growth phase. OBJECTIVE: The present study intends to monitor variations in deaths and identify the growth phases such as pre-growth, growth, and post-growth phases in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: New approaches are needed that display the death patterns and signal an alarming situation so that corrective actions can be taken before the condition worsens. To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered, and the $c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are used To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered. The $ c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been used for monitoring variations. RESULTS: The chart shows that Pakistan switches from the pre-growth to the growth phase on 31 March 2020. The EWMA chart demonstrates that Pakistan remains in the growth phase from 31 March 2020 to 17 August 2020, with some indications signaling a decrease in deaths. It is found that Pakistan moved to a post-growth phase for a brief period from 27 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. Pakistan switches to re-growth phase with an alarm on 31/7/2020, right after the short-term post-growth phase. The number of deaths starts decreasing in August in that Pakistan may approach the post-growth phase shortly. CONCLUSION: This amalgamation of control charts illustrates a systematic implementation of the charts for government leaders and forefront medical teams to facilitate the rapid detection of daily reported deaths due to COVID-19. Besides government and public health officials, it is also the public's responsibility to follow the enforced standard operating procedures as a temporary remedy of this pandemic in ensuring public safety while awaiting a suitable vaccine to be discovered.","Mahmood, Yasar; Ishtiaq, Sunaina; Khoo, Michael B C; Teh, Sin Yin; Khan, Hina",Int. j. qual. health care,,400

In this light, summarise the most recent advances in CA for COVID-19 speech and/or sound analysis. While the milestones achieved are encouraging, there are yet not any solid conclusions that can be made. This comes mostly, as data is still sparse, often not sufficiently validated and lacking in systematic comparison with related diseases that affect the respiratory system.

476890,Disseminated Inflammatory Lesions in 2 COVID-19 Patients: Challenge,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to the need to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible. As pregnant women are at increased risk of contracting severe COVID-19, with higher mortality, it is essential to assess the safety of the vaccines administered during pregnancy. Methods: The aim of this study was to determine the titer of specific maternal and cord antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 S protein after antenatal vaccination. The secondary objective was to evaluate the ratio of the umbilical cord to the maternal antibody titers. Patients included in the study were enrolled after undergoing voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy at different weeks of gestation. All patients analyzed in our initial study were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The results of the current study document high anti-S total IgG antibody titers in cord serum at birth in all mother–infant pairs analyzed. The mean umbilical cord blood sample IgG antibody titer anti-S protein was 1026.51 U/mL (±SD 769.25). The mean cord-to-maternal anti–S IgG antibody ratio was 1.28 (±SD 0.798). A significant positive correlation was observed between the week of gestation at which the first dose was administered and the week of gestation at which the second dose was administered, and the respective cord-to-maternal ratio (r = 0.48;p = 0.0029) for the first dose and (r = 0.39;p = 0.0102) for the second dose. Conclusions: To date, despite the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination, there is a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccination of pregnant women. Therefore, the results we present are complementary. Our study suggests that maternal immunization may provide neonatal protection through the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Of particular importance is the demonstration that antibody transfer is correlated with the time from vaccination to delivery, which may allow future determination of the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.","Zdanowski, Wojciech Waśniewski Tomasz",Vaccines,,400
477140,Reply to: 'The hyperdynamic circulatory profile of patients with COVID-19-related acute vascular distress syndrome',2021,"INTRODUCTION: A year after the emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as a new crisis in respiratory infections, there remain many uncertainties and unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. Although COVID-19 is known as respiratory disease, some atypical manifestations have been seen, different from those seen in other types of viral respiratory infections. This paper aims to describe designing, launching, and implementing a data collection system for all respiratory diseases, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 from the onset of this pandemic. METHOD: The current registry is designed in compliance with the standard Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, along with the declaration of Helsinki principles. RESULTS: A respiratory disease registry, with an emphasis on COVID-19 and other co-infections, was developed. Data consisted of demographic, clinical, and supporting information about SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral diseases. CONCLUSION: It is hoped that the current data registry will facilitate patient evaluation and improve the outcomes of cases of respiratory infection defined by a particular condition, disease, or exposure. Moreover, the registry can harmonize data about the treatment, outcomes, and well-being of patients who receive care over time, and identify best practices.","Emami, Amir; Akbari, Ali; Javanmardi, Fatemeh; Lotfi, Mehrzad; Moghadami, Mohsen; Sharifi, Mehrdad; Bakhtiari, Hamid; Falahati, Farshad",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,400
477570,Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Meta-Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 studies are primarily from the inpatient setting, skewing towards severe disease. Race and comorbidities predict hospitalization, however, ambulatory presentation of milder COVID-19 disease and characteristics associated with progression to severe disease is not well-understood. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review including all COVID-19 positive cases from Stanford Health Care (SHC) in March 2020 to assess demographics, comorbidities and symptoms in relationship to: 1) their access point of testing (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room (ER)) and 2) development of severe disease. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-seven patients tested positive: 127 (49%), 96 (37%), and 34 (13%) at outpatient, ER and inpatient, respectively. Overall, 61% were age < 55; age > 75 was rarer in outpatient setting (11%) than ER (14%) or inpatient (24%). Most patients presented with cough (86%), fever/chills (76%), or fatigue (63%). 65% of inpatients reported shortness of breath compared to 30-32% of outpatients and ER patients. Ethnic/minority patients had a significantly higher risk of developing severe disease (Asian OR = 4.8 [1.6-14.2], Hispanic OR = 3.6 [1.1-11.9]). Medicare-insured patients were marginally more likely (OR = 4.0 [0.9-17.8]). Other factors associated with developing severe disease included kidney disease (OR = 6.1 [1.0-38.1]), cardiovascular disease (OR = 4.7 [1.0-22.1], shortness of breath (OR = 5.4 [2.3-12.6]) and GI symptoms (OR = 3.3 [1.4-7.7]; hypertension without concomitant CVD or kidney disease was marginally significant (OR = 2.3 [0.8-6.5]). CONCLUSIONS: Early widespread symptomatic testing for COVID-19 in Silicon Valley included many less severely ill patients. Thorough manual review of symptomatology reconfirms the heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms, and challenges in using clinical characteristics to predict decline. We re-demonstrate that socio-demographics are consistently associated with severity.","Vaughan, Laura; Veruttipong, Darlene; Shaw, Jonathan G; Levy, Noemie; Edwards, Lauren; Winget, Marcy",BMC Infect Dis,,400

METHODS: We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison. RESULTS: We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model run.DiscusssionOur model allowed us to shape our health system's executive policy response to implement a 'hospital within a hospital'-one for patients with COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population. The surgical scheduleis modified according to models that predict the number of new patients withCovid-19 who require admission. This enabled our hospital to coordinateresources to continue to support the community at large. Challenges includedthe need to frequently adjust or create new models to meet rapidly evolvingrequirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs ofmultiple stakeholders. The model we created can be adapted to other health systems,provide a mechanism to predict local peaks in cases and inform hospitalleadership regarding bed allocation, surgical volumes, staffing, and suppliesone for COVID-19 patients within a hospital able to care for the regularnon-COVID-19 population. CONCLUSION: Predictive models are essential tools in supporting decision making when coordinating clinical operations during a pandemic.","Warde, Prem Rajendra; Patel, Samira; Ferreira, Tanira; Gershengorn, Hayley; Bhatia, Monisha Chakravarthy; Parekh, Dipen; Manni, Kymberlee; Shukla, Bhavarth",,,400

It is also common following surgery and an indicator of brain vulnerability and risk for the development of dementia. In this work we analyzed the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in the postoperative setting using metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid and blood taken from the same patients prior to planned orthopaedic surgery. Distance correlation analysis and Random Forest (RF) feature selection were used to determine changes in metabolic networks. We found significant concentration differences in several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines linking delirium-prone patients to known factors in Alzheimer's disease such as monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) protein. Subsequent computational structural comparison between MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as well as protein-protein docking analysis showed that there potentially is strong binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MAOB. The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity leading to the observed neurological and platelet-based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further investigation.","Cuperlovic-Culf, Miroslava; Cunningham, Emma L; Teimoorinia, Hossen; Surendra, Anuradha; Pan, Xiaobei; Bennett, Steffany A L; Jung, Mijin; McGuiness, Bernadette; Passmore, Anthony Peter; Beverland, David; Green, Brian D",Sci Rep,,400

Previously, microRNA (miR)-148b-3p has been found to be upregulated in bladder cancers as well as in body fluids (blood, urine) of bladder cancer patients. Here, we aimed to explore the role of CAF-derived exosome miR-148b-3p in bladder cancer progression and chemosensitivity. METHODS: Transwell, MTT, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of CAF-derived exosomes on bladder cancer cell metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemosensitivity. A dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to evaluate the targeting relationship between miR-148b-3p and PTEN. Gain- and loss- of function assays were conducted to explore the roles of miR-148b-3p and PTEN in the behavior of bladder cancer cells. The role of PTEN in the metastasis, EMT and chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells was assessed both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: We found that CAF-derived exosomes promoted the metastasis, EMT and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. We also found that CAF-derived exosomes could directly transport miR-148b-3p into bladder cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model we found that CAF-derived exosomes increased miR-148b-3p expression levels and promoted tumor proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance. PTEN was validated as a target of miR-148b-3p. Concordantly, we found that PTEN overexpression inhibited EMT, metastasis and chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells, reversing the tumor promoting effects of miR-148b-3p via the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that miR-148b-3p downregulation in CAF-derived exosomes, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and promoting PTEN expression, may offer potential opportunities for bladder cancer treatment.","Shan, Guang; Zhou, Xike; Gu, Juan; Zhou, Daoping; Cheng, Wei; Wu, Huaiguo; Wang, Yueping; Tang, Tian; Wang, Xuedong",Cellular oncology (2011.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) protocols are formulary tools that allow for provider-selected interchange from a nonformulary preadmission medication to a formulary equivalent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the application of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ATS can decrease ATS errors at admission, but there are limited data describing the impact of CDS on discharge errors. The objective of this study was to describe the impact of CDS-supported interchanges on discharge prescription duplications or omissions. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients admitted between June 2017 and August 2019 were included if they were 18 years or older at admission, underwent an ATS protocol-approved interchange for 1 of the 9 included medication classes, and had a completed discharge medication reconciliation. The primary outcome was difference in incidence of therapeutic duplication or omission at discharge between the periods before and after CDS implementation. RESULTS: A total of 737 preimplementation encounters and 733 postimplementation encounters were included. CDS did not significantly decrease the incidence of discharge duplications or omissions (12.1% vs 11.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.3% to 4.2%) nor the incidence of admission duplication or inappropriate reconciliation (21.4% vs 20.7%; 95% CI, -3.4% to 4.8%) when comparing the pre- and postimplementation periods. Inappropriate reconciliation was the primary cause of discharge medication errors for both groups. CONCLUSION: CDS implementation was not associated with a decrease in discharge omissions, duplications, or inappropriate reconciliation. Findings highlight the need for thoughtful medication reconciliation at the point of discharge.","Maxwell, Erin; Amerine, James; Carlton, Glenda; Cruz, Jennifer L; Pappas, Ashley L; Heindel, Gregory A",Am. j. health system pharm,,400

When COVID-19 arrived in Brazil, a crisis scenario that incorporated economic, social and political aspects became highly visible. This scenario fostered unemployment, poverty and hunger. Besides that, it exposed multiple vulnerabilities that were getting worse over the past few years prior to the pandemic. In this context, COVID-19 found in Brazil a fertile ground for its dissemination and community transmission. The impacts of the suspension of many commercial activities and other economic sectors due to the pandemic were quickly felt socially and economically in Brazil. Some of the actions carried out by the Brazilian government included the emergency aid payment and exemption from payment of energy bills for vulnerable individuals, release of funds for programmes for the direct purchase of food from family farmers, delivery of school food kits directly to students despite the closure of schools and publication of sanitary rules for the operation of restaurants. However, these actions are still insufficient, slow and not sufficiently coordinated to contain the progress of the food and nutritional insecurity crisis in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgency for the Brazilian government to again prioritise the FNS agenda. This includes implementing mechanisms to ensure the Human Right to Adequate Food and expanding existing FNS programmes.","Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Viola, Poliana Cristina de Almeida Fonseca; Sperandio, Naiara",Public Health Nutr,,400

However, epidemiological studies in ophthalmology are still scarce in Japan, and the sizes of the cohorts are relatively small. ""Ganka-Ekigaku Network"" (GEN, an acronym for the epidemiological network in ophthalmology in Japanese) is established to develop a capacity to boost each epidemiological study and enrich a potential inter-study collaboration to identify risk factors of visual impairment in aged society. METHODS: We reviewed cohort studies in Japan with the inclusion criteria as: (1) at least n = 1000 at baseline, (2) multiple modalities of ophthalmic data, and (3) diagnosis reviewed by ophthalmologist(s), and (4) ophthalmologists are involved in the investigators group. As of January 2020, GEN includes 4 individual Japanese epidemiological studies namely, Hisayama study, Yamagata Study (Funagata), Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort study, and the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. RESULTS: GEN includes approximately 25,000 Japanese participants. The baseline surveys started from 1998 to 2012, and since then the data has been prospectively collected approximately every 5 years. A variety of ophthalmic measurements and other factors have been collected in each study in GEN: ophthalmic measurements (fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, etc.), systemic conditions (laboratory data, etc.), and others (DNA, etc.). CONCLUSION: GEN is an open platform for observational ophthalmic epidemiological studies to share standardized methodologies.

481274,Beyond survival: Practical wellness tips during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic,2020,"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 engages human ACE2 through its spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to enter the host cell. Recent computational studies have reported that withanone and withaferin A, phytochemicals found in Withania somnifera, target viral main protease (MPro) and host transmembrane TMPRSS2, and glucose related protein 78 (GRP78), respectively, implicating their potential as viral entry inhibitors. Absence of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection has encouraged exploration of phytochemicals as potential antivirals. Aim: This study aimed at in silico exploration, along with in vitro and in vivo validation of antiviral efficacy of the phytochemical withanone. Methods: Through molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and electrostatic energy calculation the plausible biochemical interactions between withanone and the ACE2-RBD complex were investigated. These in silico observations were biochemically validated by ELISA-based assays. Withanone-enriched extract from W. somnifera was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinically relevant pathological features, modelled in humanized zebrafish through SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein induction. Results: Withanone bound efficiently at the interacting interface of the ACE2-RBD complex and destabilized it energetically. The electrostatic component of binding free energies of the complex was significantly decreased. The two intrachain salt bridge interactions (K31-E35) and the interchain long-range ion-pair (K31-E484), at the ACE2-RBD interface were completely abolished by withanone, in the 50 ns simulation. In vitro binding assay experimentally validated that withanone efficiently inhibited (IC50=0.33 ng/mL) the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, in a dose-dependent manner. A withanone-enriched extract, without any co-extracted withaferin A, was prepared from W. somnifera leaves. This enriched extract was found to be efficient in ameliorating human-like pathological responses induced in humanized zebrafish by SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study provided experimental validation for computational insight into the potential of withanone as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus entry into the host cells.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Singh, Hoshiyar; Joshi, Monali; Mulay, Vallabh Prakash; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",Drug Des Devel Ther,,400

The COVID-19 pandemic has violently impacted the European continent, first involving only some European countries, Italy in particular, and then spreading to all member states, albeit in different ways and times. The ways SARS-CoV-2 spreads are still partly unknown; to quantify and adequately respond to the pandemic, various parameters and reporting systems have been introduced at national and European levels to promptly recognize the most alarming epidemiological situations and therefore limit the impact of the virus on the health of the population. The relevant key points to implement adequate measures to face the epidemic include identifying the population groups most involved in terms of morbidity and mortality, identifying the events mostly related to the spreading of the virus and recognizing the various viral mutations. The main objective of this work is to summarize the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and Italy almost a year after the first reported case in our continent. The secondary objectives include the definition of the epidemiological parameters used to monitor the epidemic, the explanation of superspreading events and the description of how the epidemic has impacted on health and social structures, with a particular focus on Italy.","Gabutti, Giovanni; d039,; Anchera, Erica; De Motoli, Francesco; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,400

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study within the Vascular Surgery ward in Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte, Portugal. All data from surgical, inpatient and outpatient activity were collected from February to June 2020 and compared to the same 5-month period in 2018 and 2019. We ran a descriptive analysis of all data and performed statistical tests for the variation of procedures and admissions between February and June 2018 and the same time period in 2020. RESULTS: During the outbreak, our staff had to be readapted. Six nurses were transferred to COVID-19 units (out of a total of 33 nurses) while 1 of the 7 residents was transferred to an intensive care unit and 1 senior surgeon was put on prophylactic leave. In the outpatient clinic, there was an increase in the number of telemedicine consultations with a greater focus on first-time referrals and urgent cases. There was a significant increase in the total number of elective admissions whereas there were significantly less admissions from an emergency setting (+57% and -54%, respectively, P < 0.001). The vascular surgery team performed a total number of 584 procedures between February and June 2020 (-17.8% compared to 2018 and 2019), with a significant increase in the number of endovascular procedures (P < 0.001) and in the use of local and regional anesthesia (P < 0.001), especially in the Angio Suite (+600%, P < 0.001). Comparing with 2018 and 2019, the surgical team performed less outpatient procedures in early 2020. We reported a significant increase in the total number of procedures for patients with a chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) diagnosis (+21%, P < 0.001). We did not report significant changes in the proportion of other vascular conditions. Regarding mortality, we observed a 16% decrease in the intraoperative mortality (P 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in daily activity during the contingency period. During the outbreak, there was an overall decline in outpatient clinics and inpatient admissions. Nevertheless, and despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and health authorities, we managed to maintain most procedures for most vascular diseases, particularly for CLTI urgent cases, without a significant increase in the mortality rate. Stringent protective measures for patient and staff or higher use of endovascular techniques and local anesthesia are some of the successful changes implemented in the department. These learned lessons are to be pursued as the pandemic evolves with future outbreaks of COVID-19, such as the current second outbreak currently spreading through Europe.","Duarte, António; Gouveia E Melo, Ryan; Lopes, Alice; Rato, João Pedro; Valente, João; Pedro, Luís Mendes",Ann. vasc. surg,,400
485325,Acute Myocarditis Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019: Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of Reported Cases,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the validity and reliability of two variants of the Sit Up Squat Stand Test (SUSS) and Hand Grip Strength (HGS) in predicting BMI and BMI risk level in hospitalised patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). METHODS: 25 inpatients with AN were tested roughly weekly for up to 16 weeks. Muscle power was assessed by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Intra-class coefficients (ICCs) indicated high Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) for the HGS (10 participants). Cohen's Kappa showed moderate IRR for the SUSS test (25 participants). Stepwise multiple regression showed that the SUSS tests plus HGS predicted BMI and BMI risk level explaining about two-third of the variance. Each test individually had lower predictive value. There was a little difference between the two versions of the SUSS tested. CONCLUSIONS: HGS and SUSS are valid and reliable measurements of muscle power in AN. Together, the SUSS tests and the HGS represent a useful and effective measure of muscle power and hence one aspect of physical risk in Anorexia Nervosa. In the light of Covid restrictions, the SUSS test is one way that physical state can be monitored on video link in a way that is hard to falsify.","Etemadi, Sara; Sun, Grey Xiaoliai; Leung, Sum-Ping; Siddique, Arshad; Cooper, Steven; Ezenwa, Nwabunma Christiana; Treasure, Janet; Robinson, Paul",Eur. eat. disord. rev.

Among these TTE endpoints, overall survival (OS) is always considered as the gold standard. However, OS data can take years to mature, and its use for measurement of efficacy can be confounded by the use of post-treatment rescue therapies or supportive care. Therefore, to accelerate the development process and better characterize the treatment effect of new investigational therapies, other TTE endpoints such as progression-free survival and event-free survival (EFS) are applied as primary efficacy endpoints in some confirmatory trials, either as a surrogate for OS or as a direct measure of clinical benefits. For evaluating novel treatments for acute myeloid leukemia, EFS has been gradually recognized as a direct measure of clinical benefits. However, the application of an EFS endpoint is still controversial mainly due to the debate surrounding definition of treatment failure (TF) events. In this article, we investigate the EFS endpoint with the most conservative definition for the timing of TF, which is Day 1 since randomization. Specifically, the corresponding non-proportional hazard pattern of the EFS endpoint is investigated with both analytical and numerical approaches.","Xu, Tu; Zhang, Yiming; Goldwasser, Meredith; Zhang, Vickie",,,400

Early studies of GR signaling led to broad acceptance of models in which glucocorticoid receptor (GR) monomers tether repressively to inflammatory transcription factors, thus abrogating inflammatory gene expression. However, newer data challenge this core concept and present an exciting opportunity to reframe our understanding of GR signaling. Here, we present an alternate, two-part model for transcriptional repression by glucocorticoids. First, widespread GR-mediated induction of transcription results in rapid, primary repression of inflammatory gene transcription and associated enhancers through competition-based mechanisms. Second, a subset of GR-induced genes, including targets that are regulated in coordination with inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B, exerts secondary repressive effects on inflammatory gene expression. Within this framework, emerging data indicate the gene set regulated through the cooperative convergence of GR and NF-&#954;B signaling is central to the broad clinical effectiveness of glucocorticoids in terminating inflammation and promoting tissue repair.","Gerber, Anthony N; Newton, Robert; Sasse, Sarah K",J Biol Chem,,400

Each sample is assigned into multiple pools using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing. We pooled sets of 384 samples into 48 pools, providing both an eightfold increase in testing efficiency and an eightfold reduction in test costs, while identifying up to five positive carriers. We then used P-BEST to screen 1115 health care workers using 144 tests. P- BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that can be easily integrated into diagnostic laboratories.","Shental, Noam; Levy, Shlomia; Wuvshet, Vered; Skorniakov, Shosh; Shalem, Bar; Ottolenghi, Aner; Greenshpan, Yariv; Steinberg, Rachel; Edri, Avishay; Gillis, Roni; Goldhirsh, Michal; Moscovici, Khen; Sachren, Sinai; Friedman, Lilach M; Nesher, Lior; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Porgador, Angel; Hertz, Tomer",Sci.

AREAS COVERED: Although a massive endothelial disruption is a rare condition, caused by acute and uncontrolled inflammatory responses (e.g., the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection), more frequently the vascular tree is the first target of slowly progressive inflammatory processes which affect the integrity of endothelium and its ""barrier"" function, supporting the onset of atherosclerotic plaque and spreading inflammation. This endothelial dysfunction leads to decrease NO biosynthesis, impaired regulation of vascular tone and increased platelet aggregation. Such a chronic sub-clinic inflammation leads to macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, many efforts should be addressed to find useful approaches to preserve vascular endothelium from inflammation. In this review, the authors have evaluated the most recent strategies to counteract this pathological condition. EXPERT OPINION: The therapeutic and nutraceutical approaches represent useful tools to treat, slow down or prevent different phases of vascular inflammation. In particular, the pharmacological approach should be used in advanced phases characterized by clinical signs of vascular disease, whilst the nutraceutical approach may represent a promising preventive strategy to preserve the integrity of the endothelial tissue.","Martelli, Alma; Citi, Valentina; Calderone, Vincenzo",Expert opin. drug discov.

489996,In-Hospital Management and Outcomes of Acute Myocardial Infarction Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raised concerns that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger thyroid autoimmunity. We aimed to address the current uncertainties regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: We included consecutive adult COVID-19 patients without known thyroid disorders, who were admitted to Queen Mary Hospital from July 21 to September 21, 2020 and had serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Among 20 patients with abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) on admission (mostly low fT3), 15 recovered. Among 102 patients with initial normal TFTs, two had new-onset abnormalities that could represent different phases of thyroiditis. Among 104 patients whose anti-thyroid antibody titers were reassessed, we observed increases in anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (P<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin (P<0.001), but not anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor titers (P=0.486). Of 82 patients with negative anti-TPO findings at baseline, 16 had a significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by >12 U, and four became anti-TPO-positive. Worse baseline clinical severity (P=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (P=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (P=0.005) were associated with a significant increase in anti-TPO titer. CONCLUSION: Most patients with thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis occurred during convalescence, but infrequently. Importantly, our novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19 warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice Ka Hong; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),,400

Till June 10, 2021 India has recorded 29,182,072 COVID cases and 359,695 deaths. A number of factors help to influence COVID-19 transmission rate and prevalence. Accordingly, the present study intended to integrate the climatic parameters, namely ambient air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (H) with population mass (PM) to determine their influence for rapid transmission of COVID-19 in India. The sensibility of AT, H and PM parameters on COVID-19 transmission was investigated based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) classification model. The results depicted that AT and H models have very low sensibility (i.e., lower area under curve value 0.26 and 0.37, respectively compared with AUC value 0.5) to induce virus transmission and discrimination between infected people and healthy ones. Contrarily, PM model is highly sensitive (AUC value is 0.912, greater than AUC value 0.5) towards COVID-19 transmission and discrimination between infected people and healthy ones and approximate population of 2.25 million must impose like social distancing, personal hygiene, etc. as strategic management policy.

This review discusses the technological advances in testing capability and methodology that are currently used or in development for detecting the novel coronavirus. We describe the current clinical diagnostics and technology, including molecular and serological testing approaches, for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing as well as address their advantages and limitations. Nucleic acid amplification technology for molecular diagnostics remains the gold standard for virus detection. We highlight alternative molecular detection techniques used for developing novel COVID-19 diagnostics on the horizon. Antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood and proper validation of serology tests is necessary to demonstrate their accuracy and clinical utility. In order to bring the pandemic under control, we must speed up the development of rapid and widespread testing through improvements in clinical diagnostics and testing technology as well as access to these tools.","Chau, Cindy H; Strope, Jonathan D; Figg, William D",Pharmacotherapy,,400

Whereas age, hypertension, and chronic inflammatory conditions are risk factors, underlying host factors and markers for disease severity, e.g. requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, remain poorly defined. To this end, we longitudinally profiled blood inflammation markers, antibodies, and 101 plasma proteins of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did or did not require ICU admission. While essentially all patients displayed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and virus-neutralization capacity within 12-15 days, a rapid, mostly transient upregulation of selective inflammatory markers including IL-6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFNÎ³, IL-10, and monocyte-attracting CCL2, CCL7 and CCL8, was particularly evident in ICU patients. In addition, there was consistent and sustained upregulation of apoptosis-associated proteins CASP8, TNFSF14, HGF, and TGFB1, with HGF discriminating between ICU and non-ICU cohorts. Thus, COVID-19 is associated with a selective inflammatory milieu within which the apoptotic pathway is a cardinal feature with potential to aid risk-based patient stratification.","Haljasmägi, Liis; Salumets, Ahto; Rumm, Anna Pauliina; Jürgenson, Meeri; Krassohhina, Ekaterina; Remm, Anu; Sein, Hanna; Kareinen, Lauri; Vapalahti, Olli; Sironen, Tarja; Peterson, Hedi; Milani, Lili; Tamm, Anu; Hayday, Adrian; Kisand, Kai; Peterson, Pärt",Sci Rep,,400

All aneurysms were treated using the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) embolisation system, either electively or following subarachnoid haemorrhage. On-site proctoring was not possible due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. WEB placement was feasible in all cases. Good rapport between proctors and treating physicians was reported, enabled by the high-resolution image transmission and uninterrupted feedback/discussion via audiostream. No clinical complications were encountered. Short-term follow-up revealed adequate occlusion of all treated aneurysms. The employed streaming technology provided effective remote proctoring during complex aneurysm cases, including the management of technical complications.","Bechstein, Matthias; Elsheikh, Samer; Wodarg, Fritz; Taschner, Christian A; Hanning, Uta; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; McDonough, Rosalie; Goebell, Einar; Fiehler, Jens; Bester, Maxim",J. neurointerv. surg.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although COVID-19 infection is usually associated with mild disease, it can lead to severe respiratory complications. Little is known about the perioperative outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined patients who underwent urgent and emergent surgery at 2 hospitals in New York City from March 17 to April 15, 2020. Elective surgical procedures were cancelled throughout and routine, laboratory based COVID-19 screening was instituted on April 1. Mortality, complications, and admission to the intensive care unit were compared between patients with COVID-19 detected perioperatively and controls. RESULTS: Among 468 subjects, 36 (7.7%) had confirmed COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 55.6% were detected preoperatively and 44.4% postoperatively. Before the routine preoperative COVID-19 laboratory screening, 7.7% of cases were diagnosed preoperatively compared to 65.2% after institution of screening (P = 0.0008). The perioperative mortality rate was 16.7% in those with COVID-19 compared to 1.4% in COVID-19 negative subjects [aRR = 9.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.68-15.21]. Serious complications were identified in 58.3% of COVID-19 subjects versus 6.0% of controls (aRR = 7.02; 95%CI, 4.96-9.92). Cardiac arrest, sepsis/shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury were more common in those with COVID-19. The intensive care unit admission rate was 36.1% in those with COVID-19 compared to 16.4% of controls (aRR = 1.34; 95%CI, 0.86-2.09). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk for serious perioperative morbidity and mortality. A substantial number of patients with COVID-19 are not identified until after surgery.","Knisely, Anne; Zhou, Zhen Ni; Wu, Jenny; Huang, Yongmei; Holcomb, Kevin; Melamed, Alexander; Advincula, Arnold P; Lalwani, Anil; Khoury-Collado, Fady; Tergas, Ana I; St Clair, Caryn M; Hou, June Y; Hershman, Dawn L; D039,; Alton, Mary E; Huang, Yolanda Ya-Chin; Wright, Jason D",Ann Surg,,400
497043,Prevalence of venous thromboembolic events in novel coronavirus disease-2019 patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"MOTIVATION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 14 million cases and more than half million deaths. Given the absence of implemented therapies, new analysis, diagnosis, and therapeutics are of great importance. RESULTS: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short persistent DNA/RNA sequences that are absent from the human genome and transcriptome (PmRAWs). For the PmRAWs with length 12, only four exist at the same location in all SARS-CoV-2. At the gene level, we found one PmRAW of size 13 at the Spike glycoprotein coding sequence. This protein is fundamental for binding in human ACE2 and further use as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Applying protein structural prediction, we localized this PmRAW at the surface of the Spike protein, providing a potential targeted vector for diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, we show a new pattern of relative absent words (RAWs), characterized by the progressive increase of GC content (Guanine and Cytosine) according to the decrease of RAWs length, contrarily to the virus and host genome distributions. New analysis shows the same property during the Ebola virus outbreak. At a computational level, we improved the alignment-free method to identify pathogen-specific signatures in balance with GC measures and removed previous size limitations.

Our sample period ranges from January 2002 to July 2020, covering the three global crises; Global Financial Crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and Covid-19 pandemic crisis. We employ Granger causality tests, and the static and dynamic connectedness spillover index methodology. We find that the shocks in oil prices are Granger-caused mainly by price changes of grains, live cattle, and wheat, while supply shock granger causes variations mostly in grain prices. We find that, from the point of view of static connectedness, for both, price and volatility spillovers, the livestock is the largest transmitter, while the lean hogs are the major receiver. Our dynamic analysis evidences that connectedness increases during the financial crisis period. Our results are potentially useful for investors, portfolios managers and policy makers.","Umar, Zaghum; Gubareva, Mariya; Naeem, Muhammad; Akhter, Ayesha",PLoS One,,400
497708,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: From transmission to control with an interdisciplinary vision,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human activities, leading to unprecedented decreases in both global energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet a little known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system in 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related GHG emissions from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system, representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand (-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in 2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%). Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon intensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.","Liu, Zhu; Zhu, Biqing; Ciais, Philippe; Davis, Steven J.; Lu, Chenxi; Zhong, Haiwang; Ke, Piyu; Cui, Yanan; Deng, Zhu; Cui, Duo; Sun, Taochun; Dou, Xinyu; Tan, Jianguang; Guo, Rui; Zheng, Bo; Tanaka, Katsumasa; Zhao, Wenli; Gentine, Pierre",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03240v1.pdf,400

To facilitate women who are experiencing difficulties in terminating their pregnancies in Italy, the Ministry of Health has adapted to the regulations in force in most European countries and issued new guidelines that allow medical abortion up to 63 days, i.e., 9 weeks of gestational age, without mandatory hospitalization. This decision was met with some controversy, based on the assumption that the abortion pill could ""incentivize"" women to resort to abortion more easily. In fact, statistical data show that in countries that have been using medical abortion for some time, the number of abortions has not increased. The authors expect that even in Italy, as is the case in other European countries, the use of telemedicine is likely to gradually increase as a safe and valuable option in the third phase of the health emergency. The authors argue that there is a need to favor pharmacological abortion by setting up adequately equipped counseling centers, as is the case in other European countries, limiting hospitalization to only a few particularly complex cases.","Montanari Vergallo, Gianluca; Rinaldi, Raffaella; Piersanti, Valeria; Tini, Anastasio; Del Rio, Alessandro",Medicina (Kaunas),,400

499156,Hypermetabolism and Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Researchers expect a high quality of biospecimens/data and value-added services from biobanks. Therefore, the concept of ""biobank 3.0"" was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of income and revenue models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a ""physically"" vertical integration driven by the TWB and a ""virtually"" horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users. To these ends, the authors highlight key issues that include, but are not limited to, the harmonization of relevant ELSI standards for various biobanks' integrations; the value-added services and the efficiency of Big Data Era related research and/or precision medicine development, and financial concerns related to biobank sustainability. This paper concludes by discussing how greater participant engagement and the uptake of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can be used in partnership with vertical and horizontal integration as part of a four-pronged approach to promote biobank sustainability, and facilitate the TWB 3.0 transformation.","Lin, Jui-Chu; Hsiao, Wesley Wei-Wen; Fan, Chien-Te",J Transl Med,,400

One potential means to provide care while avoiding unnecessary person-to-person contact is to offer remote services (telemedicine). This study aimed to (1) gather real-time information on the use and perception of telemedicine in people living with type 1 diabetes and (2) assess the challenges, such as restricted access to health care and/or medical supplies. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was widely distributed between 24 March and 5 May 2020 using an open-access web-based platform. Data were analysed descriptively, and results were stratified according to age, sex and HbA 1c. Results: There were 7477 survey responses from individuals in 89 countries. Globally, 30% reported that the pandemic had affected their healthcare access due to cancelled physical appointments with their healthcare providers. Thirty-two per cent reported no fundamental change in their medical follow-up during this period, with 9% stating that no personal contact was established with their doctors over the duration of the study. Twenty-eight per cent received remote care through telephone (72%) or video-calls (28%). Of these, 86% found remote appointments useful and 75% plan to have remote appointments in the future. Glucose control, indicated by HbA 1c, was positively associated with positive perception of telemedicine. In males, 45% of respondents with an HbA 1c &gt; 9% rated telemedicine not useful compared to those with lower HbA 1c,while 20% of females with an HbA 1c &gt; 9% rated it not useful (χ 2 = 14.2, P =.0016). Conclusion: Remote appointments have largely been perceived as positive in people with type 1 diabetes with the majority (75%) stating that they would consider remote appointments beyond the pandemic. Age and level of education do not appear to influence perception of telemedicine, whereas poor glucose control, particularly in males, seems to negatively affect perception.","Scott, Sam N.; Fontana, Federico Y.; Züger, Thomas; Laimer, Markus; Stettler, Christoph",Endocrinol.

499673,Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on an academic vascular practice and a multidisciplinary limb preservation program,2020,"BackgroundThe emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.6.17.2 (Delta) quickly displaced the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and is associated with increases in COVID-19 cases nationally. The Delta variant has been associated with greater transmissibility and higher viral RNA loads in both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals. Data is lacking regarding the infectious virus load in Delta infected individuals and how that compares to individuals infected with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. MethodsWhole genome sequencing of 2,785 clinical isolates was used to characterize the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the National Capital Region between January and July 2021. Clinical chart reviews were performed for the Delta, Alpha, and B.1.2 (a control predominant lineage prior to both VOCs) variants to evaluate disease severity and outcome and Cycle threshold values (Cts) were compared. The presence of infectious virus was determined using Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined from upper respiratory specimen. An analysis of infection in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations was performed. ResultsThe Delta variant displaced the Alpha variant to constitute 88.2% of the circulating lineages in the National Capital Region by July, 2021. The Delta variant associated with increased breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals that were mostly symptomatic when compared to the Alpha breakthrough infections, though it is important to note there was a significantly longer period of time between vaccination and infection with Delta infections. The recovery of infectious virus on cell culture was significantly higher with the Delta variant compared to Alpha in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The impact of vaccination on reducing the recovery of infectious virus from clinical samples was only observed with Alpha variant infections but was strongly associated with low localized SARS-CoV-2 IgG for both variants. A comparison of Ct values showed a significant decrease in the Delta compared to Alpha with no significant differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. ConclusionsOur data indicate that the Delta variant is associated with increased infectious virus loads when compared to the Alpha variant and decreased upper respiratory antiviral IgG levels. Measures to reduce transmission in addition to increasing vaccinations rates have to be implemented to reduce Delta variant spread.

501253,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in neurology and neurosurgery: A scoping review of the early literature,2020,"The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells requires the activation of its surface spike protein, S, by host proteases. The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro. This blockade may be achieved in vivo through 'repurposing' drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics in vitro. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels. Validating our predictions, available in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry displayed this synergy. Further, analysing the data using our model, we estimated the relative usage of the two pathways and found it to vary widely across cell lines, suggesting that targeting both pathways in vivo may be important and synergistic given the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and may help improve the deployability of drug combinations targeting host proteases required for the entry.","Padmanabhan, Pranesh; Desikan, Rajat; Dixit, Narendra M",PLoS Comput Biol,,400

502510,Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has dominated headlines around the world and researchers have generated thousands of scientific articles about the disease. The fast speed of publication has challenged researchers and other stakeholders to keep up with the volume of published articles. To search the literature effectively, researchers use databases such as PubMed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of different searches for COVID-19 records in PubMed and to assess the complexity of searches required. METHODS: We tested PubMed searches for COVID-19 to identify which search string performed best according to standard metrics (sensitivity, precision, and F-score). We evaluated the performance of 8 different searches in PubMed during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how complex a search string is needed. We also tested omitting hyphens and space characters as well as applying quotation marks. RESULTS: The two most comprehensive search strings combining several free-text and indexed search terms performed best in terms of sensitivity (98.4%/98.7%) and F-score (96.5%/95.7%), but the single-term search COVID-19 performed best in terms of precision (95.3%) and well in terms of sensitivity (94.4%) and F-score (94.8%). The term Wuhan virus performed the worst: 7.7% for sensitivity, 78.1% for precision, and 14.0% for F-score. We found that deleting a hyphen or space character could omit a substantial number of records, especially when searching with SARS-CoV-2 as a single term. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive search strings combining free-text and indexed search terms performed better than single-term searches in PubMed, but not by a large margin compared to the single term COVID-19. For everyday searches, certain single-term searches that are entered correctly are probably sufficient, whereas more comprehensive searches should be used for systematic reviews. Still, we suggest additional measures that the US National Library of Medicine could take to support all PubMed users in searching the COVID-19 literature.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Palayew, Adam; Rasmussen, Lauge Neimann; Andersen, Tue Helms; Nicholson, Joey; Norgaard, Ole",J Med Internet Res,,400

This study aimed to compare CO-RADS and RSNA classification with respect to their sensitivity and reliability for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.ResultsA retrospective study assessed consecutive CT chest imaging of 359 COVID-19-positive patients. Three experienced radiologists who were aware of the final diagnosis of all patients, independently categorized each patient according to CO-RADS and RSNA classification. RT-PCR test performed within one week of chest CT scan was used as a reference standard for calculating sensitivity of each system. Kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficient were used to assess reliability of each system. The study group included 359 patients (180 men, 179 women;mean age, 45 ± 16.9 years). Considering combination of CO-RADS 3, 4 and 5 and combination of typical and indeterminate RSNA categories as positive predictors for COVID-19 diagnosis, the overall sensitivity was the same for both classification systems (72.7%). Applying both systems in moderate and severe/critically ill patients resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity (94.7% and 97.8%, respectively). The overall inter-reviewer agreement was excellent for CO-RADS (κ = 0.801), and good for RSNA classification (κ = 0.781).ConclusionCO-RADS and RSNA chest CT classification systems are comparable in diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with similar sensitivity and reliability.","Abdel-Tawab, Mohamed Basha Mohammad Abd Alkhalik Mohamed Ibrahim A.

508115,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on an Emergency Department Service: Experience at the Largest Tertiary Center in Taiwan,2021,"Every year the UK government spends billions of pounds purchasing goods, works and services that are vital to growth, development, health and social welfare. Performed well, public procurement helps a government to nurture competition, save money, and provide better public services. These benefits will not be reaped, however, if the system is not protected adequately from distortion by corruption and/or supplier collusion. This paper concludes that additional measures are required to protect the integrity of procurement processes in England & Wales through improving the distinct public procurement, anti‐corruption and competition regimes and uniting them around a cohesive strategy. It advocates policy coordination and enhancements designed to yield major benefits to public procurement as the UK seeks to develop its own policies post‐Brexit and to grapple with the demands that the Covid‐19 pandemic has placed on public purchasing and the public purse.","Jones, Alison",The Modern Law Review,,400

AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare perceived stress, resilience, depression symptoms and coping strategies on the members of University of Campinas, in Brazil, before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19. METHODS: Volunteers over 18 years of both sexes, members of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in Brazil answered instruments related to perceived stress, depression, resilience and coping strategies during final exams at the end of semester during 2018 to 2020. RESULTS: We obtained 1,135 responses (893 before COVID-19 and 242 during COVID-19). The volunteers did not show significant differences for perceived stress, depressive signs and resilience before and during the pandemic. In both periods, men exhibited lower scores for perceived stress and depression and higher scores for resilience when compared to women. Undergraduate and graduate students exhibited higher perceived stress scores, more pronounced depressive signs and lower resilience, and employees and professors presented lower scores for perceived stress, depressive signs and greater resilience. CONCLUSIONS: These first months of confinement did not directly affect the scores of perceived stress, depression and resilience, however, each subgroup adapted to the new routine by changing the coping strategy used. This study suggests the importance of monitoring the mental health of member in the university, especially in times of epidemic, in the search for policies that aim to improve the resilience of the population and seek positive and effective coping strategies within the university environment.","Amaral-Prado, Heloísa Monteiro; Borghi, Filipy; Mello, Tânia Maron Vichi Freire; Grassi-Kassisse, Dora Maria",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,400

This report investigates the relationship of significant COVID-19 infection and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as reflected in the patient clinical and laboratory characteristics. METHODS: We reviewed the demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and radiologic evaluations, results of venous duplex imaging and mortality of COVID-19-positive patients (18-89 years) admitted to the Indiana University Academic Health Center. Using oxygen saturation, radiologic findings, and need for advanced respiratory therapies, patients were classified into mild, moderate, or severe categories of COVID-19 infection. A descriptive analysis was performed using univariate and bivariate Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to examine the distribution of patient characteristics and compare the DVT outcomes. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of experiencing DVT and a receiver operating curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff for d-dimer to predict DVT in this COVID-19 cohort. Time to the diagnosis of DVT from admission was analyzed using log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier plots. RESULTS: Our study included 71 unique COVID-19-positive patients (mean age, 61 years) categorized as having 3% mild, 14% moderate, and 83% severe infection and evaluated with 107 venous duplex studies. DVT was identified in 47.8% of patients (37% of examinations) at an average of 5.9 days after admission. Patients with DVT were predominantly male (67%; P = .032) with proximal venous involvement (29% upper and 39% in the lower extremities with 55% of the latter demonstrating bilateral involvement). Patients with DVT had a significantly higher mean d-dimer of 5447 ± 7032 ng/mL (P = .0101), and alkaline phosphatase of 110 IU/L (P = .0095) than those without DVT. On multivariable analysis, elevated d-dimer (P = .038) and alkaline phosphatase (P = .021) were associated with risk for DVT, whereas age, sex, elevated C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were not. A receiver operating curve analysis suggests an optimal d-dimer value of 2450 ng/mL cutoff with 70% sensitivity, 59.5% specificity, and 61% positive predictive value, and 68.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that males with severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization are at highest risk for developing DVT. Elevated d-dimers and alkaline phosphatase along with our multivariable model can alert the clinician to the increased risk of DVT requiring early evaluation and aggressive treatment.","Motaganahalli, Raghu L; Kapoor, Rajat; Timsina, Lava R; Gutwein, Ashley R; Ingram, Michael D; Raman, Subha; Roberts, Scott D; Rahman, Omar; Rollins, David; Dalsing, Michael C",J.

518909,Using the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio to estimate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that the disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased psychological distress and time spent on digital technology among young people, thus intensifying pre-pandemic concerns regarding the putative effects of digital technology use on mental health. To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5 ± 5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone ""Screen Time"" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.","Sewall, Craig J R; Goldstein, Tina R; Rosen, Daniel",J Affect Disord,,400
518998,Teaching Sexual History Taking in Health Care Using Online Technology: A PLISSIT-Plus Zoom Approach During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Shutdown,2020,"s-Block metal carbenoids are carbene synthons and applied in a myriad of organic transformations. They exhibit a strong structure-activity relation-ship, but this is only poorly understood due to the challenging high reactivity and sensitivity of these reagents. Here, we report on systematic VT and DOSY NMR studies, XRD analyses as well as DFT calculations on a sulfoximinoyl-substituted model system to explain the pronounced solvent dependency of the carbenoid stability. While the sodium and potassium chloride car-benoids showed high stabilities independent of the solvent, the lithium carbenoid was stable at room temperature in THF but decomposed at -10 °C in toluene. These divergent stabilities could be explained by the different structures formed in solution. In contrast to simple organolithium reagents, the monomeric THF-solvate was found to be more stable than the dimer in toluene, since the latter more readily forms direct Li/Cl interactions which facilitate decomposition via &#945;-elimination.","Dilchert, Katharina; Schmidt, Michelle; Großjohann, Angela; Feichtner, Kai-Stephan; Mulvey, Robert E; Gessner, Viktoria H",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,400

An online survey, distributed world-wide in April/May 2020, investigated how singing voice pedagogues were impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The collected responses from 387 survey participants suggest that, overall, voice teachers were only moderately satisfied with having to teach virtually, indicating that virtual voice teaching is not a sufficient replacement for in-person teaching. The participants indicated that during virtual teaching the singing voice can be assessed relatively well through features which provide both acoustic and visual clues. In contrast, depending on utilized technology, it may be harder to judge those aspects of the singing voice that are solely defined acoustically, such as dynamic range and spectral composition. This may be explained by limitations imposed by ""out of the box"" technology for online communication, which is typically optimized for speech instead of singing. This calls for better information on technological solutions for virtual voice teaching.","Murdaugh, Kristen; Hausknecht, Josipa Bainac; Herbst, Christian T",J. voice,,400

Here we review the historical origins and the current state of the science of innate and adaptive immunity in aging and longevity. From the modern point of view, innate and adaptive immunity are not only affected by aging but also are important parts of its underlying mechanisms. Excessive levels or activity of antimicrobial peptides, C-reactive protein, complement system, TLR/NF-κB, cGAS/STING/IFN 1,3 and AGEs/RAGE pathways, myeloid cells and NLRP3 inflammasome, declined levels of NK cells in innate immunity, thymus involution and decreased amount of naive T-cells in adaptive immunity, are biomarkers of aging and predisposition factors for cellular senescence and aging-related pathologies. Long-living species, human centenarians, and women are characterized by less inflamm-aging and decelerated immunosenescence. Despite recent progress in understanding, the harmonious theory of immunosenescence is still developing.

Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called “cytokine storm” and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients.

The research was conducted on a fractional technical scale using real municipal treated wastewater from two large wastewater treatment plants treating most of the wastewater over the one-million polycentric Gdańsk agglomeration (1.2 million inhabitants). UF 200 kDa and UF 400 kDa processes enabled further improvement of the physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater. Total phosphorus (to below 0.2 mg/L–UF 200 kDa, 0.13 mg/L–UF 400 kDa) and turbid substances (to below 0.2 mg/L, both membranes) were removed in the highest degree. COD was reduced efficiently (to below 25.6 mgO(2)/L–UF 200 kDa, 26.8 mgO(2)/L–UF 400 kDa), while total nitrogen was removed to a small extent (to 7.12 mg/L–UF 200 kDa and 5.7 mg/L–UF 400 kDa. Based on the reduction of indicator bacteria; fecal coliforms including E. coli (FC) and fecal enterococci (FE) it was found that the ultrafiltration is an effective method of disinfection. Not much indicator bacterial were observed in the permeate after processes (UF 200 kDa; FC—5 CFU/L; FE—1 CFU/L and UF 400 kDa; FC—70 CFU/L; FE—10 CFU/L.

None considered the significant impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load on adverse outcomes. We aimed to clarify the prognostic role of NTIS among predominantly mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective study of COVID‐19 patients. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Consecutive adults admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID‐19 from July to December 2020 were prospectively recruited. SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load was represented by cycle threshold (Ct) values from real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory specimen on admission. Serum TSH, free thyroxine and free T3 were measured on admission. The outcome was deterioration in clinical severity, defined as worsening in ≥1 category of clinical severity according to the Chinese National Health Commission guideline. RESULTS: We recruited 367 patients. At baseline, 75.2% had mild disease, and 27 patients (7.4%) had NTIS. Fifty‐three patients (14.4%) had clinical deterioration. Patients with NTIS were older, had more comorbidities, worse symptomatology, higher SARS‐CoV‐2 viral loads and worse profiles of inflammatory and tissue injury markers. They were more likely to have clinical deterioration (p < .001). In multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis, NTIS independently predicted clinical deterioration (adjusted odds ratio 3.19, p = .017), in addition to Ct value <25 (p < .001), elevated C‐reactive protein (p = .004), age >50 years (p = .011) and elevated creatine kinase (p = .017).

Community-tailored dashboards are central to the CTH intervention’s mandate to implement a community-engaged and data-driven process. These dashboards support a participating community’s decision-making for selection and monitoring of evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. METHODS/DESIGN: A community-tailored dashboard is a web-based set of interactive data visualizations of community-specific metrics. Metrics include opioid overdose deaths and other OUD-related measures, as well as drivers of change of these outcomes in a community. Each community-tailored dashboard is a product of a co-creation process between HCS researchers and stakeholders from each community. The four research sites usea varied set of technical approaches and solutions to support the scientific design and CTH intervention implementation. Ongoing evaluation of the dashboards involves quantitative and qualitative data on key aspects posited to shape dashboard use combined with website analytics. DISCUSSION: The HCS presents an opportunity to advance how community-tailored dashboards can foster community-driven solutions to address the opioid epidemic. Lessons learned can be applied to inform interventions for public health concerns and issues that have disproportionate impact across communities and populations (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities and other marginalized individuals).

598282,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children: a systematic review of imaging findings,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: We considered the extent of the contribution of publicly funded research to the late-stage clinical development of pharmaceuticals and medicinal products, based on the European Commission (EC) FP7 research funding programme. Using two EC FP7-HEALTH case study examples—representing two types of outcomes—we then estimated wider public and charitable research funding contributions. METHODS: Using the publicly available database of FP7-HEALTH funded projects, we identified awards relating to late-stage clinical development according to the systematic application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, classified them according to product type and clinical indication, and calculated total EC funding amounts. We then identified two case studies representing extreme outcomes: failure to proceed with the product (hepatitis C vaccine) and successful market authorisation (Orfadin® for alkaptonuria). Total public and philanthropic research funding contributions to these products were then estimated using publicly available information on funding. RESULTS: 12.3% (120/977) of all EC FP7-HEALTH awards related to the funding of late-stage clinical research, totalling € 686,871,399. Pharmaceutical products and vaccines together accounted for 84% of these late-stage clinical development research awards and 70% of its funding. The hepatitis C vaccine received total European Community (FP7 and its predecessor, EC Framework VI) funding of €13,183,813; total public and charitable research funding for this product development was estimated at € 77,060,102. The industry sponsor does not consider further development of this product viable; this now represents public risk investment. FP7 funding for the late-stage development of Orfadin® for alkaptonuria was so important that the trials it funded formed the basis for market authorisation, but it is not clear whether the price of the treatment (over €20,000 per patient per year) adequately reflects the substantial public funding contribution. CONCLUSIONS: Public and charitable research funding plays an essential role, not just in early stage basic research, but also in the late-stage clinical development of products prior to market authorisation. In addition, it provides risk capital for failed products. Within this context, we consider further discussions about a public return on investment and its reflection in pricing policies and decisions justified.","Schmidt, L.; Sehic, O.; Wild, C.",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910624/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-021-00317-8,400
598627,Recommendations for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in COVID-19 patients: Consensus paper of the Medical University of Vienna,2020-07-03,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of our study were to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on primary care in Germany regarding the number of consultations, the prevalence of specific reasons for consultation presented by the patients, and the frequency of specific services performed by the GP. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study based on standardised GP interviews in a quota sampling design comparing the time before the COVID-19 pandemic (12 June 2015 to 27 April 2017) with the time during lockdown (21 April to 14 July 2020). The sample included GPs in urban and rural areas 120 km around Hamburg, Germany, and was stratified by region type and administrative districts. Differences in the consultation numbers were analysed by multivariate linear regressions in mixed models adjusted for random effects on the levels of the administrative districts and GP practices. RESULTS: One hundred ten GPs participated in the follow-up, corresponding to 52.1% of the baseline. Primary care practices in 32 of the 37 selected administrative districts (86.5%) could be represented in both assessments. At baseline, GPs reported 199.6 ± 96.9 consultations per week, which was significantly reduced during COVID-19 lockdown by 49.0% to 101.8 ± 67.6 consultations per week (p < 0.001). During lockdown, the frequency of five reasons for consultation (-43.0% to -31.5%) and eleven services (-56.6% to -33.5%) had significantly decreased. The multilevel, multivariable analyses showed an average reduction of 94.6 consultations per week (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a dramatic reduction of the number of consultations in primary care. This effect was independent of age, sex and specialty of the GP and independent of the practice location in urban or rural areas. Consultations for complaints like low back pain, gastrointestinal complaints, vertigo or fatigue and services like house calls/calls at nursing homes, wound treatments, pain therapy or screening examinations for the early detection of chronic diseases were particularly affected.","Schäfer, Ingmar; Hansen, Heike; Menzel, Agata; Eisele, Marion; Tajdar, Daniel; Lühmann, Dagmar; Scherer, Martin",BMC Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162343/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01471-3,400

This is to understand the socio-cultural, economic and technological processes that triggered it and to attempt to imagine future scenarios. At the dawn of the third millennium, it seems as if the juggernaut of modernity, with its dream of unlimited progress and cargo of unconditional trust in instrumental rationality, has abruptly slowed down. The pandemic challenges contemporary society to develop a different weltanschauung, alternative to the performative and conformist idea of social planification supported by the neoliberal paradigm. It compels us to finally acquire the consciousness that the complexity of knowledge and global interdependency require collective awareness, political participation, and shared responsibility.","Lusardi, Roberto; Tomelleri, Stefano",Front Sociol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2020.611885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869527/,400

Research on mitochondria—156 brand new publications from 2019 and 2020—have contributed to this review. Mitochondria have been fundamental for the evolution of complex organisms. As important and semi-autonomous organelles in cells, they can adapt their function to the needs of the respective organ. They can program their function to energy supply (e.g., to keep heart muscle cells going, life-long) or to metabolism (e.g., to support hepatocytes and liver function). The capacity of mitochondria to re-program between different options is important for all cell types that are capable of changing between a resting state and cell proliferation, such as stem cells and immune cells. Major chronic diseases are characterized by mitochondrial dysregulation. This will be exemplified by cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, immune system disorders, and cancer. New strategies for intervention in chronic diseases will be presented. The tumor microenvironment can be considered a battlefield between cancer and immune defense, competing for energy supply and metabolism. Cancer cachexia is considered as a final stage of cancer progression. Nevertheless, the review will present an example of complete remission of cachexia via immune cell transfer. These findings should encourage studies along the lines of mitochondria, energy supply, and metabolism.","Schirrmacher, Volker",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266387/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8110526,400

This study aimed to assess general public knowledge in Jordan and awareness of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was carried out utilizing the WHO multicountry public awareness survey. The study population was composed mainly of social media users, and a total of 1213 participants completed the online survey. According to the findings, more than half of the participants were well versed in antibiotic use and resistance. Those with adequate health literacy were found to better understand antibiotics (OR = 1.37, p = 0.017) and antibiotic resistance (OR = 1.46, p = 0.003). The vast majority (88.5%) recognized at least one antibiotic resistance term; however, 53.2% believed that antibiotic resistance is a problem in other nations. The participants in this study reported using antibiotics incorrectly, believing that they were treating sore throats, colds, and flu. The participants were well aware of antibiotic resistance solutions and their consequences on health. Age, education, health literacy, and antibiotic knowledge were found to be substantially (p < 0.05) associated with greater awareness of antibiotic resistance.

METHODS Retrospective chart review. RESULTS A 26-year-old woman presented with paracentral scotomas in both eyes that acutely developed two days following administration of a single dose adenovector SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ). She had previously received the seasonal influenza immunization without any symptoms and denied any recent history of viral illnesses. On examination, optical coherence tomography showed parafoveal hyperreflective bands in the outer retina of both eyes without retinal thickening, and near-infrared reflectance showed wedge-shaped parafoveal lesions pointing to the fovea, both classic findings in acute macular neuroretinopathy. DISCUSSION This report highlights the development of AMN after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in an otherwise healthy female patient. A single case cannot establish cause and effect, and millions of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered safely at the time of writing.

We investigated levels of copeptin, the C-terminal segment of the vasopressin prohormone, that mirrors the production rate of vasopressin in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We measured levels of copeptin on admission and after 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8 days in 74 consecutive hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n=876) and acute or chronic bronchitis (n=371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Median admission copeptin levels in COVID-19 patients were almost 4-fold higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (49.4 pmol/L (IQR 24.9-68.9 pmol/L) vs. 13.5 pmol/L (IQR 7.0-26.7 pmol/L) resulting in an age and gender-adjusted odds ratio of 7.0 (95%CI 1.2 to 40.3), p<0.03 for mortality. Higher copeptin levels in non-survivors persisted during the short-term follow-up. Compared to the control group patients with acute/chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, COVID-19 patients did not have higher admission copeptin levels. CONCLUSIONS: A pronounced activation of the vasopressin system in COVID-19 patients is associated with an adverse clinical course in COVID-19 patients. This finding, however, is not unique to COVID-19 but similar to other types of respiratory infections. .","Gregoriano, Claudia; Molitor, Alexandra; Haag, Ellen; Kutz, Alexander; Koch, Daniel; Haubitz, Sebastian; Conen, Anna; Bernasconi, Luca; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Fux, Christoph A; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056499/; https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvab045,400

Timely and accurate detection is necessary for spread control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, avoiding inaccurate outcomes. Therefore, in this systematic review, it is purpose to evaluate a set of laboratory diagnostic techniques and methods, analyse their specificity, sensitivity, contributing to improve detection rates and reduce false negative and false positive diagnostic results. METHODS: In this review, we used literature available on the indexed search database ‘PubMed’, concerning the following keywords: ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘Specimen handling’, ‘Cell Culture Technique’, ‘Viral Antigen’, ‘Immunoassay’, ‘NAAT’ according to Medical Subject Headings Mesh and applying the Prisma Diagram methodology. RESULTS: DD-PCR and CRISPER had more promising results, but they are unconventional and expensive NAAT methods, the usage of the target RdRp/He gene has exhibited very encouraging results improving sensitivity and specificity. After the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of the immunoassay varies considering of blood collection day. The antigen detection test showed the highest specificity reached, however is sensitivity is lower compared to NAAT assays. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, RT-PCR still considered the gold standard and precisely detects the presence of virus RNA, although with some flaws in sensitivity, while the serological tests identify a previous infection by the virus, detecting antibodies, allowing the kinetic and immunological studies, not being able to use as a diagnostic method.

About 30–50% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin; of these, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are associated with the greatest disease burden in humans. Vaccination against circulating human influenza strains and the use of neuraminidase inhibitor drugs have improved the options for control of influenza, but as yet there are no successful vaccines or antiviral drugs for use against RSV infection. The recent emergence of the SARS coronavirus in the human population in 2003, with an ensuing global epidemic affecting more than 8000 individuals with a case fatality of about 10%, underlines the fact that respiratory viral infections of humans may originate in animals, and that many different influenza A viruses also occur naturally in animal reservoirs, representing a constant threat of zoonotic infections of humans and ensuing global pandemics. Avian influenza viruses have transmitted directly to humans from domestic poultry on several occasions in the last decade, and the current extensive burden of disease from avian influenza in South East Asia provides a real possibility for the emergence of a novel influenza virus pathogenic in humans.","Zambon, Maria",Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308534/; https://doi.org/10.1383/medc.33.5.130.64960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303906002015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906002015,400

It is urgent to analyze the real situation and follow-up trend of the epidemic in the United States. The proposed model divides the time period into two different phases, before and after March 21, 2020. The results show that the basic reproduction number in the early period of propagation in the United States is estimated to be 4.06 (95% CI: 1.86-6.73) based on the confirmed cases data ranging from January 21, 2020 to March 21, 2020. The normalized contributions to R_0 for three different categories of communicators were estimated, including the numbers of the latent population (in incubation period) L, the documented infectious population Id, and the undocumented infectious population Iu. The results show that L contributes 16.17% (95% CI: 12.86% - 21.60%) to R_0, Id contributes 55.13% (95% CI: 43.15% - 63.97%), and Iu contributes 28.70% (95% CI: 19.29% - 40.07%) to R0. The metapopulation network was used to simulate the true spread of COVID-19 in the United States, and the Bayesian inference was applied to estimate the key parameters including the rate of the number of the susceptibles and the infected beta, the infection ratio between undocumented and documented transmission 1, the infection ratio between latent and documented transmission 2, the proportion of confirmed cases in the infectious population x, and the duration of latent period (incubation period) TL . From the analysis of phase one, 1 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.17 - 0.54), 2 was estimated to be 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02 - 0.11), x was estimated to be 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55 - 0.78), T_L was estimated to be 8.41 (95% CI: 6.64 - 9.42). As of April 13, 2020, it was estimated that only 45% (95% CI: 35% - 73%) of symptom onset cases in the United States have been documnented. The infectivity of undocumented infectious population was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.21 - 0.70) of that of the documented infectious population, while that of the latent population was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11 - 0.27) of that of the documented infectious population. The incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 10.69 days (95% CI: 10.02 - 11.74). We estimated that if the current control interventions are continued, the pandemic situation in the United States is likely to keep climbing up, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases is expected to reach more than 1.7 million in July and continue to grow. We also performed component analysis and sensitivity analysis, researching the compositions of the people with COVID-19, and considering that there is only a random time delay between the number of patients in the incubation period and the actual number of patients.","Liu, Q.; Zhu, J.; Liu, Z.; Zhu, Y.; Zhou, L.; Gao, Z.; Li, D.; Tang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Yang, J.; Wang, Q.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094086v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094086,400

We conduct the first comparative host–pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P≤0.001; m(2) global value = 7.3320, P≤0.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P≤0.001; m(2) global value = 86.532, P≤0.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m(2) global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs, and ultimately to humans.","Lei, Bonnie R.; Olival, Kevin J.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651646/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002738,400

Individual outer membrane proteins from intracellular and extracellular virions of vaccinia virus, when delivered in the form of either DNA vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells, were able to protect mice from the vaccinia virus challenge and rhesus macaques from the monkeypox virus challenge. The polyvalent formulations with various combinations of the four poxvirus antigens (A27, L1, B5 and A33) achieved better protection than the monovalent formulation using only one of these antigens. However, it is not clear whether any of the remaining outer membrane poxvirus proteins can further improve the efficacy of the current polyvalent formulations. In this study, we conducted detailed analysis on the immunogenicity of D8, a previously reported protective antigen from intracellular mature virions. Our results indicated that D8 induced strong protective antibody responses and was effective in improving the efficacy of previously reported polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations.

Methods: Publicly available data from The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic was accessed between 09/09/2020 and 09/14/2020. For each state and the District of Columbia, % infection, % death, % population proportion for subgroups of race (African American (AA), Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, (AI/AN) and White), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic), were recorded. Absolute and relative excess infection (AEI and REI) and mortality (AEM and REM) were computed as absolute and relative difference between % infection or % mortality and % population proportion for each state. Median (IQR) REI is provided below. Results: The Hispanic population had a median of 158% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median REI 158%, [IQR: 100% to 200%]). This was followed by AA, with 50% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median REI, 50% [IQR 25% to 100%]). The AA population had the most disproportionate mortality with a median of 46% higher mortality than % population proportion, (median REM 46% [IQR, 18% to 66%]).

Use of face-to-face-semi structured interviews with supply side providers in Thailand results in recognizing safety measures to ask tourists about, other than those found in the literature. Researchers collected questionnaire data from international leisure and business tourists to Thailand on importance of safety and security measures. Analysis of the importance of 23 safety and security measures show a six factor pattern in thinking about measures. However, the most important measure is not in a factor. Therefore, the study considers analysis method issues and raises questions about the value of structured data and merits of the recognition of if-then conditions by research methods such as long interviews. Examination of practical, theoretical and methodological values of findings includes considering research needed and the utility of safety measure information in business decision making.","Rittichainuwat, Bongkosh N.; Chakraborty, Goutam",J Bus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296311002499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287524/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296311002499; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.013,400

615183,Disease Severity and Perinatal Outcomes of Pregnant Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021-02-08,"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in a devastating inflammatory response resulting in thromboembolic events. Upwards of 40% of patients have been reported to have venous thromboembolism while the incidence of arterial thrombotic events, including acute limb ischemia (ALI), is estimated to be lower at 5%. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of ALI in COVID-19 to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man with hypertension and pre-diabetes presented to our facility with tachypnea and hypoxia with oxygen saturation of 80%. He was placed on high flow nasal cannula but required intubation due to respiratory failure. Initial laboratory values revealed D-dimer 460 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 109 mg/L, ferritin 3,282 ng/mL, and creatine kinase 700 U/L. Right soleal vein thrombosis was identified on lower extremity ultrasound and he was started on intravenous heparin with therapeutic levels. On hospital day 4, he became acutely hypotensive and hyperkalemic to 7.9 mmol/L. Physical exam was notable for cold lower extremities with mottling while laboratory values showed lactate 4.1 mmol/L, D-dimer greater than 10,000 ng/mL, ferritin 23,712 ng/mL, and creatine kinase 21,078 U/L. Upon evaluation with lower extremity arterial duplex, there was no Doppler signal detected in the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and anterior tibial arteries. A subsequent CT angiogram revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, acute total occlusion of the aorta beginning distal to the renal arteries, and extensive lower limb muscle stranding suggestive of ischemic injury. He was taken to the operating room and underwent emergent thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Unfortunately, he suffered severe reperfusion injury and expired shortly after the procedure. DISCUSSION: ALI presents with the 6 Ps: pain, pallor, paralysis, paresthesia, poikilothermia, and pulselessness. In COVID-19, it is estimated that 71% of arterial thrombotic events involve the lower extremities. Patients at risk are noted to be males over the age of 60 with diabetes and hypertension. Diagnosis can be made with duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography. After initiating therapeutic anticoagulation, vascular surgery should be consulted for management options such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or open surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the significance of arterial thrombotic events in COVID-19 and the importance of early recognition of ALI. Unexplained hyperkalemia should be thoroughly investigated as it can be a presentation of myonecrosis secondary to ALI. Prompt initiation of anticoagulation and vascular surgery consult are vital in limiting morbidity and mortality. REFERENCE #1: Helms J, Tacquard C, Severac F, et al.

617631,Cardiac Surgery During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Perioperative Considerations and Triage Recommendations,2020-06-18,"Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID‐19, are thought to spread faster during winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions are more conducive to the transmission of VRDs than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing COVID‐19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID‐19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that air drying capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state variable that controls the fate/evolution of the virus‐laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID‐19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID‐19 and prevalent across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID‐19. However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID‐19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons.","Choi, Yeon‐Woo; Tuel, Alexandre; Eltahir, Elfatih A.

METHODS: From March 14 to April 6, 2020, 72 non-hospitalized patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical and laboratory data and CT scan findings were collected for each patient. CTPA scans were reviewed by two radiologists to determinate the presence or absence of APE. Clinical classification, lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, and CT total severity score were compared between APE group and non-APE group. RESULTS: APE was identified in 13 (18%) CTPA scans. The mean age and D-dimer of patients from the APE group were higher in comparison with those from the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008, and 7.29 vs. 3.29 μg/ml, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between APE and non-APE groups concerning clinical type, COVID-19 pneumonia lung lesions (ground-glass opacity: 85% vs. 97%; consolidation: 69% vs. 68%; crazy paving: 38% vs. 37%; linear reticulation: 69% vs. 78%), CT severity score (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365), quality of CTPA (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518), and pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146). CONCLUSIONS: Non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia referred to CT scan by the emergency departments are at risk of APE. The presence of APE was not limited to severe or critical clinical type of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: • Acute pulmonary embolism was found in 18% of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA. Two (15%) patients had main, four (30%) lobar, and seven (55%) segmental acute pulmonary embolism. • Five of 13 (38%) patients with acute pulmonary embolism had a moderate clinical type. • Severity and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia showed no significant difference between patients with or without acute pulmonary embolism.","Gervaise, Alban; Bouzad, Caroline; Peroux, Evelyne; Helissey, Carole",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06977-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518989/,400

We conducted a cross-sectional survey to describe the camel herd profile and determine the factors associated with MERS-CoV seropositivity in Northern Kenya. We enrolled 29 camel-owning households and administered questionnaires to collect herd and household data. Serum samples collected from 493 randomly selected camels were tested for anti-MERS-CoV antibodies using a microneutralisation assay, and regression analysis used to correlate herd and household characteristics with camel seropositivity. Households reared camels (median = 23 camels and IQR 16–56), and at least one other livestock species in two distinct herds; a home herd kept near homesteads, and a range/fora herd that resided far from the homestead. The overall MERS-CoV IgG seropositivity was 76.3%, with no statistically significant difference between home and fora herds. Significant predictors for seropositivity (P ⩽ 0.05) included camels 6–10 years old (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0–5.2), herds with ⩾25 camels (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.4) and camels from Gabra community (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.2).

OBJECTIVE: We have developed and applied an emergency plan, tailored for Outpatients with endocrine diseases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study from March to May 2020. SETTING: Referral University-Hospital center. PATIENTS: 1262 patients in 8 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: The emergency plan is based upon the endocrine triage, the stay-safe procedures and the tele-Endo. During endocrine triage every patient was contacted by phone to assess health status and define if the visit will be performed face-to-face (F2F) or by tele-Medicine (tele-Endo). In case of F2F, targeted stay-safe procedures have been adopted. Tele-Endo, performed by phone and email, is dedicated to COVID-19-infected patients, to elderly or frail people, or to those with a stable disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To assess efficacy of the emergency plan to continue the follow-up of Outpatients. RESULTS: The number of visits cancelled after endocrine triage (9%) is lower than that cancelled independently by the patients (37%, p < 0.001); the latter reduced from 47 to 19% during the weeks of lockdown (p = 0.032). 86% of patients contacted by endocrine-triage received a clinical response (F2F and tele-Endo visits). F2F visit was offered especially to young patients; tele-Endo was applied to 63% of geriatric patients (p < 0.001), visits’ outcome was similar between young and aged patients.

In this study, we found two H9N2 viruses with similar genetic background but with different pathogenicity in mice. The A/duck/Nanjing/06/2003 (NJ06) virus was highly pathogenic for mice, with a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of 10(2.83) 50% egg infectious dose (EID(50)), whereas the A/duck/Nanjing/01/1999 (NJ01) virus was low pathogenic for mice, with a MLD(50) of >10(6.81) EID(50). Further studies showed that the NJ06 virus grew faster and reached significantly higher titers than NJ01 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the NJ06 virus induced more severe lung lesions, and higher levels of inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs than NJ01 did. However, only 12 different amino acid residues (HA-K157E, NA-A9T, NA-R435K, PB2-T149P, PB2-K627E, PB1-R187K, PA-L548M, PA-M550L, NP-G127E, NP-P277H, NP-D340N, NS1-D171N) were found between the two viruses, and all these residues except for NA-R435K were located in the known functional regions involved in interaction of viral proteins or between the virus and host factors. Summary, our results suggest that multiple amino acid differences may be responsible for the higher pathogenicity of the NJ06 virus for mice, resulting in lethal infection, enhanced viral replication, severe lung lesions, and excessive inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs. These observations will be helpful for better understanding the pathogenic potential and the corresponding molecular basis of H9N2 viruses that might pose threats to human health in the future.","Liu, Qingtao; Liu, Yuzhuo; Yang, Jing; Huang, Xinmei; Han, Kaikai; Zhao, Dongmin; Bi, Keran; Li, Yin",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27867373/,400

The multidrug resistance of bacteria has considerably increased the difficulties of scientific research and the concomitant emergence of resistance is to be expected. In this study we have investigated the in vitro activity of 15 ethanol extracts prepared from Moroccan medicinal plants traditionally used for treatment of skin infections. Among the tested species I. viscosa, C. oxyacantha, R. tinctorum, A. herba alba, and B. hispanica showed moderate anti-staphylococcal activity. However, R. alaternus showed promising growth-inhibitory effects against specific pathogenic bacteria especially methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leucocidin positive (MSSA-PVL) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The bioguided fractionation of this plant using successive chromatographic separations followed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) including EIMS and HREIMS analysis yielded the emodin (1) and kaempferol (2). Emodin being the most active with MICs ranging between 15.62 and 1.95 µg/mL and showing higher activity against the tested strains in comparison with the crude extract, its mechanism of action and the structure-activity relationship were interestingly discussed. The active compound has not displayed toxicity toward murine macrophage cells. The results obtained in the current study support the traditional uses of R. alaternus and suggest that this species could be a good source for the development of new anti-staphylococcal agents.","Zeouk, Ikrame; Ouedrhiri, Wessal; Sifaoui, Ines; Bazzocchi, Isabel L.; Piñero, José E.; Jiménez, Ignacio A.; Lorenzo-Morales, Jacob; Bekhti, Khadija",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26144352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299627/,400

Obtaining specific IgY is sustained by reliable and nature friendly methodology as an alternative for mammalian antibodies. The aria of application is continuously enlarging from bacterial and viral infections to tumor biology. Specific anti-viral IgY were previously tested in several designs, thus its worth pointing out that in the actual COVID-19 pandemic context, respiratory infections need an enlarged arsenal of therapeutic approaches and clearly the roles of IgY should be exploited in depth.","Constantin, Carolina; Neagu, Monica; Diana Supeanu, Teodora; Chiurciu, Viorica; A.

The use of Sf9 cells for efficient MrNV replication and propagation was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and PCR amplification, through which early viral binding and internalization were initially detectable at 30 min post-infection; whereas at 72 h, the distinguishable sign of late-MrNV infection was observable as the gradual accumulation of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cells, ultimately resulting in cellular disruption. Moreover, during the early period of infection, the MrNV signals were highly co-localized with CAV1 signals of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway. The use of genistein as an inhibitor of the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway significantly reduced MrNV and CAV1 co-localization, and also reduced the levels of MrNV infection in Sf9 cells as shown by PCR and ELISA. Moreover, the addition of the pathway agonist okadaic acid not only recovered but also augmented both the levels of MrNV co-localization with CAV1 and of Sf9 infection in the presence of genistein inhibition; therefore demonstrating that MrNV infection in Sf9 cells was associated with the CAV-mediated endocytosis pathway machinery.","Somrit, Monsicha; Watthammawut, Atthaboon; Chotwiwatthanakun, Charoonroj; Weerachatyanukul, Wattana",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216302465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27327530/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216302465,400

AIM: To collate a list of relevant symptoms, assessment items, demographics, and lifestyle and health conditions associated with COVID-19, and match these data items with corresponding SNOMED CT clinical terms to support the development and implementation of consultation templates. DESIGN & SETTING: Published and preprint literature for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical guidelines describing the symptoms, assessment items, demographics, and/or lifestyle and health conditions associated with COVID-19 and its complications were reviewed. Corresponding clinical concepts from SNOMED CT, a widely used structured clinical vocabulary for electronic primary care health records, were identified. METHOD: Guidelines and published and unpublished reviews (N = 61) were utilised to collate a list of relevant data items for COVID-19 consultations. The NHS Digital SNOMED CT Browser was used to identify concept and descriptive identifiers. Key implementation challenges were conceptualised through a Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) lens. RESULTS: In total, 32 symptoms, eight demographic and lifestyle features, 25 health conditions, and 20 assessment items relevant to COVID-19 were identified, with proposed corresponding SNOMED CT concepts. These data items can be adapted into a consultation template for COVID-19. Key implementation challenges include: 1) engaging with key stakeholders to achieve ’buy in’; and 2) ensuring any template is usable within practice settings. CONCLUSION: Consultation templates for COVID-19 are needed to standardise data collection, facilitate research and learning, and potentially improve quality of care for COVID-19.","Jani, Bhautesh Dinesh; Pell, Jill P; McGagh, Dylan; Liyanage, Harshana; Kelly, Dave; de Lusignan, Simon; Weatherburn, Christopher J; Burns, Ronnie; Sullivan, Frank M; Mair, Frances S",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20x101125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843331/,400

The aim of this review is to provide a new look at the data already available for COVID-19, exploring it as a transient molecular disease that causes negative regulation of ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and, consequently, deregulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), promoting important changes in the microcirculatory environment. In addition, the authors seek to demonstrate how these microcirculatory changes may be responsible for the wide variety of injury mechanisms observed in different organs in this disease. This new proposed concept of COVID-19 provides a unifying pathophysiological picture of this infection and offers new insights for a rational treatment strategy to combat this new pandemic.","Ramos, Simone Gusmão; da Cruz Rattis, Bruna Amanda; Ottaviani, Giulia; Nunes Celes, Mara Rubia; Dias, Eliane Pedra",Am J Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944021001942?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964216/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944021001942,400

Two groups of viruses were selected: (a) the most important viruses contaminating food, based on numbers of publications in the last 5 years and (b) viruses infecting sources of food that might have an impact on human health. RECENT FINDINGS: Important foodborne viruses such as norovirus, hepatitis A and rotavirus are usually “only” contaminating food and are detected on the surface of foodstuffs. However, they are threats to human public health and make up for the majority of cases. In contrast, the meaning of viruses born from within the food such as natural animal and plant viruses is still in many cases unknown. An exception is Hepatitis E virus that is endemic in pigs, transmitted via pork meat and is recognised as an emerging zoonosis in industrialised countries. SUMMARY: Even though the clinical meaning of “new” foodborne viruses, often detected by next generation sequencing, still needs clarification, the method has great potential to enhance surveillance and detection particularly in view of an increasingly globalised food trade.","Bachofen, Claudia",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226717/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-018-0087-9,400

The prevalence of conjunctivitis in patients with COVID-19 is at present controversial. Although it has been reported that only 0.9% developed signs of conjunctivitis, other report indicates that up to 31.6% of hospitalized patients had conjunctivitis. Considering the widespread use of topical ophthalmic medications (e.g., eye drops) by the general population, for various reasons (e.g., artificial tears, anti-glaucoma medications, topical antibiotics, etc.), the existence of their side effects as antiviral action should be investigated in-depth because it could possibly explain the aforementioned controversial data and represent a potential antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 replication/diffusion on the ocular surface. Here, we discuss and elucidate the antiviral side effect of many eye drops and ophthalmic ointments commonly used for others purposes, thus showing that these secondary effects (not to be confused with the ‘adverse effects’) might be of primary importance in a number of viral infections (e.g., those for which there is no validated treatment protocol), according to a drug repurposing approach.

The focus of this communication is on a potential biomarker, short telomere length (TL), that might serve to identify patients more likely to die from the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, regardless of age. The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells. These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T‐cell proliferation. They suggest that T‐cell lymphopoiesis might stall in individuals with short TL who are infected with SARS‐CoV‐2.","Aviv, Abraham",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427393/,400

Currently, there is no RSV vaccine or universally accessible antiviral treatment available. Addressing the urgent need for new antiviral agents, we have investigated the capacity of a non-coding single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON) to inhibit RSV infection. By utilizing a GFP-expressing RSV, we demonstrate that the ssON significantly reduced the proportion of RSV infected A549 cells (lung epithelial cells). Furthermore, we show that ssON’s antiviral activity was length dependent and that both RNA and DNA of this class of oligonucleotides have antiviral activity. We reveal that ssON inhibited RSV infection by competing with the virus for binding to the cellular receptor nucleolin in vitro. Additionally, using a recombinant RSV that expresses luciferase we show that ssON effectively blocked RSV infection in mice. Treatment with ssON in vivo resulted in the upregulation of RSV-induced interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) such as Stat1, Stat2, Cxcl10, and Ccl2. This study highlights the possibility of using oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents against RSV infection. We demonstrate that the mechanism of action of ssON is the inhibition of viral entry in vitro, likely through the binding of the receptor, nucleolin and that ssON treatment against RSV infection in vivo additionally results in the upregulation of ISGs.","Pålsson, Sandra Axberg; Dondalska, Aleksandra; Bergenstråhle, Joseph; Rolfes, Caroline; Björk, Albin; Sedano, Laura; Power, Ultan F.; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Lundeberg, Joakim; Wahren-Herlenius, Marie; Mastrangelo, Peter; Eleouet, Jean-Francois; Le Goffic, Ronan; Galloux, Marie; Spetz, Anna-Lena",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.580547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363532/,400

To address the relevance of small non-coding RNAs in SARS-CoV pathology, we deep sequenced RNAs from the lungs of infected mice and discovered three 18–22 nt small viral RNAs (svRNAs). The three svRNAs were derived from the nsp3 (svRNA-nsp3.1 and -nsp3.2) and N (svRNA-N) genomic regions of SARS-CoV. Biogenesis of CoV svRNAs was RNase III, cell type, and host species independent, but it was dependent on the extent of viral replication. Antagomir-mediated inhibition of svRNA-N significantly reduced in vivo lung pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, these data indicate that svRNAs contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis and highlight the potential of svRNA-N antagomirs as antivirals.","Morales, Lucía; Oliveros, Juan Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raúl; tenOever, Benjamin Robert; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Cell Host & Microbe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312817300379; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312817300379; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5662013?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.01.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28216251/,400

It is unclear if chemotherapy per se increases the overall risk in this population. In our study, we analyzed retrospective COVID-19 data linked to oncological information systems to evaluate outcomes in COVID-19 cancer patients under chemotherapy. We identified 681 patients with a past history of chemotherapy. Patients in active chemotherapy did not have an increased mortality compared to non-active chemotherapy COVID-19 cases. We identified the use of topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents as protective factors, while palliative intent of treatment and hematological neoplasms were risk factors. ABSTRACT: Background: Cancer patients present a distinct vulnerability to COVID-19. It is unclear if chemotherapy could accentuate the overall risk in these patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis linking COVID-19 data and oncological information systems to compare lethality in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy before COVID-19. We considered patients who received chemotherapy in the last 30 days as in “active treatment”, and patients who did not receive drugs in this period as “non-active treatment” for propensity-score pair matching. We also tested the influence of baseline variables in our results in a multivariate model. Results: 66.1% (162/246) of patients in matched active chemotherapy died vs. 70.2% (172/246) in the matched non-active chemotherapy group. The risk of death was positively associated with palliative intent of treatment and hematologic neoplasms. Being in active chemotherapy was not associated with increased mortality compared to non-active treatment. We also noted in exploratory propensity-score matchings that the use of alkylating agents (odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.70) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14–0.56) were protective factors.

Patients with essential arterial hypertension and renal complications are at particular risk of the fatal course of this infection. In our study, we have modeled the selected processes in a patient with essential hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from COVID-19, emphasizing the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. The model has been built in the language of Petri nets theory. Using the systems approach, we have analyzed how COVID-19 may affect the studied organism, and we have checked whether the administration of selected anti-hypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) may impact the severity of the infection. Besides, we have assessed whether these drugs effectively lower blood pressure in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection affecting essential hypertensive patients. Our research has shown that neither the ACEIs nor the ARBs worsens the course infection. However, when assessing the treatment of hypertension in the active SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have observed that ARBs might not effectively reduce blood pressure; they may even have the slightly opposite effect. On the other hand, we have confirmed the effectiveness of arterial hypertension treatment in patients receiving ACEIs. Moreover, we have found that the simultaneous use of ARBs and ACEIs averages the effects of taking both drugs, thus leading to only a slight decrease in blood pressure. We are a way from suggesting that ARBs in all hypertensive patients with COVID-19 are ineffective, but we have shown that research in this area should still be continued.","Formanowicz, Dorota; Gutowska, Kaja; Szawulak, Bartłomiej; Formanowicz, Piotr",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638859/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910518,400
642752,First lung transplantation as a treatment of a patient supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after COVID-19 in Poland,2021,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of cerebrospinal outflow obstruction, mass lesion, or other underlying cause. It is a rare phenomenon in prepubertal children and is most typically found in women of childbearing age. The classic presentation consists of headaches, nausea, vomiting, and visual changes; however, children present more atypically. We report a case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in an otherwise healthy, 4-year-old child with atypical symptoms resembling those of cyclic vomiting syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Caucasian, otherwise healthy, male child presented to our emergency department with episodic intermittent early-morning vomiting occurring once every 1–3 weeks without interepisodic symptoms, starting 10 months prior. With outpatient metabolic, autoimmune, endocrine, allergy, and gastroenterology work-up all unremarkable, he was initially diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Discovery of mild optic nerve sheath distension on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain 10 months after symptom onset led to inpatient admission and a lumbar puncture notable for an opening pressure of 47 mmHg, with normal cell count and protein levels. He had no changes in visual acuity or optic disc edema on dilated fundoscopic examination. The patient was started on acetazolamide, with resolution of episodic emesis at his last follow-up visit 12 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension presents atypically in prepubescent children, with about one-fourth presenting asymptomatically, and only 13–52% presenting with “classic” symptoms. With a prevalence of only 0.6–0.7 per 100,000, much remains unknown regarding the underlying pathophysiology in this demographic. Cyclic vomiting syndrome, however, has a much higher prevalence in this age group, with a prevalence of 0.4–1.9 per 100. It is thought to be an idiopathic, periodic disorder of childhood, often linked to neurological conditions such as abdominal migraines, epilepsy, mitochondrial disorders, and structural lesions such as chiari malformation and posterior fossa tumors. While cyclic vomiting syndrome is thought to have a benign course, untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension can have long-term detrimental effects, such as visual loss or even blindness. We present a case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension presenting with symptoms resembling cyclic vomiting syndrome in a 4-year-old child, diagnosed 10 months after initial onset of symptoms. We aim to demonstrate the need for a high level of clinical suspicion and the need for further investigation into underlying pathophysiology in this vulnerable population.","Talukder, Nafee T.; Clorfeine, Amanda H.; Black, Moira K.; Moody, Shade B.",J Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03068-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461990/,400

However, the association between key clinical variables and a patient’s downstream clinical course is incompletely understood. We sought to fill this knowledge gap in order to inform emergency management of the COVID-19 patient. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults presenting to 21 U.S. community EDs with symptomatic COVID-19 from 2/21/2020 - 4/5/2020 with an in-system SARS-CoV-2 positive laboratory test 21 days before or after the index visit. Demographic, clinical, radiographic and laboratory variables were collected from electronic health records using a combination of manual chart review and electronic data extraction. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between patient characteristics and two primary outcomes: (1) hospitalization from the index visit;and (2) critical illness, defined as either death or a requirement for respiratory support of high flow nasal cannula, non-rebreather mask, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation within 21 days. Results: Among 801 study-eligible patients, 28% were ≥65 years of age, 47% were female and 24% were non-Hispanic white. 393 patients (49%) were hospitalized and 161 (20%) had critical illness. Adjusted statistically significant predictors (p<0.05) of initial hospitalization included abnormal pulmonary auscultation, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), measured fever, and abnormal respiratory vital signs (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation). Independent predictors (p<0.05) of critical illness included a history of hypertension, abnormal chest x-ray, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, elevated BUN, measured fever, and abnormal respiratory vital signs (Table). Conclusion: In this large, diverse study of ED patients with COVID-19 in a pre-vaccine and pre-variant era, we identified clinical variables that were independent predictors of hospitalization and critical illness.

647341,Use of glucocorticoids in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis,2020-06-30,"Previous studies find preventative behaviors designed to reduce the number of infections during emerging disease outbreaks are associated with perceived risk of disease susceptibility. Few studies have attempted to identify underlying factors that explain differences in perceptions of risk during an infectious disease outbreak. Drawing from two early waves of American Trends Panel (n=7,441), as well as a National Science Foundation funded, Qualtrics national panel survey from the early stages of the pandemic (n=10,368), we test whether race and ethnicity, gender, and age were associated with six perceived threat and fear outcomes related to COVID-19. Results demonstrate race and ethnicity, gender, and age play a significant role in shaping threat and fear perceptions of COVID-19, but depending on the outcome, relationships vary in direction and magnitude. In some cases, historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups were more likely to report high fear and perceive coronavirus as a major threat to population and individual health, whereas, in others cases, the same marginalized racial and ethnic groups were less likely to perceive coronavirus to be a serious threat to the immune-comprised and the elderly population. We also find women were generally more likely to report high levels of threat and fear of COVID-19. Finally, we observe a clear age difference, whereby adults in older age groups report high-risk perceptions of COVID-19. Findings can inform public health programs designed to educate communities on the benefits of engaging in effective preventative practices during emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Niño, Michael; Harris, Casey; Drawve, Grant; Fitzpatrick, Kevin M.",SSM Popul Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352827320303542; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344747/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827320303542?v=s5,400

The World Health Organization has estimated the impact of reductions in the performance of global tuberculosis (TB) detection and care on TB deaths. However, the actual impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB deaths in China remains unclear. WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? The stringent public interventions to fight COVID-19 including lockdown led to more than 20% decrease of TB detection in China. It was predicted that the reduction of TB detection might result in 11,700 excess deaths based on assumption of no detection rebound. Based on the prediction the total deaths will be 51,100 in 2020 which might surpass the deaths in 2011. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? Rapid restoration of TB diagnosis and care services is critical for minimizing the potential effects on TB-related deaths and bringing TB burden back to control. It is urgent to ramp up case detection including active case finding and to provide an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured treatment and care for TB cases in post-COVID-19 outbreak.","Xu, Caihong; Li, Tao; Hu, Dongmei; Zhang, Hui; Zhao, Yanlin; Liu, Jianjun",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594898/,400
649930,Procalcitonin in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A meta-analysis,2020-03-04,"BACKGROUND: Rural and urban differences in health outcomes and behaviors have been well-documented, with significant rural health disparities frequently highlighted. Mobile health (mHealth) apps, such as meditation apps, are a novel method for improving health and behaviors. These apps may be a critical health promotion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially be used to address rural health disparities. However, limited research has assessed whether meditation app health outcomes are associated with rural and urban residence, and it is unclear whether disparities in health and behaviors between rural and urban populations would persist among meditation app users. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status, psychological outcomes, and physical activity among users of a mobile meditation app. We further aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity, and to explore changes in these outcomes in rural versus urban app users over time. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted among subscribers to the meditation app Calm. Eligible participants completed online baseline surveys from April to June 2020, and follow-up surveys from June to September 2020, assessing demographics, psychological outcomes, physical activity, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. RESULTS: Participants (N=8392) were mostly female (7041/8392, 83.9%), non-Hispanic (7855/8392, 93.6%), and White (7704/8392, 91.8%); had high socioeconomic status (income ≥US $100,000: 4389/8392, 52.3%; bachelor’s degree or higher: 7251/8392, 86.4%); and resided in a metropolitan area core (rural-urban commuting area code 1: 7192/8392, 85.7%). Rural or urban status was not associated with baseline stress, depression, anxiety, pre–COVID-19 and current physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Repeated-measures models showed overall decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on physical activity from baseline to follow-up, and no significant changes in stress or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress and mental health over time. Models also showed no significant main effects of rural or urban status, COVID-19 statewide prevalence at baseline, or change in COVID-19 statewide prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find associations between rural or urban status and psychological outcomes (ie, stress, depression, and anxiety), physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Rural or urban status does not appear to drive differences in outcomes among meditation app users, and the use of mHealth apps should continue to be explored as a health promotion strategy in both rural and urban populations. Furthermore, our results did not show negative cumulative effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes and physical activity among app users in our sample, the majority of whom were urban, White, female, and of high socioeconomic status. Further research is needed to investigate meditation app use as a health promotion strategy in rural and urban populations.","Bhuiyan, Nishat; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad; Huberty, Jennifer",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900930/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26037,400

We aimed to investigate the relationship between markers of endothelial activation, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID-19 patients and study their association with disease severity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 181 hospitalized COVID-19 patients randomly selected with equal distribution of survivors and non-survivors. Patients who died had significantly lower ADAMTS13 activity, significantly higher LDH, schistocytes and von Willebrand Factor levels compared to patients discharged alive. Only 30% of patients with an initial ADAMTS13 activity <43% survived vs. 60% with ADAMTS13 ≥43% who survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 may manifest as a TMA-like illness in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes on admission may warrant a work-up for TMA. These findings indicate the need for future investigation to study the relationship between endothelial and coagulation activation and the efficacy of TMA treatments in COVID-19.","Sweeney, Joseph M.; Barouqa, Mohammad; Krause, Gregory J.; Gonzalez-Lugo, Jesus D.; Rahman, Shafia; Gil, Morayma Reyes",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215608v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106812/,400
651669,The Potential Role of Extracorporeal Cytokine Removal in Hemodynamic Stabilization in Hyperinflammatory Shock,2021-07-01,"Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in immunity and inflammation, including antiviral actions. Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2-activating composition PB125(®) downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL-1-beta, IL-6, TNF-α, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-γ-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the “cytokine storm” observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm.","McCord, Joe M.; Hybertson, Brooks M.; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Geraci, Kara P.; Gao, Bifeng",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32545518/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9060518,400

The need for wearing personal protective measures and their cutaneous side effects, detection of related or specific COVID-19 skin eruptions, and the evaluation of certain risk groups of immunosuppressed dermatologic patients have initiated significant discussions about various therapeutic interventions and, in particular, about biologic therapy for psoriasis and for autoinflammatory, orphan, or malignant cutaneous disorders. Autoimmune bullous dermatoses have been of concern due to their chronic course, at times life-threatening prognosis, and the need for prolonged and often aggressive immunomodulatory therapy.

652773,Evaluation of dynamic lung changes during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by quantitative computed tomography,2020-09-19,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country in Europe affected by COVID-19: the emergency started on February 20, 2020, culminating with national lockdown on March 11, which terminated on May 4, 2020. We describe how the pandemic affected Emergency Department (ED) accesses in a tertiary children’s hospital, composed by two different pediatric centers, one located in Rome’s city center and the second, Palidoro (regional COVID-19 center), in its surrounding metropolitan area, both in the Lazio region, analyzing the profile of admitted patients during the pandemic period in terms of their general characteristics (at presentation in the ED’s) and urgent hospitalizations compared to prepandemic period. METHODS: The study compare the period between the 21st of February and the 30th of April 2020, covering the three phases of the national responses (this period will be referred to as the pandemic period) with the same period of 2019 (prepandemic period). The study analyzes the number of ED visits and urgent hospitalizations and their distribution according to selected characteristics. RESULTS: The reduction of ED visits was 56 and 62%, respectively in Rome and Palidoro centers. The higher relative decline was encountered for Diseases of Respiratory System, and for Diseases of the Nervous System and Sense Organs. A doubling of the relative frequency of hospitalizations was observed, going from 14.2 to 24.4% in Rome and from 6.4 to 10.3% in Palidoro. In terms of absolute daily numbers the decrease of urgent hospitalizations was less sharp than ED visits. For pathologies such as peritonitis, tumors or other possible life-treathening conditions we did not observe a significative increase due to delayed access. CONCLUSIONS: In the pandemic period there was a general reduction in the number of children referred to ED, such reduction was greater in low-acuity levels. The reduction for respiratory tract infections and other communicable diseases during school closure and the national lockdown must make us reflect on the possible impact that these conditions may have on the health system, in particular the ED, at the reopening of schools. The major problem remains the fear for possible diagnostic delays in life-threatening or crippling diseases; our study doesn’t demonstrate an increase in number or significant delay in some serious conditions such as tumors, peritonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ileo-colic intussusception and testis/ovary torsion. A continuous, deep re-organizational process step by step of the ED is nececessary in the present and upcoming pandemic situation.","Raucci, Umberto; Musolino, Anna Maria; Di Lallo, Domenico; Piga, Simone; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Pisani, Mara; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Reale, Antonino; Ciofi degli Atti, Marta Luisa; Villani, Alberto; Raponi, Massimiliano",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514391/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-00976-y,400

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.","Ricci Cabello, I.; Meneses Echavez, J.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how often patients referred to home health care at hospital discharge receive it and whether there is evidence of disparities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used Medicare data regarding the postacute home health care setting from October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016. The participants were Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who were discharged alive from a hospital with a referral to home health care (2 379 506 discharges). Statistical analysis was performed from July 2019 to June 2020. EXPOSURES: Hospital referral to home health care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included whether discharges received their first home health care visit within 14 days of hospital discharge and the number of days between hospital discharge and the first home health visit. Differences in the likelihood of receiving home health care across patient, zip code, and hospital characteristics were also examined. RESULTS: Among 2 379 506 discharges from the hospital with a home health care referral, 1 358 697 patients (57.1%) were female, 468 762 (19.7%) were non-White, and 466 383 (19.6%) were dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid; patients had a mean (SD) age of 73.9 (11.9) years and 4.1 (2.1) Elixhauser comorbidities. Only 1 284 300 patients (54.0%) discharged from the hospital with a home health referral received home health care services within 14 days of discharge. Of the remaining 1 095 206 patients (46.0%) discharged, 37.7% (896 660 discharges) never received any home health care, while 8.3% (198 546 discharges) were institutionalized or died within 14 days without a preceding home health care visit. Patients who were Black or Hispanic received home health at lower rates than did patients who were White (48.0% [95% CI, 47.8%-48.1%] of Black and 46.1% [95% CI, 45.7%-46.5%] of Hispanic discharges received home health within 14 days compared with 55.3% [95% CI, 55.2%-55.4%] of White discharges). In addition, disadvantaged patients waited longer for their first home health care visit. For example, patients living in high-unemployment zip codes waited a mean of 2.0 days (95% CI, 2.0-2.0 days), whereas those living in low-unemployment zip codes waited 1.8 days (95% CI, 1.8-1.8 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Disparities in the use of home health care remain an issue in the US. As home health care is increasingly presented as a safer alternative to institutional postacute care during coronavirus disease 2019, and payment reforms continue to pressure hospitals to discharge patients home, ensuring the availability of safe and equitable care will be crucial to maintaining high-quality care.","Li, Jun; Qi, Mingyu; Werner, Rachel M.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876682/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15470,400

DESIGN: Scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and manuscripts on preprint servers from January 2020 to 15 September 2020. PRIMARY MEASURE: Seroprevalence estimate (and lower and upper CIs). For studies conducted across a country or territory, we used the seroprevalence estimate and the upper and lower CIs and compared them to the total number of reported infections to calculate the ratio of reported to expected infections. RESULTS: We identified 23 population-based seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe. Among 12 general population studies, seroprevalence ranged from 0.42% among residual clinical samples in Greece to 13.6% in an area of high transmission in Gangelt, Germany. Of the eight studies in blood donors, seroprevalence ranged from 0.91% in North-Western Germany to 23.3% in a high-transmission area in Lombardy region, Italy. In three studies which recruited individuals through employment, seroprevalence ranged from 0.5% among factory workers in Frankfurt, Germany, to 10.2% among university employees in Milan, Italy. In comparison to nationally reported cases, the extent of infection, as derived from these seroprevalence estimates, is manyfold higher and largely heterogeneous.

From these two concepts, typologies (logical and historical) of societies are inferred and examined in their basic features. To these ends, some well-known concepts such as entropy, order, system, network, synergy, norm, autopoieticity, fetality, and complexity are revisited and placed into an integrated framework. The core body of this paper addresses the structure and the mechanism of social entropy, understood as an institutionally working counterpart of social order.

Numerous clinical trials have followed; however, issues such as infusional toxicity and cellular rejection have been reported. To address these problems associated with cell-based therapy, MSC exosome therapy was developed and has shown promising clinical outcomes. MSC exosomes are nanosized vesicles secreted from MSCs and represent a non-cellular therapeutic agent. MSC exosomes retain therapeutic features of the cells from which they originated including genetic material, lipids, and proteins. Similar to MSCs, exosomes can induce cell differentiation, immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and tumor suppression. MSC exosomes have therefore been employed in several experimental models and clinical studies. Here, we review the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived exosomes and summarize currently ongoing clinical trials according to disease type. In addition, we propose several functional enhancement strategies for the effective clinical application of MSC exosome therapy.","Lee, Byung-Chul; Kang, Insung; Yu, Kyung-Rok",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670202/,400

The epidemiological trends of mild COVID-19 are however still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study during the outbreak. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies against the Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Setting: Blood center at a leading academic hospital serving as COVID-19 referral center. Participants: We considered a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789). Main outcome measures: The main outcome was the prevalence of IgG/IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies . Results: The test had a 98.3% specificity and 100% sensitivity, and for IgG was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (2.3 to 7.9; P<0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in seroprevalence to 7.1% (4.4 to 10.8), due to a rise in IgG+ to 5% (2.8 to 8.2; P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7, SE 1.3%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM+) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P<0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 4.4-10.8% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.","Valenti, L.; Bergna, A.; Pelusi, S.; Facciotti, F.; Lai, A.; Tarkowski, M.; Berzuini, A.; Caprioli, F.; Santoro, L.; Baselli, G.; Della Ventura, C.; Erba, E.; Bosari, S.; Galli, M.; Zehender, G.; Prati, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20098442v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098442,400

Gene targeting studies have distinguished four effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. These effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation, and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication.

A digital qualitative research strategy was applied to boxing clubs, boxers, and boxing coaches in Norway. A total of 46 official clubs, athletes, and coach pages on Facebook were followed from 12th March to 30th June 2020, resulting in a sample of 78 social media posts (texts, photos, and videos). A content analysis approach was used for the material. The results show that the use of digital tools amongst the studied Norwegian coaches and boxing clubs varied in frequency and form during the spring of 2020 (COVID-19 shutdown). For them, the most frequent use of digital instruments was to communicate internally and externally about the COVID-19 situation, national rules and guidelines. The material demonstrated that online training strategies varied between different constellations of three specific factors: (1) synchronized (live-streamed) online training and unsynchronized online training (at home training videos and programmes), (2) publicly published online training that was only accessible through digital registration, and (3) free online training and online training that was only available to paying members. For the athletes in the material, the most frequent content was social media posts for self-promotion purposes.

662307,Clinical features and survival analysis of 97 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients,2021,"Tall buildings in cold climates have unique challenges in maintaining indoor air quality due to stack effect. During the heating season, interior air buoyancy creates large pressure differentials in vertical shafts that can drive airflow from lower floors into upper floors. This pressure differential can result in the spread of contaminants throughout a building. Most recently, concern over COVID-19 has increased attention to the potential spread of airborne diseases in densely populated buildings. For many multi-unit residential buildings, suite ventilation has traditionally relied upon fresh air supplied through a mechanically pressurized corridor. In cold climates, large pressure differentials created by stack-effect can reduce the effectiveness of this approach. Multizone and CFD simulations are employed to analyze airflow and contaminant spread due to stack effect. Simulations are conducted on an idealized model of a 10-storey building using a range of experimentally derived airtightness parameters. Simulations demonstrate stack effect can reduce corridor ventilation to suites and even reverse the airflow for leakier buildings. Reduced airflow to suites can result in the accumulation of contaminants. Reversal of the airflow can allow contaminants from a suite to spread throughout the building. Contaminant spread is illustrated as a function of mechanical ventilation, building airtightness, and ambient temperatures. Strategies to reduce the influence of stack effect on mechanically pressurized corridors are discussed.","Mckeen, Philip; Liao, Zaiyi",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025908/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-021-0787-6,400

Ill persons should remain home when they first become symptomatic, but forced isolation and quarantine are ineffective and impractical. If the pandemic is severe, social distancing measures such as school closures should be considered. Nonessential domestic travel to affected areas should be deferred. Hand and respiratory hygiene should be routine; mask use should be based on setting and risk, and contaminated household surfaces should be disinfected.

Several types of vaccines have been proposed and many of them have finally been approved and used in different countries. The different types of vaccines have different vaccine parameters, and therefore, this situation induces the necessity of modeling mathematically the scenario of multiple imperfect vaccines. In this paper, we introduce a SIR-based model considering different vaccines, and study the basic properties of the model, including the stability of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is less than 1. A sequence of further results aims to enumerate the conditions where the reproduction number can be decreased (or increased). Two important mathematical propositions indicate that in general vaccination might not be enough to contain an outbreak and that the addition of new vaccines could be counterproductive if the leakiness parameter is greater than a threshold {eta}. This model, despite its simplicity, was validated with data of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries: Israel, Chile, Germany, Lithuania, and Czech Republic, observing that improvements for the vaccine campaigns can be suggested by the developed theory.","Aguilar-Canto, F.

667223,Risk Exposure to Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Pregnant Healthcare Workers,2020-04-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Human natural killer (NK) cells can be targeted to tumor antigens by their IgG Fc receptors that interact with the Fc regions of antibodies that recognize surface proteins on cancer cells. Therapeutic antibodies specific to cancer cell antigens are used to treat various malignancies. NK cells in turn kill antibody-bound tumor cells through a process known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The ADCC response of NK cells can be modulated by changes in the antibody or Fc receptor. In this review, we detail the functions of Fc receptors in human NK cells and expand upon current research illustrating how engineering monoclonal antibodies and Fc receptors enhance NK cell-mediated ADCC for the treatment of cancer. ABSTRACT: Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the most widely used and characterized immunotherapy for hematologic and solid tumors. The significance of this therapy is their direct and indirect effects on tumor cells, facilitated by the antibody’s antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and fragment crystallizable region (Fc region), respectively. The Fab can modulate the function of cell surface markers on tumor cells in an agonistic or antagonistic manner, whereas the Fc region can be recognized by an Fc receptor (FcR) on leukocytes through which various effector functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), can be elicited. This process is a key cytolytic mechanism of natural killer (NK) cells. These innate lymphocytes in the human body recognize tumor-bound antibodies exclusively by the IgG Fc receptor CD16A (FcγRIIIA). Two allelic versions of CD16A bind IgG with either lower or higher affinity. Cancer patients homozygous for the higher affinity allele of CD16A have been reported to respond significantly better to mAb therapies for various malignancies. These studies revealed that mAb therapy efficacy positively correlates with higher affinity binding to CD16A. Approaches to enhance tumor antigen targeting by NK cells by modifying the Fc portion of antibodies or the FcR on NK cells are the focus of this review.","Dixon, Kate J.; Wu, Jianming; Walcheck, Bruce",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467027/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13020312,400

Objective: To identify the impact of a history of pre-maturity on in-hospital complications and mortality in patients under 24 months of age who were hospitalized for VRIs over a period of 5 years. Material and Methods: This was a propensity score-matched study. The database was compiled by physicians, electronically validated by engineers, and analyzed by statisticians. Patients diagnosed with VRIs (based on International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10]) codes B974, J12, J120–J129X, J168, J17, J171, J178, J20, J203–J209, J21, J210, J211, J218, J219, J22X, and J189) from 2013 to 2017 were enrolled in the study. The subjects were classified into two groups according to the absence or presence of a history of pre-maturity (P070, P072, P073). Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) (Q20–Q26) were excluded. Length of hospital stay, in-hospital complications, surgical procedures, and mortality were analyzed. Statistical Analysis: Patients were matched according to age. For comparisons between groups, Student's t-tests and chi(2) tests were applied. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors related to in-hospital complications and mortality. Results: In total, 5,880 patients were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The average patient age was 14.25 weeks. The presence of pre-maturity (coefficient = 1.16), male sex, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in-hospital infectious complications (coefficient = 11.31), and invasive medical procedures (coefficient = 18.4) increased the number of days of hospitalization. Invasive medical procedures (OR = 6.13), a history of pre-maturity (OR = 2.54), and male sex (OR = 1.78) increased the risk for in-hospital complications. In-hospital infectious complications (OR = 84.2) and invasive medical procedures (OR = 58.4) were risk factors for mortality. Conclusions: A history of pre-maturity increased the length of hospital stay and the rate of in-hospital complications but did not increase mortality in patients under 24 months of age hospitalized for VRIs.","Zurita-Cruz, Jessie; Gutierrez-Gonzalez, Alejandro; Manuel-Apolinar, Leticia; Fernández-Gárate, José Esteban; Arellano-Flores, María Luisa; Correa Gonzalez, Roberto Alejandro; Vázquez-Rosales, Guillermo; Pérez Vieyra, Patricia; Sanchez-Armas, Rocio; Cisneros-González, Nelly",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.499013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072667/,400

Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively.

Blood transfusion was one of them regarding both blood banks (safety, collection, and stocks) and consumption (usual care and unknown specific demand of COVID‐19 patients). The risk of mismatch was sufficient to plan blood transfusion restrictions if stocks became limited. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses of blood transfusion in a tertiary hospital and blood collection in the referring blood bank between February 24 and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Withdrawal of elective surgery and non‐urgent care and admission of 2291 COVID‐19 patients reduced global activity by 33% but transfusion by 17% only. Only 237 (10.3) % of COVID‐19 patients required blood transfusion, including 45 (2.0%) with acute bleeding. Lockdown and cancellation of mobile collection resulted in an 11% reduction in blood donation compared to 2019. The ratio of reduction in blood transfusion to blood donation remained positive and stocks were slightly enhanced. DISCUSSION: Reduction of admissions due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic results only in a moderate decrease of blood transfusion. Incompressible blood transfusions concern urgent surgery, acute bleeding (including some patients with COVID‐19, especially under high anticoagulation), or are supportive for chemotherapy‐induced aplasia or chronic anemia. Lockdown results in a decrease of blood donation by cancellation of mobile donation but with little impact on a short period by mobilization of usual donors.

Supported by its respiratory transmissibility, even by people infected without symptomatic disease, this coronavirus soon began to rapidly spread worldwide. BACKGROUND: Many countries have implemented different infection control and containment strategies due to ongoing community transmission. In this context, contact tracing as well as adequate testing and consequent quarantining of high-risk contacts play leading roles in containing the virus by interrupting infection chains. This approach is especially important in the hospital setting where contacts often cannot be avoided and physical distance is usually not possible. Furthermore, health care workers (HCWs) usually have contact with a variety of vulnerable people, making it essential to identify infections among hospital employees as soon as possible to interrupt the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the facility. Several electronic tools for contact tracing, such as specific software or mobile phone apps, are available for the public health sector. In contrast, contact tracing in hospitals often has to be carried out without helpful electronic tools, and an enormous amount of human resources is typically required. AIM: For rapid contact tracing and effective infection control and management measures for HCWs in hospitals, adapted technical solutions are needed.

678147,Cardiac troponin I in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Evidence from a meta-analysis(),2020-03-10,"Worldwide, virus infections are responsible for many diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality. Vaccinations and therapies are only available for relatively few virus infections and not always where they are needed. However, knowledge of transmission routes can prevent virus infection. In the context of this study, we measured the effects of a secondary school education module, named Viruskenner, on knowledge, attitude, and risk behavior as these relate to virus infections. A nonrandomized intervention study was conducted between April and August 2015 to assess the effect of this 2-month education module on knowledge, attitude, and behavior of 684 secondary school students in the Netherlands, Suriname, and Indonesia. For the Netherlands, a control group of a further 184 students was added. Factor analysis was performed on questions pertaining to attitude and behavior. Comparative analyses between pre- and posttest per country were done using multiple linear regression, independent sample T-tests, and one-way analysis of variance. These showed a significant increase in knowledge about virus infections and the prevention of infectious diseases among the Dutch and Surinamese groups, whereas a trend of increased knowledge was evident among the Indonesian participants. The Dutch control group showed an overall decrease in knowledge. Regression analyses showed that there was a significant interaction effect between participation and time on knowledge, attitude, and awareness and behavior and risk infection. Attitudes improved significantly in the intervention group. Pearson correlation coefficients between knowledge, attitude, and behavior were found to be positive.","Doornekamp, Laura; Stegers-Jager, Karen M.; Vlek, Odette M.; Klop, Tanja; Goeijenbier, Marco; van Gorp, Eric C.

679014,Diagnostics in the Time of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Challenges and Opportunities,2020-12-18,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells of the airway and lungs in humans causing the disease COVID-19. This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions. Our findings reveal a landscape of ligand-receptor interactions in the lung caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and point to potential interventions to reduce the burden of neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19 pulmonary disease. In particular, our work highlights opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under development rheumatoid arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) drugs to treat high risk or severe COVID-19 cases.","Ray, Pradipta R.; Wangzhou, Andi; Ghneim, Nizar; Yousuf, Muhammad S.; Paige, Candler; Tavares-Ferreira, Diana; Mwirigi, Juliet M.; Shiers, Stephanie; Sankaranarayanan, Ishwarya; McFarland, Amelia J.; Neerukonda, Sanjay V.; Davidson, Steve; Dussor, Gregory; Burton, Michael D.; Price, Theodore J.",Brain Behav Immun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.078; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030670X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030670X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497778/,400

679932,Vascular Inflammation in Lungs of Patients with Fatal Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Possible Role for the NLRP3 Inflammasome,2021-09-01,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has had a severe impact on morbidity and mortality among nursing home (NH) residents. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us to better mitigate risk of spread. Both asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C, for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records METHODS: We hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals earlier. We collected information about age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specific comorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and an alternative hypothetical model to test measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA reality. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Our subjects were 6,176 residents of the VA NHs who underwent SARS-CoV-2 trigger testing. RESULTS: We showed that a change from baseline of >0.4C identifies 47% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive NH residents early, and achieves earlier detection by 42.2 hours. Range improves early detection to 55% when paired with a 37.2C cutoff, and achieves earlier detection by 44.4 hours. Temperature elevation >0.4C from baseline, when combined with a 0.7C range, would detect 52% early, leading to earlier detection by more than 3 days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at the expense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger tests ordered in the VA system of 40,691. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our model suggests that current clinical screening for SARS-CoV-2 in NHs can be substantially improved upon by triggering testing using a patient-derived baseline temperature with a 0.4C degree relative elevation or temperature variability of 0.7C trigger threshold for SARS-CoV2 testing. Such triggers could be automated in facilities that track temperatures in their electronic records.","Elhamamsy, Salaheldin; DeVone, Frank; Bayer, Tom; Halladay, Chris; Cadieux, Marilyne; McConeghy, Kevin; Rajan, Ashna; Sachar, Moniyka; Mujahid, Nadia; Nanda, Aman; McNicoll, Lynn; Rudolph, James L; Gravenstein, Stefan",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.21260676v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341800/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21260676,400

To improve stability, pBAS, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid was used to construct a full length cDNA clone of BVDV strain SD1, which has a genomic size of 12.3kb. The resulting clone pBSD1 was propagated stably for at least 10 passages in three different Escherichia coli strains at two different incubation temperatures as determined by sequencing the progeny plasmids. In vitro transcripts derived from pBSD1 were homologous in size and had an infectious efficiency as high as ∼5.0×105 FFU/μg RNA in MDBK cells. The recovered virus, BSD1, harbored the five artificially introduced silent point mutations as genetic markers and was similar to wild type SD1 in viral growth kinetics, RNA replication, and protein expression.

METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter real-life study carried out during the first pandemic wave in 11 Italian Hospitals. In total, 1391 patients were included. The primary end-point was a composite of in-hospital mortality or admission to ICU, whichever came first. The key secondary end-point was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Multivariable models were based on 1183 patients with complete data. Reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and/or expected by physicians in the next days since admission was found to have a negative prognostic impact for both the primary and secondary end-point (P < .001 for both). No association with BMI and WL was observed. Other predictors of outcomes were age and presence of multiple comorbidities. A significant interaction between obesity and multi-morbidity (≥2) was detected. Obesity was found to be a risk factor for composite end-point (HR = 1.36 [95%CI, 1.03–1.80]; P = .031) and a protective factor against in-hospital mortality (HR = 0.32 [95%CI, 0.20–0.51]; P < .001) in patients with and without multiple comorbidities, respectively. Secondary analysis (patients, N = 829), further adjusted for high C-reactive protein (>21 mg/dL) and LDH (>430 mU/mL) levels yielded consistent findings. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and/or expected by physicians in the next days since admission was associated with negative clinical outcomes in non-critically ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This simple and easily obtainable parameter may be useful to identify patients at highest risk of poor prognosis, who may benefit from prompt nutritional support. The presence of comorbidities could be the key factor, which may determine the protective or harmful role of a high body mass index in COVID-19.","Caccialanza, Riccardo; Formisano, Elena; Klersy, Catherine; Ferretti, Virginia; Ferrari, Alessandra; Demontis, Stefania; Mascheroni, Annalisa; Masi, Sara; Crotti, Silvia; Lobascio, Federica; Cerutti, Nadia; Orlandoni, Paolo; Dalla Costa, Cloè; Redaelli, Elena; Fabbri, Alessandra; Malesci, Alberto; Corrao, Salvatore; Bordandini, Lorella; Cereda, Emanuele",Clin Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353669/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561421003162; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561421003162?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.06.020,400

The answer advanced is that such duties are grounded in the dependence that trade generates. The essay puts forward four conditions that a plausible account of grounding in trade must meet: it must admit of degrees, explain the distinctly international character of trade justice, ground both procedural and distributive duties, and it must be a necessary feature of all trade relationships which generate duties of justice. A dependence account of grounding meets all four conditions, and does so in an intuitively compelling way. While other accounts of what grounds duties of trade justice can meet some of the conditions, none can meet all of them. Relative to rival candidates, then, the dependence account provides a firmer foundation for the ongoing attempts to develop a comprehensive theory of trade justice.","Ó Laoghaire, Tadhg",Res Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989374/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11158-020-09482-0,400

The main protease (M(pro)), encoded as part of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, is responsible for 11 different cleavages of these viral polyproteins to produce mature proteins required for viral replication. M(pro) is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. Certain proteins in cells under oxidative stress undergo modification of reactive cysteines. We show M(pro) is susceptible to glutathionylation, leading to inhibition of dimerization and activity. Activity of glutathionylated M(pro) could be restored with reducing agents or glutaredoxin. Analytical studies demonstrated that glutathionylated M(pro) primarily exists as a monomer and that modification of a single cysteine with glutathione is sufficient to block dimerization and inhibit its activity. Gel filtration studies as well as analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that glutathionylated M(pro) exists as a monomer. Tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of M(pro) as well as experiments using a C300S M(pro) mutant revealed that Cys300, which is located at the dimer interface, is a primary target of glutathionylation. Moreover, Cys300 is required for inhibition of activity upon M(pro) glutathionylation. These findings indicate that M(pro) dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of a non-active site cysteine, Cys300, which itself is not required for M(pro) activity, and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block M(pro) dimerization and activity. This feature of M(pro) may have relevance to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and related bat coronaviruses.","Davis, David A.; Bulut, Haydar; Shrestha, Prabha; Yaparla, Amulya; Jaeger, Hannah K.; Hattori, Shin-ichiro; Wingfield, Paul T.; Mieyal, John J.; Mitsuya, Hiroaki; Yarchoan, Robert",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02094-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399606/,400

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rho=0.79; P=0<0.001).

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.","Jackwood, Mark W.; Lee, Dong-Hun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28472110/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176709,400

In this space, each point corresponds to a genome. The natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes. Currently, there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological information. Here, we propose a new graphical representation for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method and prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. Using these moment vectors, we have constructed a novel genome space as a subspace in R(N). It allows us to show that the SARS-CoV is most closely related to a coronavirus from the palm civet not from a bird as initially suspected, and the newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 is more closely related to SARS than to any other known member of group 2 coronavirus.

Apart from respiratory malfunction, COVID-19 causes a system-wide thromboembolic state, leading to serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular manifestations. However, our knowledge regarding retinal manifestations due to systemic COVID-19 is minimal. This systematic review has comprehensively summarized all retinal manifestations secondary to COVID-19 disease recorded till date since the beginning of the pandemic. METHODS: All studies published till November 27, 2020, which have reported retinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients were systematically reviewed using the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: We included 15 articles: 11 case reports and four cross-sectional case series. The most commonly reported manifestations which did not affect visual acuity were retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. The most common vision threatening manifestation was retinal vein occlusion with associated macular edema. Rarely, patients may also present with retinal arterial occlusions and ocular inflammation. These manifestations may occur from as soon as within a week after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to more than 6 weeks after. CONCLUSION: Mostly causing milder disease, COVID-19 may however lead to severe life-threatening thromboembolic complications, and systemic antithrombotic therapy has been suggested as a prophylactic and therapeutic management strategy for patients affected with serious systemic disease. However, both sick and apparently healthy patients may suffer from various retinal complications which may lead to loss of vision as well. No consensus regarding management of retinal complications with anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory medications have been proposed; however, they may be tackled on individual basis.","Sen, Sagnik; Kannan, Naresh Babu; Kumar, Jayant; Rajan, Renu P.; Kumar, Karthik; Baliga, Girish; Reddy, Harshavardhan; Upadhyay, Anubhav; Ramasamy, Kim",Int Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-01996-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379290/,400

687507,Serum citrullinated histone H3 concentrations differentiate patients with septic verses non-septic shock and correlate with disease severity,2020-09-30,"COVID-19 has been a global health threat. We aimed to investigate the nutrition status of COVID-19 patients and evaluate the prognostic value of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in these patients. 348 severe patients with COVID-19 were collected. Based on the CONUT score, 161 (46.3%) patients had mild malnutrition while 139 (39.9%) patients had moderate-severe malnutrition. Compared to the patients in normal and mild groups, the patients in moderate-severe group were older, more male, had higher counts of white blood cell and neutrophil as well as higher serum levels of C-reactive protein. Nearly half of patients (44.6%) in moderate-severe group developed acute cardiac injury, while 6.3% and 15.5% patients in normal and mild group, respectively. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition exhibited a higher mortality than those patients with normal and mild malnutrition. Multivariate regression analysis showed the CONUT score was the independent predictor of death in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio: 1.410; 95%CI: 1.089–1.825; p = 0.009). Malnutrition is significantly associated with poor outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with normal nutrition status is relative favorable. The CONUT score independently predicts the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, which can help physicians to clarify patients with poor prognosis.","Wei, Chenchen; Liu, Ya; Li, Yu; Zhang, Yi; Zhong, Ming; Meng, Xiao",J Clin Biochem Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041506/; https://doi.org/10.3164/jcbn.20-91,400
688026,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Associated With Febrile Status Epilepticus in a Child,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND: The use of cytokine-blocking agents has been proposed to modulate the inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab and anakinra were included in the local protocol as an optional treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study evaluated the effects of therapy with cytokine blocking agents on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: The association between therapy with tocilizumab or anakinra and in-hospital mortality was assessed in consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU with moderate to severe ARDS. The association was evaluated by comparing patients who received to those who did not receive tocilizumab or anakinra and by using different multivariable Cox models adjusted for variables related to poor outcome, for the propensity to be treated with tocilizumab or anakinra and after patient matching. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients who received immunotherapy (49 tocilizumab, 17 anakinra) and 28 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were included. The in-hospital crude mortality was 30,3% in treated patients and 50% in nontreated (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.05, p=0.069). The adjusted Cox model showed an association between therapy with immunotherapy and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83, p=0.015). This protective effect was further confirmed in the analysis adjusted for propensity score, in the propensity-matched cohort and in the cohort of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation within 2 hours after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Although important limitations, our study showed that cytokine-blocking agents seem to be safe and to improve survival in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Coloretti, Irene; Busani, Stefano; Biagioni, Emanuela; Venturelli, Sophie; Munari, Elena; Sita, Marco; DallAra, Lorenzo; Tosi, Martina; Clini, Enrico; Tonelli, Roberto; Fantini, Riccardo; Mussini, Cristina; Meschiari, Marianna; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Cossarizza, Andrea; Alfano, Gaetano; Girardis, Massimo",Multidiscip Respir Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040779/; https://doi.org/10.4081/mrm.2021.737,400
688658,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy: Double Reading of Chest CT Examination,2021-01-25,"The COVID-19 outbreak forced Italian students to reduce their daily activities, inducing a seden-tary attitude that was worsened by distanced learning. This study aimed to survey the physical activity levels that were maintained before and during the social restrictions following the pan-demic, their correlation to musculoskeletal pain, as well as analyzing the impact of these COVID-19 restrictions on pain and fatigue that affects daily life activities. A total of 2044 students completed the online questionnaire, of which the results of 1654 participants were eligible. Before the pandemic, the levels of physical activity were distributed as: 19.9% no activity, 30.1% light ac-tivity, 21.5% moderate activity, and 28.5% high activity. After one year of the pandemic, 30.6% of the participants were inactive, 48.1%, 10.9%, and 10.5% stated as maintaining, respectively, light, moderate and high levels of physical activity. Furthermore, 43.5% reported neck pain and 33.5% stated to experience low back pain. Physical activity levels lower than 150 min/week may have predisposed students to suffer from neck pain (1.95 OR at 95% CI, 1.44–2.64) and low back pain (1.79 OR at 95% CI, 1.29–2.49). A positive correlation between physical activity levels, Verbal Descriptive Scale (VDS), and pain frequency have been observed for neck and low back pain (p-value < 0.05). Finally, low physical activity levels were associated with musculoskeletal pain onset and pain worsening.","Roggio, Federico; Trovato, Bruno; Ravalli, Silvia; Di Rosa, Michelino; Maugeri, Grazia; Bianco, Antonino; Palma, Antonio; Musumeci, Giuseppe",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444427/,400
688876,An extended fuzzy decision-making framework using hesitant fuzzy sets for the drug selection to treat the mild symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: The onset of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic brought about multiple crises with financial, social, and political dimensions, and problems involving absence or scarcity of medication, food, and other amenities. COVID led to reports of severe hunger, stress, sexual violence, and associated complications. This study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of sexual violence, hunger, stress, indoor fighting, and related complications caused by the corona virus, and determining factors associated with it. METHODS: A cross-sectional design study involving a total of 1288 participants recruited from Amhara Metropolitan cities was implemented. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding experience of sexual violence, hunger, stress, indoor fighting, and other complications faced due to COVID-19. A statistical analysis was done by fitting binary logistic regression model, independent t-test and Chi-squared test. RESULTS: From the total participants, 1288 (26.2%) were displaced, while 39.9% were unemployed due COVID-19. About half of the participants (48.8%) experienced general distress, 33.8% faced sexual violence, 18.2% experienced hunger, 8.4% faced indoor fighting. The majority (81.7%) of non-corona virus patients in government health-care institutions faced lack of treatment. For every unit increase of monthly income during COVID-19, the estimated odds of participants experiencing sexual violence decreased by 31.3% (aOR=0.687). Educational level, work status, and monthly salary before and during corona virus were important factors of hunger. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic led to considerably high prevalence of sexual violence, hunger, stress, and indoor fighting. Work status of participants was an important associated factor of hunger, stress, and indoor fighting. Sex of participants and their monthly income were significantly associated with increase in sexual violence during COVID-19. In addition to a general economic recession, a decrease in treatment of non-COVID-19 patients was noticed, particularly in government hospitals.","Tesfaw, Lijalem Melie; Kassie, Aragaw Bizualem; Flatie, Belaynesh Tazebew",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s297148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471394/,400
