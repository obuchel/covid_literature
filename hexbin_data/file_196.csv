1495,"Effects and cost of glycyrrhizin in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in members of the Japanese maritime self-defense force: Preliminary report of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, alternate-day treatment assignment clinical trial",2004-01-01,"Background: Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) account for at least half of all acute illnesses. Specific antiviral therapy has not been developed against most respiratory viruses thought to cause URTIs. The pharmacologic action of glycyrrhizin has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory activity, modulation of the immune system, inhibition of virus growth, and inactivation of viruses. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, efficacy, and cost of glycyrrhizin in improving the severity and duration of signs and symptoms of URTIs. The primary end point was tolerability, and the secondary and points included improvement in signs and symptoms of URTI and cost. Methods: Members of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (SDF) treated for URTIs from January 2002 to May 2002 in the SDF Etajima Hospital (Hiroshima, Japan) were eligible for this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, alternate-day treatment assignment study. All patients in this study fulfilled the following enrollment criteria: admitted to the hospital on the first arrival day as an outpatient; fever (body temperature <38.0°C) with signs and symptoms of URTI (headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis); and had not received antibiotics or oseltamivir phosphate for 4 weeks before the study. Patients who were admitted on an even day received an IV drip infusion of 40 mL of glycyrrhizin (0.2%) and 500 mL of lactated Ringer's solution daily during hospitalization (glycyrrhizin group). Patients who were admitted on an odd day received an IV drip infusion of 500 mL/d of lactated Ringer's solution only (control group). Adverse effects were assessed by the physicians during hospitalization, using patient interview and laboratory analysis. Results: Forty-one consecutive patients entered the study; 15 patients (15 men, 0 women; mean [SD] age, 25.2 [1.5] years) were assigned to the glycyrrhizin group and 269 patients (24 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 22.6 [0.9] years) were assigned to the control group. The 2 groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter (P = 0.01), the mean maximum body temperature 24 to 48 hours after admission was less (P = 0.05), and the cost of therapy (P = 0.03) was less in the glycyrrhizin group than the control group. No AEs were reported. Conclusions: In this study of hospitalized patients with URTIs, glycyrrhizin therapy was associated with a shorter hospitalization, lower-grade fever, and lower cost of therapy compared with controls, showing that it may be beneficial to patients with URTIs without acute bacterial infections.","Yanagawa, Youichi; Ogura, Masatsune; Fujimoto, Eita; Shono, Satoshi; Okuda, Eriya",Current Therapeutic Research,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4052969?pdf=render,196
1937,Nutritional Impact of Dietary Plasma Proteins in Animals Undergoing Experimental Challenge and Implications for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disorders: A Meta-analysis(1)(2),2015-09-01,"Studies administering plasma protein isolates (PPIs) to experimentally challenged animals have reported improvements in growth, food intake, and overall condition when compared with animals fed control diets, due in part to improvements in gut barrier function, normalization of cytokine signals, and support of enteric immune function. These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords. Twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13 experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The meta-analysis included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1 and 2 and at the end of study. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α were significantly lower in animals fed dietary PPIs. Additional research in patients experiencing symptoms of enteropathy will further characterize the benefits of PPIs in clinical populations.","Kuchibhatla, Ramana; Petschow, Bryon W; Odle, Jack; Weaver, Eric M",Advances in Nutrition,https://academic.oup.com/advances/article-pdf/6/5/541/23739125/an007930.pdf,196
3660,Respiratory mechanics in infants with severe bronchiolitis on controlled mechanical ventilation,2017-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of respiratory mechanics during mechanical ventilation (MV) is able to estimate resistive, elastic and inertial components of the working pressure of the respiratory system. Our aim was to discriminate the components of the working pressure of the respiratory system in infants on MV with severe bronchiolitis admitted to two PICU’s. METHODS: Infants younger than 1 year old with acute respiratory failure caused by severe bronchiolitis underwent neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation and volume controlled MV. Shortly after intubation studies of pulmonary mechanics were performed using inspiratory and expiratory breath hold. The maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow (QI and QE) as well as peak inspiratory (PIP), plateau (PPL) and total expiratory pressures (tPEEP) were measured. Inspiratory and expiratory resistances (RawI and RawE) and Time Constants (K(TI) and K(TE)) were calculated. RESULTS: We included 16 patients, of median age 2.5 (1–5.8) months. Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus was the main etiology (93.8%) and 31.3% had comorbidities. Measured respiratory pressures were PIP 29 (26–31), PPL 24 (20–26), tPEEP 9 [8–11] cmH2O. Elastic component of the working pressure was significantly higher than resistive and both higher than threshold (tPEEP – PEEP) (P < 0.01). QI was significantly lower than QE [5 (4.27–6.75) v/s 16.5 (12–23.8) L/min. RawI and RawE were 38.8 (32–53) and 40.5 (22–55) cmH2O/L/s; K(TI) and K(TE) [0.18 (0.12–0.30) v/s 0.18 (0.13–0.22) s], and K(TI):K(TE) ratio was 1:1.04 (1:0.59–1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of respiratory mechanics of infants with severe bronchiolitis receiving MV shows that the elastic component of the working pressure of the respiratory system is the most important. The elastic and resistive components in conjunction with flow profile are characteristic of restrictive diseases. A better understanding of lung mechanics in this group of patients may lead to change the traditional ventilatory approach to severe bronchiolitis.

4077,Epidemiological and clinical profile of Korean travelers receiving international medical repatriation,2019-09-27,"The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of medical transportation of Korean travelers who suffered accidents abroad and then transferred home by our aeromedical team. We collected demographic and clinical data on patients injured while traveling abroad from January 2013 to July 2017. Descriptive analyses based on 4 different transportation methods and transport time since hospitalization were performed. A total of 33 patients were repatriated during the study period. Of these, 28 (84.8%) were trauma cases with pedestrian injuries being the most common (11 cases; 39.3%). Twenty patients were repatriated by flight-stretchers, 6 by flight-prestige, 2 by ship, and 5 by air ambulance. The air ambulance was the most expensive (average 61,124 US Dollars) mode of transportation (P = .001) and the ship took the longest time (14 hours) to transport patients back to Korea from regions with similar distance (P = .0023). We experienced medical repatriation of 33 seriously injured Korean travelers back to South Korea. Transfer time should be an important considering factor and directly contacting and communicating with the specialized staff of foreign hospitals could also be very important to reduce unnecessary overseas hospital stay and cost incidence.","Kim, Jiena; Choi, Hyo Jeong; Kim, Ho Jung",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775375/,196
6016,Incidence and clinical characteristics of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders: report from a single center,2000,"Since the discovery of the extra-cellular lining material of the lung and the possibility harvesting this source by endobronchial lavage this material has been the object of many studies directed to analyze its components, function and possible change in the diseased lung. The best known component of the extra-cellular lining material is the phospholipid and its fatty acid composition. But also on the cellular material much emphasis has been taken with the aim using its cytology as diagnostic parameter. However, very few informations were obtained about the protein material also washed out during the endobronchial lavage. As it was demonstrated by immunological methods the proteins of the extra-cellular lining material consist of serum identical proteins and those being obviously specific for the lung tissue. As found, most serum identical proteins occure in the same amounts as found in the blood serum, and the molecular weight in general range up to 160,000 daltons indicating that there must be a restriction in passage of high molecular weight proteins through the lumen walls of the endothelium. Some proteins, IgG, IgA, do occure in a higher level in the extra-cellular lining material leading to the suggestion that these proteins were synthesized and secreted by the lung tissue itself. — The molecular weight of the lung specific proteins range from 16,000–340,000 daltons. Under reducing conditions however, for all species listed, two classes of subunits −36,000 and 12,000 daltons — result, indicating that these proteins might have comparable functions in the different species. The exact function of these specific proteins as well as the serum identical proteins till now is not known. One can only speculate that the serum identical proteins will have the same function in plasma and the lung, and that the specific proteins are involved in the formation in the surfactant system. Different amounts of lung specific proteins in lavage of disease lungs suggest that their estimation might be an additional useful parameter in diagnosis of lung diseases.","Müller, B.; von Wichert, P.",Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095849/,196

10562,Effect of mechanical ventilation versus spontaneous breathing on abdominal edema and inflammation in ARDS: an experimental porcine model,2020-04-25,SUMMARY: Hemagglutination (HA) test and electron microscopy (EM) were used to diagnose canine parvoviral enteritis on fecal samples from 58 hospitalized dogs of a huge epidemic. By HA‐tests the presence of the canine parvovirus (CPV) involved was shown in samples from 15 dogs (∼ 26%). A reference antiserum was used to identify the virus of each sample by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). By EM parvovirus‐like particles were seen in samples from 28 dogs (∼ 48%). Particles in six samples were identified as CPV by immunoaggregation. Sera from 17 out of 19 dogs examined showed specific HI titers during the acute stage of illness. A high incidence of concomitant infection with Campylobacter spp was found by the bacteriologists. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Diagnostische Erfahrungen während einer Epidemie von Parvovirus‐Enteritis der Hunde Während einer grossen Epidemie von Parvovirus‐Enteritis der Hunde (in Schweden) wurde der Nachweis von Virus in Kotproben mit Hilfe der Hëmagglutination (HA) und Elektronenmikroskopie (EM) versucht; die Kotproben stammten von 58 hospitalisierten Hunden. Mit dem HA‐Test ließ sich das ursächliche Parvovirus in den Proben von 15 Hunden nachweisen (= ∼ 26%). In jeder von diesen Proben wurde das Virus durch Hämagglutination‐Hemmung (HAH) mit einem Referenzserum identifiziert. Mit der EM waren Parvovirus‐ähnliche Partikel in den Proben von 28 Hunden zu finden (= ∼ 48%). In 6 von diesen Proben wurden die Partikel mittels der Immunaggregation als das ursächlichen Parvovirus identifiziert. In 17 Serumproben von 19 untersuchten Hunden wurden spezifische HAH‐Titer während der akuten Krankheitsphase festgestellt. Die Bakteriologen wiesen ein gehäuftes Vorkommen von gleichzeitiger Infektion mit Campylobacter spp nach.

11461,Incidence and complications of cannula changes in long-term tracheotomized patients: a prospective observational study,2019-07-16,"Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has never been applied in patients recovering from acute brain injury (ABI) because neural respiratory drive could be affected by intracranial disease with detrimental effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity. Our primary aim was to assess the impact of NAVA and pressure support ventilation (PSV) on CBF velocity. In fifteen adult patients recovering from ABI and undergoing invasive assisted ventilation, PSV and NAVA were applied over 30-min-lasting trials, in the following sequence: PSV(1), NAVA, and PSV(2). While PSV was set to deliver a tidal volume ranging between 6 and 8 ml kg(−1) of predicted body weight, in NAVA the level of assistance was chosen to achieve the same inspiratory peak airway pressure as PSV. At the end of each trial, a sonographic evaluation of CBF mean velocity was bilaterally obtained on the middle cerebral artery and an arterial blood gas sample was taken for analysis. CBF mean velocity was 51.8 [41.9,75.2] cm s(−1) at baseline, 51.9 [43.4,71.0] cm s(−1) in PSV(1), 53.6 [40.7,67.7] cm s(−1) in NAVA, and 49.5 [42.1,70.8] cm s(−1) in PSV(2) (p = 0.0514) on the left and 50.2 [38.0,77.7] cm s(−1) at baseline, 47.8 [41.7,68.2] cm s(−1) in PSV(1), 53.9 [40.1,78.5] cm s(−1) in NAVA, and 55.6 [35.9,74.1] cm s(−1) in PSV(2) (p = 0.8240) on the right side. No differences were detected for pH (p = 0.0551), arterial carbon dioxide tension (p = 0.8142), and oxygenation (p = 0.0928) over the entire study duration.

This study was performed to explore the relationship between the qPCR findings, clinical symptoms, and inflammatory markers in children with MPP. Four hundred children with MPP have been enrolled in this retrospective analysis. All clinical and analytical information, including mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) PCR results, has been collected. Based on the PCR results, the patients were divided into groups with load values (copy number) < 10(5) (54 cases), ≥10(5) and <10(6) (71 cases), ≥10(6) and <10(7) (112 cases), ≥10(7) and ≤10(8) (114 cases), and >10(8) (49 cases). The clinical features (including symptoms and signs) and inflammatory indicators were compared among the groups. The incidence of high fever (above 39°C), thermal peak during the entire hospitalization period, fever duration, days of hospitalization, and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were statistically correlated with the MP PCR load value in children with MPP. The analysis of relevance degree showed the correlative order as a thermal peak of hospitalization > duration of fever > period of hospitalization > LDH value > C-reactive protein value. The host immune response was significantly greater in the complication group than in the non-complication group.","Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Qiao; Du, Jie-lin; Deng, Dan; Gao, Ye-lei; Wang, Cheng-lin; Zhao, Hong-jie; Guo, Qian; Fu, Zhou; Tian, Dai-yin",Curr Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7595045/,196

OBJECTIVES: Determine if serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin (OH)D concentrations are lower in shelter dogs and if 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with clinical signs of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) or with time in the shelter. ANIMALS: One hundred forty‐six shelter dogs (clinically ill n = 36, apparently healthy n = 110) and 23 nonshelter control dogs. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Shelter dogs were grouped as clinically ill or apparently healthy based on the presence or absence, respectively, of clinical signs associated with CIRDC. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured with a competitive chemiluminesence immunoassay. Nucleic acids of agents associated with the CIRDC were amplified by polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The concentration of 25(OH)D was 7.3 ng/mL (4.5‐9.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]) lower in dogs with signs of CIRDC than apparently healthy shelter dogs (t(142) = 2.0, P = .04).

15356,Protocol for an observational study to identify potential predictors of an acute exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (the PACE Study),2021-02-08,"INTRODUCTION: Schema therapy (ST) is an efficacious psychotherapy for personality disorders (PDs) in adults. The first empirical support for the effectiveness of ST in older adults with cluster C PDs was provided recently. ST partly focusses on the positive, but there is an increasing awareness of imbalance in the ST community because of the emphasis on negative schemas versus attention to positive schemas. Positive schemas may be important vehicles of therapeutic change in psychotherapy with older people, as it may help strengthen the healthy adult mode, and it might also help change a negative life review. Suggestions were made to increase the efficacy and feasibility of ST in older adults, including adjusting the case conceptualisation, modifying the experiential techniques, making use of the patient's wisdom and reactivating positive schemas. The aim of the current study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of adapted individual ST for older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: A multiple baseline design is used with positive and negative core beliefs as primary outcome measures. Ten older adults (age > 60 years) with cluster C PDs are treated with schema therapy, with weekly sessions during one year. This treatment phase is preceded by a baseline phase varying randomly from 4 to 8 weeks. After treatment, there is a 6-month follow-up phase with monthly booster sessions. Symptomatic distress, schema modes, early maladaptive schemas (EMS) and early adaptive schemas (EAS) are secondary outcome measures. PD will be diagnosed before baseline and after treatment phase. EAS are assessed with the Dutch version of the Young Positive Schema Questionnaire (YPSQ). DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study in which positive schemas are integrated in ST treatment to examine the efficacy of an adapted form of ST for older adults. This is in line with wider developments supporting the integration of positive schema's into ST. It offers the possibility to improve the effectiveness of ST in older adults.

Directed evolution, which subjects a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection and amplification, is useful for protein engineering. In vivo continuous mutagenesis, which continuously diversifies target genes in the host cell, is a promising tool for accelerating directed evolution. However, combining in vivo continuous evolution and YSD is difficult because mutations in the gene encoding the anchor proteins may inhibit the display of target proteins on the cell surface. In this study, we have developed a modified YSD method that utilises SpyTag/SpyCatcher-based in vivo protein ligation. A nanobody fused with a SpyTag of 16 amino acids and an anchor protein fused with a SpyCatcher of 113 amino acids are encoded by separate gene cassettes and then assembled via isopeptide bond formation. This system achieved a high display efficiency of more than 90%, no intercellular protein ligation events, and the enrichment of target cells by cell sorting. These results suggested that our system demonstrates comparable performance with conventional YSD methods; therefore, it can be an appropriate platform to be integrated with in vivo continuous evolution.","Kajiwara, Kaho; Aoki, Wataru; Koike, Naoki; Ueda, Mitsuyoshi",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155107/,196

METHODS: We used the GEO2R tool to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE-related datasets retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition, we also identified the biological functions of the DEGs by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Additionally, we constructed protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify hub genes, as well as the regulatory network of transcription factors related to DEGs. RESULTS: Two datasets were identified for use from the GEO (GSE50772, GSE4588), and 34 up-regulated genes and 4 down-regulated genes were identified by GEO2R. Pathway analysis of the DEGs revealed enrichment of the interferon alpha/beta signaling pathway; GO analysis was mainly enriched in response to interferon alpha, regulation of ribonuclease activity. PPIs were constructed through the STRING database and 14 hub genes were selected and 1 significant module (score = 12.923) was obtained from the PPI network. Additionally, 11 key transcription factors that interacted closely with the 14 hub DEGs were identified from the gene transcription factor network. CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatic analysis is an effective tool for screening the original genomic data in the GEO database, and a large number of SLE-related DEGs were identified. The identified hub DEGs may be potential biomarkers of SLE.","Wang, Yanfeng; Ma, Qian; Huo, Zhenghao",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238284/,196
19157,"Nutritional-Related Predictors of Preterm Birth in North Shewa Hospitals, Central Ethiopia: A Case–Control Study",2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: To explore the effect of applying a comprehensive unit-based safety program (CUSP) in the intrahospital transfer of patients with critical diseases. METHODS: A total of 426 critically ill patients in the first affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from August 2018 to February 2019 were divided into two groups according to the time of admission. Overall, 202 patients in the control group were treated with the routine transfer method, and 224 patients in the observational group were treated with the transfer method based on the CUSP model. The safety culture assessment data of medical staff, the occurrence rate of adverse events and related causes, the time of transfer, and the satisfaction of patients’ relatives to the transfer process were compared before and after implementation of the transfer model between the two groups. RESULTS: Before and after the implementation of the CUSP mode transfer program, there were significant differences in the scores of all dimensions of the safety culture assessment of medical staff (P < 0.05), and the occurrence rate of adverse events and the causes in the observational group were significantly lower than those in the control group (disease-related, staff-related, equipment-related, environment-related) (P < 0.05). The transfer time for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), operating room, and the interventional room was significantly shorter in the observational group than that in the control group (P < 0.05), while the satisfaction of relatives to the transfer process was significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The implementation of CUSP model for the intrahospital transfer of critically ill patients can significantly shorten the in-hospital transfer time, improve the attitude of medical staff towards safety, reduce the occurrence rate of adverse events, and improve the satisfaction of patients’ relatives to the transfer process.

To improve the quality of diagnostic codes, this work extracts diagnostic codes from free-text notes: five old and new word vectorization methods were used to vectorize Stanford progress notes and predict eight ICD-10 codes of common cardiovascular diseases with logistic regression. The models showed good performance, with TF-IDF as the best vectorization model showing the highest AUROC (0.9499–0.9915) and AUPRC (0.2956–0.8072). The models also showed transferability when tested on MIMIC-III data with AUROC from 0.7952 to 0.9790 and AUPRC from 0.2353 to 0.8084. Model interpretability was shown by the important words with clinical meanings matching each disease.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the Spanish version of the Positive-Negative Emotional Eating Scale (PNEES) in a Spanish community sample. The sample consisted of 628 participants. The mean age was 27.5 (SD = 12.7) and 70.1% of them were women. The participants completed the PNEES, and measures of anxiety and depression (HADS), and eating disorder-related scales (TFEQ-R18, BULIT-R, and EAT-26) that were selected to examine convergent validity. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, replicating the original two-factor solution, consisting of Negative Emotional Eating (PNEES-N) and Positive Emotional Eating (PNEES-P). The results showed an acceptable fit of the model (CFI = 0.986; TLI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.055). Internal consistency ranged from ω = 0.92 to ω = 0.96 for both subscales and the total score. PNEES-P correlations with other variables were lower with respect to the PNEES-N, showing that they are different constructs. A mediation analysis was conducted, in which PNEES-P significantly predicted binge eating and PNEES-N was a partially mediator variable. The results showed that the adaptation process was successful.","Manchón, Javier; Quiles, María José; Quiles, Yolanda; López-Roig, Sofía",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287204/,196

A growing volume of healthcare data has been the hallmark of this digital transformation. The large healthcare datasets' complexity and their dynamic nature pose various challenges related to processing, analysis, storage, security, privacy, data exchange, and usability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess technological progress in EHR and PHR systems. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for systematic literature reviews on technological advancements that support EHR and PHR systems published between January 1, 2010, and October 06, 2020. RESULTS: The searches resulted in a total of 2,448 hits. Of these, we finally selected 23 systematic reviews. Most of the included papers dealt with information extraction tools and natural language processing technology (n = 10), followed by studies that assessed the use of blockchain technology in healthcare (n = 8). Other areas of digital technology research included EHR and PHR systems in austere settings (n = 1), de-identification methods (n = 1), visualization techniques (n = 1), communication tools within EHR and PHR systems (n = 1), and methodologies for defining Clinical Information Models that promoted EHRs and PHRs interoperability (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements can improve the efficiency in the implementation of EHR and PHR systems in numerous ways. Natural language processing techniques, either rule-based, machine-learning, or deep learning-based, can extract information from clinical narratives and other unstructured data locked in EHRs and PHRs, allowing secondary research (i.e., phenotyping). Moreover, EHRs and PHRs are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the blockchain technology implementation on Health Information Systems. Governance regulations, lack of trust, poor scalability, security, privacy, low performance, and high cost remain the most critical challenges for implementing these technologies.","Negro-Calduch, Elsa; Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha; Krishnamurthy, Ramesh S.; Novillo-Ortiz, David",Int J Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223493/,196

20050,Factors associated with engagement and adherence to a low-energy diet to promote 10% weight loss in patients with clinically significant non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,2021-07-29,"PD-1 blockade unleashes CD8 T cells(1), including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumour microenvironment can inhibit these T cell responses. Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens(2), and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay(3) in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a ‘barcode’ to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and Epstein–Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIT(high) TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation. These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.","Caushi, Justina X.; Zhang, Jiajia; Ji, Zhicheng; Vaghasia, Ajay; Zhang, Boyang; Hsiue, Emily Han-Chung; Mog, Brian J.; Hou, Wenpin; Justesen, Sune; Blosser, Richard; Tam, Ada; Anagnostou, Valsamo; Cottrell, Tricia R.; Guo, Haidan; Chan, Hok Yee; Singh, Dipika; Thapa, Sampriti; Dykema, Arbor G.; Burman, Poromendro; Choudhury, Begum; Aparicio, Luis; Cheung, Laurene S.; Lanis, Mara; Belcaid, Zineb; El Asmar, Margueritta; Illei, Peter B.; Wang, Rulin; Meyers, Jennifer; Schuebel, Kornel; Gupta, Anuj; Skaist, Alyza; Wheelan, Sarah; Naidoo, Jarushka; Marrone, Kristen A.; Brock, Malcolm; Ha, Jinny; Bush, Errol L.; Park, Bernard J.; Bott, Matthew; Jones, David R.; Reuss, Joshua E.; Velculescu, Victor E.; Chaft, Jamie E.; Kinzler, Kenneth W.; Zhou, Shibin; Vogelstein, Bert; Taube, Janis M.; Hellmann, Matthew D.; Brahmer, Julie R.; Merghoub, Taha; Forde, Patrick M.; Yegnasubramanian, Srinivasan; Ji, Hongkai; Pardoll, Drew M.; Smith, Kellie N.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8338555/,196

However, multi-modal integrative medicine including alternative/complementary treatments is becoming more widely used and integrated into treatment guidelines around the world. The uptake of this approach varies according to country, with generally a higher uptake in developed countries and in females aged more than 40 years. Integral to the concept described here, is that the body has an innate ability to self-heal, which can be optimized by the use of integrative medical strategies. Stress triggers for acute or recurring musculoskeletal pain are diverse and can range from physical to psychological. The mechanism by which the body responds to triggers and initiates the self-healing processes is complex, but five body networks or processes are thought to be integral: the nervous system, microcirculation/vasodilation, immune modulation, muscular relaxation/contraction and psychological balance. Multi-modal integrative medicine approaches include nutritional/dietary modification, postural/muscular training exercises, and cognitive behavioral mind/body techniques. This article will review the self-healing concept and provide plausible scientific evidence where available.","McSwan, Joyce; Gudin, Jeffrey; Song, Xue-Jun; Grinberg Plapler, Perola; Betteridge, Neil John; Kechemir, Hayet; Igracki-Turudic, Iva; Pickering, Gisele",J Pain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8464648/,196

24182,Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage,2019-07-24,"Organizing pneumonia is a particular type of inflammatory and reparative reaction of the lung parenchyma characterized by fibroblast proliferation in the distal airspaces with overall preservation of the lung architecture. When microscopic, it is an asymptomatic and nonspecific reaction of little clinical significance accompanying many pathological processes. When macroscopic and affecting large portions of the lung parenchyma, it manifests by restrictive ventilatory defect and gas exchange impairment leading to dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia, alveolar opacities at chest imaging, and symptoms of systemic inflammation such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. This picture constitutes the clinico-pathological syndrome of organizing pneumonia, which has been recognized and characterized as a distinct entity in the past 30 years. Although the classical features of organizing pneumonia are increasingly familiar to chest physicians, and the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment makes it appear at first sight as an easy problem to resolve, atypical clinical presentations, similarities with other diseases, severe forms, histological variants, side effects of therapy, and relapses can make the management more difficult than initially expected. This chapter will address the classical and less common features of organizing pneumonia, and will provide practical clues to the diagnosis and management of this disorder.","Lazor, Romain",Orphan Lung Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120422/,196

Biological networks are typical complex networks with widely real-world applications. Many problems arising in biological systems can be boiled down to the identification of important nodes. For example, biomedical researchers frequently need to identify important genes that potentially leaded to disease phenotypes in animal and explore crucial genes that were responsible for stress responsiveness in plants. To facilitate the identification of important nodes in biological systems, one needs to know network structures or behavioral data of nodes (such as gene expression data). If network topology was known, various centrality measures can be developed to solve the problem; while if only behavioral data of nodes were given, some sophisticated statistical methods can be employed. This paper reviewed some of the recent works on statistical identification of important nodes in biological systems from three aspects, that is, 1) in general complex networks based on complex networks theory and epidemic dynamic models; 2) in biological networks based on network motifs; and 3) in plants based on RNA-seq data. The identification of important nodes in a complex system can be seen as a mapping from the system to the ranking score vector of nodes, such mapping is not necessarily with explicit form. The three aspects reflected three typical approaches on ranking nodes in biological systems and can be integrated into one general framework. This paper also proposed some challenges and future works on the related topics. The associated investigations have potential real-world applications in the control of biological systems, network medicine and new variety cultivation of crops.","Wang, Pei",J Syst Sci Complex,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801784/,196

Recent studies shows that ApoE e4 genotype is associated with both dementia and delirium(2). Hence further research into the possible genetic link between dementia and COVID‐19 is the need of the hour. METHOD: We studied two elderly male patients, aged 66 and 68 years, presenting with memory decline of recent events, untimely and non‐sequential Activities of Daily Living and apathetic alongwith way finding difficulty and errors in money transactions. One patient also had forgetfulness of handwashing and face hygiene measures, and of using preventive face masks in public places as advised for public health during COVID‐19 outbreak. On examination, vitals were stable and normal fundus examination with no fever, dry cough or tiredness, and no evidence of Increased Intracranial Pressure(ICP). MMSE score was 16/30 and 17/30 respectively, recent memory and visuospatial skills were impaired and slowness of activities were present. Motor examination was normal, with no focal or non‐focal neurological deficit or sensory impairment. All routine tests were normal. Neuroimaging with contrast in one patient showed well defined hyperdense mass lesion of size 4.0*3.5*3.0 cms. showing heterogenous contrast enhancement in left parieto‐occipital lobes with moderate perilesional edema suggestive of astrocytoma (intermediate type). RESULT: High index of suspicion of Space occupying lesions should be made in the background of RPD even in the absence of focal or non focal neurological deficit or without signs of raised ICP. CONCLUSION: Most of the etiologies causing RPD especially surgical causes, if diagnosed early and promptly are reversible and treatable.

Therefore, methods working with less annotation effort are of special interest. This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised semantic segmentation, that is only a small subset of the training images is annotated. In order to leverage the information present in the unlabeled images, we propose to learn a second task that is related to semantic segmentation but that is easier to learn and requires less annotated images. For the second task, we learn latent classes that are on one hand easy enough to be learned from the small set of labeled data and are on the other hand as consistent as possible with the semantic classes. While the latent classes are learned on the labeled data, the branch for inferring latent classes provides on the unlabeled data an additional supervision signal for the branch for semantic segmentation. In our experiments, we show that the latent classes boost the accuracy for semi-supervised semantic segmentation and that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets.

Annual panel data from 1996 to 2018 are examined using the Pedroni panel cointegration test in order to check the existence of a long-run relationship; FMOLS, DOLS, and the VECM techniques to detect the causality direction. The following findings are established. First, in the long run, infectious diseases are more destructive on economic growth in developing countries than in developed countries. Second, infectious diseases have a negative and significant influence on the trade openness, but more intensively in developed countries than in developing countries. Finally, using the VEC model, our results demonstrate that the short run causality between diseases, economic growth, and trade openness is unidirectional running from infectious diseases to trade and economic growth. However, in the long run, there is bidirectional Granger causality among the running variables. Based on these results, government makers should concentrate more on the healthcare delivery in order to realize higher rates of economic growth and trade.","Ismahene, Yahyaoui",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294222/,196

Understanding costs is important to budget for service delivery, but costs evidence for environmental health services (EHS) in healthcare facilities (HCFs) is lacking. We present the first systematic review to evaluate the costs of establishing, operating, and maintaining EHS in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We systematically searched for studies costing water, sanitation, hygiene, cleaning, waste management, personal protective equipment, vector control, laundry, and lighting in LMICs. Our search yielded 36 studies that reported costs for 51 EHS. There were 3 studies that reported costs for water, 3 for sanitation, 4 for hygiene, 13 for waste management, 16 for cleaning, 2 for personal protective equipment, 10 for laundry, and none for lighting or vector control. Quality of evidence was low. Reported costs were rarely representative of the total costs of EHS provision. Unit costs were infrequently reported. This review identifies opportunities to improve costing research through efforts to categorize and disaggregate EHS costs, greater dissemination of existing unpublished data, improvements to indicators to monitor EHS demand and quality necessary to contextualize costs, and development of frameworks to define EHS needs and essential inputs to guide future costing.","Anderson, Darcy M; Cronk, Ryan; Fejfar, Donald; Pak, Emily; Cawley, Michelle; Bartram, Jamie",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477905/,196

Yet contact tracing is among the most powerful. Contact tracing is the process by which public-health officials identify people, or contacts, who have been exposed to a person infected with a pathogen or another hazard. For all its power, though, contact tracing yields a variable level of success. One reason is that contact tracing's ability to break the chain of transmission is only as effective as the proportion of contacts who are actually traced. In part, this proportion turns on the quality of the information that infected people provide, which makes human memory a crucial part of the efficacy of contact tracing. Yet the fallibilities of memory, and the challenges associated with gathering reliable information from memory, have been grossly underestimated by those charged with gathering it. We review the research on witnesses and investigative interviewing, identifying interrelated challenges that parallel those in contact tracing, as well as approaches for addressing those challenges.","Garry, Maryanne; Hope, Lorraine; Zajac, Rachel; Verrall, Ayesha J; Robertson, Jamie M",Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620978205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301692/,196
61736,Progression of kidney injury and cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats: the role of renal sympathetic innervation.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE A variety of deconstructive and reconstructive therapies have been used to treat intracranial aneurysms. The Pipeline embolization device (PED) has become a quite successful option to treat aneurysms, while reconstructing and remodeling the parent vessel. We report a case of off-label PED use, where a flow diverter was placed across the parent vessel of a giant intracranial aneurysm in a novel deconstructive strategy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 40-year-old man with a giant, slow-flow aneurysm of the distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) was treated with the placement of a PED across the vessel containing the aneurysm after superselective test balloon occlusion of that vessel failed. PED was successfully deployed in a competing MCA branch across the origin of the MCA branch supplying the giant aneurysm. The patient continued dual-antiplatelet therapy for 5 months and aspirin monotherapy thereafter. Follow-up angiography, performed 6 months after treatment, demonstrated complete and asymptomatic thrombosis of the aneurysm and its parent MCA branch. A collateral pial and leptomeningeal network developed, reconstructing the distal branches of the occluded MCA branch. After 18 months, the patient remains neurologically intact. CONCLUSION This appears to be the first description of progressive deconstruction for aneurysm treatment by using PED. Despite not tolerating acute vessel occlusion with superselective test balloon occlusion, the patient was asymptomatic following long-term occlusion with PED secondary to the growth of pial and leptomeningeal collateral networks.","Wajnberg, Eduardo; Silva, Thiago S; Johnson, Andrew K; Lopes, Demetrius K",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23787883/,196

The current study reports on the status of COVID-19 infections in patients presenting for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on circuit complications. A tracking process for monitoring the presence of COVID-19 in adult cardiac surgery patients was integrated into a case documentation system across United States hospitals where out-sourced perfusion services were provided. Assessment included infection status, testing technique employed, surgery status and CPB complications. Records from 5612 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery between November 1, 2020 and January 18, 2021 from 176 hospitals were reviewed. A sub-cohort of coronary artery bypass graft patients (3283) was compared using a mixed effect binary logistic regression analysis. 4297 patients had negative test results (76.6%) while 49 (0.9%) tested positive for COVID-19, and unknown or no results were reported in 693 (12.4%) and 573 (10.2%) respectively. Coagulation complications were reported at 0.2% in the negative test results group versus 4.1% in the positive test result group (p < 0.001). Oxygenator gas exchange complications were 0.2% in the negative test results group versus 2.0% in the positive test results group (p = 0.088). Coronary artery bypass graft patients with a positive test had significantly higher risk for any CPB complication (p = 0.003) [OR 10.38, CI 2.18-49.53] then negative test patients [OR 0.01, CI 0.00-0.20]. The present study has shown that patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB who test positive for COVID-19 have higher CPB complication rate than those who test negative.","Stammers, Alfred H; Mongero, Linda B; Tesdahl, Eric A; Patel, Kirti P; Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Firstenberg, Michael S; Petersen, Courtney; Barletti, Shannon; Gibbs, Autumn",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591211018983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041981/,196
62281,Severe maternal morbidity in preterm cesarean delivery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND Mechanical ventilation is one of the most important therapeutic interventions in neonatal and pediatric ICUs. Telemedicine has been shown to reliably extend pediatric intensivist expertise to facilities where expertise is limited. If reliable, telemedicine may extend the reach of pediatric respiratory therapists (RTs) to facilities where expertise does not exist or free up existing RT resources for important face-to-face activities in facilities where expertise is limited. The aim of this study was to determine how well respiratory assessments for ventilated neonates and children correlated when performed simultaneously by 2 RTs face-to-face and via telemedicine. METHODS We conducted a pilot study including 40 assessments by 16 RTs on 11 subjects (5 neonatal ICU; 6 pediatric ICU). Anonymously completed intake forms by 2 different RTs concurrently assessing 14 ventilator-derived and patient-based respiratory variables were used to determine correlations. RESULTS Forty paired assessments were performed. Median telemedicine assessment time was 8 min. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine agreement between continuous data, and the Cohen kappa statistics were used for binary variables. Pressure control, PEEP, breathing frequency, and FIO2 perfectly correlated (r = 1, all P < .001) as did the presence of a CO2 monitor and need for increased ventilatory support (kappa = 1). The Pearson correlation coefficient for VT, minute ventilation, mean airway pressure, and oxygen saturation ranged from 0.84 to 0.97 (all P < .001). kappa = 0.41 (95% CI 0.02-0.80) for patient-triggered breaths, and kappa = 0.57 (95% CI 0.19-0.94) for breathing frequency higher than set frequency. kappa = -0.25 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.04) for need for suctioning. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine technology was acceptable to RTs. Telemedicine evaluations highly correlated with face-to-face for 10 of 14 aspects of standard bedside respiratory assessment. Poor correlation was noted for more complex, patient-generated parameters, highlighting the importance of further investigation incorporating a virtual stethoscope.","Bell, Rebecca C; Yager, Phoebe H; Clark, Maureen E; Roumiantsev, Serguei; Venancio, Heather L; Chipman, Daniel W; Kacmarek, Robert M; Noviski, Natan N",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26647456/,196
62477,Response to: 'Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with SLE: results of a large multicentric survey from India' by Goyal et al.,2020-07-15,"Background: The optimal polymyxin B dosage needed to achieve an efficacy target of 50-100 mg·h/L when treating multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is unclear. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous polymyxin B were evaluated to better inform dosing. Methods: This was a prospective, observational pharmacokinetic (PK) study of nine CF adults receiving intravenous polymyxin B as part of usual clinical care. Doses preceding PK sampling ranged from 50-100 mg every 12 hours. Five PK samples were collected following the fourth or fifth dose and concentrations of polymyxin subcomponents, B1 and B2, were quantified using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Population PK (NONMEM® software) analysis was performed using pooled polymyxin B1+B2 concentrations. Results: Participants were Caucasian, predominantly male, with mean age and weight of 31 years (range 21-57 years) and 58.0kg (range 38.3-70.4kg), respectively. A 1-compartment zero-order infusion and linear elimination model adequately described the data with estimated clearance and volume of distribution, 2.09 L/hr and 12.7 L, respectively, corresponding to a 4.1 hour mean half-life (t1/2). Although body weight was observed to influence the volume of distribution, a fixed dose of 75 mg every 12 hours was predicted to achieve the target steady-state exposure. Neurotoxicities were reported in all patients; acute kidney injury events in two patients. These events resolved within 2-4 days after discontinuing polymyxin B. Conclusions: Fixed maintenance dosing of polymyxin B without loading is predicted to achieve the targeted therapeutic exposure in CF adults. Treatment-limiting neurotoxicities are very common in this population.","Crass, Ryan L; Al Naimi, Tamara; Wen, Bo; Souza, Ernane; Murray, Susan; Pai, Manjunath P; Jia, Shijing",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00792-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252297/,196

64628,Minimally invasive delivery of a novel direct epicardial assist device in a porcine heart failure model.,2014,"BACKGROUND Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that causes significant disability. However, the lack of evidence for functional decline yields difficulty in distinguishing patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. Since patients with schizophrenia demonstrate severe facial emotion recognition deficit (FERD), FERD measurement appears to be a promising solution for the aforementioned challenge.We aimed to develop a FERD-based screening tool to differentiates patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. METHODS Patients' responses were extracted from a previous study. The most discriminative index was determined by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of patients' FER scores in 7 domains individually and collectively. The best cut-off score was selected only for the most discriminative index to provide both high sensitivity and specificity (≥ 0.90). RESULTS The ""number of domains failed"" showed the highest discriminative value (AUC = 0.92). Since high sensitivity and specificity could not be achieved simultaneously, two sub-optimal cut-off scores were recommended for prospective users. For users prioritizing sensitivity, the ""≥ 2 domains failed"" index yields high sensitivity (0.96) with modest specificity (0.66). For users targeting specificity, the ""≥ 4 domains failed"" indexachieves high specificity (0.92) with acceptable sensitivity (0.72). LIMITATIONS Convenience sampling with mild clinical severity and younger healthy adults (< 20 years old) may limit the generalizability. CONCLUSION The FERD screener seems to be a discriminative tool with changeable cut-off scores achieving high sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, it may be useful in detecting patients and ruling out adults erroneously suspected of having schizophrenia.","Lee, Shih-Chieh; Liu, Chen-Chung; Kuo, Chian-Jue; Hsueh, I-Ping; Hsieh, Ching-Lin",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734912/,196

However, they are associated with the occurrence of immune-related adverse events. Despite their low incidence, renal complications can interfere with the oncologic strategy. The breaking of peripheral tolerance and the emergence of auto- or drug-reactive T-cells are the main pathophysiological hypotheses to explain renal complications after ICI exposure. ICIs can induce a large spectrum of renal symptoms with variable severity (from isolated electrolyte disorders to dialysis-dependent acute kidney injury (AKI)) and presentation (acute tubule-interstitial nephritis in >90% of cases and a minority of glomerular diseases). In this review, the current trends in diagnosis and treatment strategies are summarized. The diagnosis of ICI-related renal complications requires special steps to avoid confounding factors, identify known risk factors (lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, proton pump inhibitor use, and combination ICI therapy), and prove ICI causality, even after long-term exposure (weeks to months). A kidney biopsy should be performed as soon as possible. The treatment strategies rely on ICI discontinuation as well as co-medications, corticosteroids for 2 months, and tailored immunosuppressive drugs when renal response is not achieved.","Belliere, Julie; Mazieres, Julien; Meyer, Nicolas; Chebane, Leila; Despas, Fabien",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11071187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208848/,196
70364,Exercise therapy for an older patient with left ventricular assist device.,2014,"PURPOSE Increased expression of αvβ3 integrins is involved in tumour angiogenesis. Targeting these receptors with a dedicated peptide containing the RGD sequence may provide information about the receptor status in and around the tumour and about the angiogenesis process involved. The aim of this study was to compare the uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD in two types of tumours that either express or do not express the αvβ3 receptor (NTERA-2 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) and discuss the use of this tracer in experimental models of angiogenesis. PROCEDURES Uptake of intravenously injected [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was studied ex vivo and in vivo. Histological analysis of excised tumours was carried out. Percentages of the injected dose uptake per gram of tissue were compared between the two types of tumours and in the periphery and centre of each tumour. RESULTS [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was rapidly cleared from blood circulation and excreted through the kidneys. Residual activity was retained in the intestine. Tumour uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was high and homogeneous for αvβ3-positive cell lines (1.94±0.26%ID/g). Tumour uptake was weak and distributed only in the tumour periphery for αvβ3-negative cell lines (0.10±0.02%ID/g, tumour periphery; 0.06±0.01%ID/g, tumour core; P=0.01). These results correlated with vessel distribution. CONCLUSION Uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was more intense in αvβ3-positive cell lines than in αvβ3-negative cell lines, but tracer distribution was more representative of angiogenic locations in αvβ3-negative cell lines. Further clinical and preclinical studies are needed on the use of RGD-related tracers.","Bohn, Pierre; Modzelewski, Romain; Rouvet, Jean; Briand, Mélanie; Dutoit, Soizic; Pille, Jean-Yves; Picquenot, Jean-Michel; Aide, Nicolas; Vera, Pierre",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0b013e328361f552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652209/,196

We present characteristics, interventions and longer-term outcomes of the entire, unselected cohort of all ICU patients with COVID-19 in Denmark where the ICU capacity was not exceeded. METHODS We identified all patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to any Danish ICU from March 10th to May 19th 2020 and registered demographics, chronic comorbidities, use of organ support, length of stay and vital status from patient files. Risk factors for death were analyzed by adjusted Cox regression analysis. RESULTS There were 323 ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19. Median age was 68 years, 74% were men, 50% had hypertension, 21% diabetes, and 20% chronic pulmonary disease; 29% had no chronic comorbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 82%, vasopressors in 83%, renal replacement therapy in 26% and ECMO in 8%. ICU stay was median 13 days (IQR 6-22) and hospital stay 19 days (11-30).

According to capacity-sharing accounts of multitasking, assuming a general pool of resources two tasks can draw upon, predictability should reduce the need for resources and allow more resources to be used by the other task. However, it is currently not well understood what drives resource-allocation policy in dual tasks and which resource allocation policies participants pursue. We used a continuous tracking task together with an audiomotor task and manipulated advance visual information about the tracking path in the first experiment and a sound sequence in the second experiments (2a/b). Results show that performance predominantly improved in the predictable task but not in the unpredictable task, suggesting that participants did not invest more resources into the unpredictable task. One possible explanation was that the re-investment of resources into another task requires some relationship between the tasks. Therefore, in the third experiment, we covaried the two tasks by having sounds 250 ms before turning points in the tracking curve. This enabled participants to improve performance in both tasks, suggesting that resources were shared better between tasks.","Broeker, Laura; Ewolds, Harald; de Oliveira, Rita F; Künzell, Stefan; Raab, Markus",Cognitive research: principles and implications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00267-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398471/,196

77700,Surgical Infection Society Guidance for Restoration of Surgical Services during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 Pandemic.,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical and cosmetic results of transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy (TVC), single-port cholecystectomy (SPC), and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery have been developed as minimally invasive alternatives for CLC. Few comparative studies have been reported. METHODS Female patients with symptomatic gallstone disease who were treated in 2011 with SPC, TVC, or CLC were entered into a database. Patients were matched for age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgery. After the operation all patients received a survey with questions about recovery, cosmesis, and body image. RESULTS A total of 90 patients, 30 in each group, were evaluated. Median operative time for CLC was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). There were no major complications. Length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and postoperative complications were not significantly different. The results for cosmesis and body image after the transvaginal approach were significantly higher. None of the sexually active women observed postoperative dyspareunia. CONCLUSIONS Both SPC and TVC are feasible procedures when performed in selected patients. CLC is a faster procedure, but other clinical outcomes and complication rates were similar. SPC, and especially TVC, offer a better cosmetic result. Randomized trials are needed to specify the role of SPC and TVC in the treatment of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease.","van den Boezem, Peter B; Velthuis, Simone; Lourens, Harm J; Cuesta, Miguel A; Sietses, Colin",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-2221-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24081531/,196

METHODS We conducted active, household-based ARI surveillance among children aged <3 years in rural highland communities of San Marcos, Cajamarca, Peru from May 2009 through September 2011 (RESPIRA-PERU study). ARI (defined by fever or cough) were considered lower respiratory tract infections if tachypnea, wheezing, grunting, stridor or retractions were present. Nasal swabs collected during ARI episodes were tested for respiratory viruses by real-time, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. ARI incidence was calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS During 755.1 child-years of observation among 892 children in 58 communities, 4475 ARI were observed, yielding an adjusted incidence of 6.2 ARI/child-year (95% confidence interval: 5.9-6.5). Families sought medical care for 24% of ARI, 4% were classified as lower respiratory tract infections and 1% led to hospitalization. Of 5 deaths among cohort children, 2 were attributed to ARI. One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 67% of 3957 samples collected. Virus-specific incidence rates per 100 child-years were: rhinovirus, 236; adenovirus, 73; parainfluenza virus, 46; influenza, 37; respiratory syncytial virus, 30 and human metapneumovirus, 17. Respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus 1-3 comprised a disproportionate share of lower respiratory tract infections compared with other etiologies. CONCLUSIONS In this high-altitude rural setting with low-population density, ARI in young children were common, frequently severe and associated with a number of different respiratory viruses. Effective strategies for prevention and control of these infections are needed.","Budge, Philip J; Griffin, Marie R; Edwards, Kathryn M; Williams, John V; Verastegui, Hector; Hartinger, Stella M; Johnson, Monika; Klemenc, Jennifer M; Zhu, Yuwei; Gil, Ana I; Lanata, Claudio F; Grijalva, Carlos G",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24378948/,196

80779,Trials of implantable monitoring devices in heart failure: which design is optimal?,2014,"Purpose Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) selectively vasodilates the pulmonary circulation but the effects are sometimes insufficient. Available intravenous (iv) substances are non-selective and cause systemic side effects. The pulmonary and systemic effects of iNO and an iv mono-organic nitrite (PDNO) were compared in porcine models of acute pulmonary hypertension. Methods In anesthetized piglets, dose-response experiments of iv PDNO at normal pulmonary arterial pressure (n=10) were executed. Dose-response experiments of iv PDNO (n=6) and iNO (n=7) were performed during pharmacologically induced pulmonary hypertension (U46619 iv). The effects of iv PDNO and iNO were also explored in 5 mins of hypoxia-induced increase in pulmonary pressure (n=2-4). Results PDNO (15, 30, 45 and 60 nmol NO kg-1 min-1 iv) and iNO (5, 10, 20 and 40 ppm which corresponded to 56, 112, 227, 449 nmol NO kg-1 min-1, respectively) significantly decreased the U46619-increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to a similar degree without significant decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). iNO caused increased levels of methemoglobin. At an equivalent delivered NO quantity (iNO 5 ppm and PDNO 45 nmol kg-1 min-1 iv), PDNO decreased PVR and SVR significantly more than iNO. Both drugs counteracted hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and they decreased the ratio of PVR and SVR in both settings. Conclusion Intravenous PDNO was a more potent pulmonary vasodilator than iNO in pulmonary hypertension, with no severe side effects. Hence, this study supports the potential of iv PDNO in the treatment of acute pulmonary hypertension.","Stene Hurtsén, Anna; Zorikhin Nilsson, Ilya; Dogan, Emanuel M; Nilsson, Kristofer F","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s237477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109989/,196

82866,Impact of Institutional Volume on Outcomes of Catheter Directed Thrombolysis in the Treatment of Acute Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis: A 6-Year US Experience (2005-2010).,2015,"BACKGROUND Substantial health inequities exist for Indigenous Peoples in Canada. The remote and distributed population of Canada presents unique challenges for access to and use of surgery. To date, the surgical outcome data for Indigenous Peoples in Canada have not been synthesized. METHODS We searched 4 databases to identify studies comparing surgical outcomes and utilization rates of adults of First Nations, Inuit or Métis identity with non-Indigenous people in Canada. Independent reviewers completed all stages in duplicate. Our primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included utilization rates of surgical procedures, complications and hospital length of stay. We performed meta-analysis of the primary outcome using random effects models. We assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were reviewed involving 1 976 258 participants (10.2% Indigenous). No studies specifically addressed Inuit or Métis populations. Four studies, including 7 cohorts, contributed adjusted mortality data for 7135 participants (5.2% Indigenous); Indigenous Peoples had a 30% higher rate of death after surgery than non-Indigenous patients (pooled hazard ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.54; I 2 = 81%). Complications were also higher for Indigenous Peoples, including infectious complications (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.13-2.34) and pneumonia (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.58-3.19). Rates of various surgical procedures were lower, including rates of renal transplant, joint replacement, cardiac surgery and cesarean delivery. INTERPRETATION The currently available data on postoperative outcomes and surgery utilization rates for Indigenous Peoples in Canada are limited and of poor quality. Available data suggest that Indigenous Peoples have higher rates of death and adverse events after surgery, while also encountering barriers accessing surgical procedures. These findings suggest a need for substantial re-evaluation of surgical care for Indigenous Peoples in Canada to ensure equitable access and to improve outcomes.

Elective surgery was initially halted and acute non-deferrable surgical care drastically limited. The presence of COVID-19 patients into intensive care units (ICU) is currently decreasing but their congestion have restricted our therapeutic strategies during the last months. METHODS In the COVID-19 era eighteen patients (8 men, 10 women) with a mean age of 80 years, needing undelayable abdominal surgery underwent awake open surgery at our Department. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent COVID-19 investigation. In all cases locoregional anesthesia (LA) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain has been monitored and regularly assessed. A distinct pathway has been set up to keep patients of uncertain COVID-19 diagnosis separated from all other patients. RESULTS Mean operative time was 104 minutes. In only one case conversion to general anesthesia was necessary. Postoperative pain was always well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. Only one perioperative complication occurred. Early readmissions after surgery were never observed. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our experience awake laparotomy under LA resulted feasible, safe, painless and, in specific cases, the only viable option. For patients presenting fragile cardiovascular and respiratory, reserves and in whom general anesthesia (GA) would presumably increase morbidity and mortality we encourage LA as an alternative to GA. In the COVID-19 era, it has become part of our ICU-preserving strategy allowing us to carry out undeferrable surgeries.","Romanzi, Andrea; Moroni, Rossella; Rongoni, Erica; Scolaro, Roberta; La Regina, Davide; Mongelli, Francesco; Putortì, Antonella; Rossi, Fabrizio; Zanardo, Michel; Vannelli, Alberto",Minerva chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4733.20.08466-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210528/,196
82985,More evidences on which biologic and which pathway is key in severe-critical COVID-19 pneumonia.,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND Two commonly performed surgical interventions are available for severe (grade II-IV) haemorrhoids; traditional excisional surgery and stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Uncertainty exists as to which is most effective. The eTHoS trial was designed to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy compared with traditional excisional surgery. METHODS The eTHoS trial was a large, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial done in adult participants (aged 18 years or older) referred to hospital for surgical treatment for grade II-IV haemorrhoids. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either traditional excisional surgery or stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Randomisation was minimised according to baseline EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level score (EQ-5D-3L), haemorrhoid grade, sex, and centre with an automated system to stapled haemorrhoidopexy or traditional excisional surgery. The primary outcome was area under the quality of life curve (AUC) measured with the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system over 24 months, assessed according to the randomised groups. The primary outcome measure was analysed using linear regression with adjustment for the minimisation variables. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN80061723. FINDINGS Between Jan 13, 2011, and Aug 1, 2014, 777 patients were randomised (389 to receive stapled haemorrhoidopexy and 388 to receive traditional excisional surgery). Stapled haemorrhoidopexy was less painful than traditional excisional surgery in the short term and surgical complication rates were similar between groups. The EQ-5D-3L AUC score was higher in the traditional excisional surgery group than the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group over 24 months; mean difference -0·073 (95% CI -0·140 to -0·006; p=0·0342). EQ-5D-3L was higher for stapled haemorrhoidopexy in the first 6 weeks after surgery, the traditional excisional surgery group had significantly better quality of life scores than the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group. 24 (7%) of 338 participants who received stapled haemorrhoidopexy and 33 (9%) of 352 participants who received traditional excisional surgery had serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION As part of a tailored management plan for haemorrhoids, traditional excisional surgery should be considered over stapled haemorrhoidopexy as the surgical treatment of choice.

DESIGN Umbrella review, systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychINFO (Ovid), Medline (Ovid) and Wiley Cochrane Library up to April 2020. RESULTS Of 6225 results, 25 studies of non-smokers-never, not current and former smokers-with a baseline measure of e-cigarette use and an outcome measure of combustible smoking uptake were included. All 25 studies found increased risk of smoking uptake with e-cigarette exposure, although magnitude varied substantially. Using a random-effects model, comparing e-cigarette users versus non-e-cigarette users, among never-smokers at baseline the OR for smoking initiation was 3.25 (95% CI 2.61 to 4.05, I2 85.7%) and among non-smokers at baseline the OR for current smoking was 2.87 (95% CI 1.97 to 4.19, I2 90.1%). Among former smokers, smoking relapse was higher in e-cigarette users versus non-users (OR=2.40, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.83, I2 12.3%). CONCLUSIONS Across multiple settings, non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are consistently more likely than those avoiding e-cigarettes to initiate combustible cigarette smoking and become current smokers. The magnitude of this risk varied, with an average of around three times the odds. Former smokers using e-cigarettes have over twice the odds of relapse as non-e-cigarettes users. This study is the first to our knowledge to review and pool data on the latter topic.

84597,Shivering has little diagnostic value in diagnosing serious bacterial infection in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Multiple single-port or single-incision techniques have been successfully implemented for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adults and children. These techniques require either a large multichannel port or a larger skin incision to accommodate multiple ports or instruments. Inspired by a first generation single-port instrument, we developed a safe and effective technique for a single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy with virtually scarless results. METHODS Over a 14-mo period, 20 patients (19 females, 1 male) underwent the hybrid single-port cholecystectomy. A straight 10-mm Storz telescope with inbuilt 6-mm working channel in combination with 2 portless 2.3-mm percutaneous graspers was used. The dissection is carried out with 43-cm bariatric length instruments. The cystic artery and duct are sealed with WECK Hem-o-lok clips or the Harmonic scalpel. RESULTS Range (mean) age: 7.7 y to 19.5 y (15.5), BMI: 11.6kg/m(2) to 42.3kg/m(2) (27), operative duration 48 min to 120 min (79), postoperative length of stay: 5 h to 78 h (24). DIAGNOSIS 13 patients cholecystolithiasis, 7 patients biliary dyskinesia. Conversion to conventional 4-port cholecystectomy was required in 2 patients. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION The hybrid single-port technique is easy to master. It provides traditional anatomical exposure and allows application of conventional laparoscopic principles.","Seifarth, Federico G; Ramirez, José R; Magnuson, David K",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680812x13427982377148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23318065/,196

In addition, prevalence rates as high as 7% have been reported in blood donors, raising the risk of transfusion-related transmission. Several laboratories have utilized microneutralization assays as a surrogate marker for detection of anti-MLV serologic responses--with up to 25% of prostate cancer patients reported to harbor neutralizing antibody responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We developed a high-throughput microneutralization assay for research studies on blood donors using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with XMRV-specific envelopes. Infection with these pseudotypes was neutralized by sera from both macaques and mice challenged with XMRV, but not preimmune serum. A total of 354 plasma samples from blood donors in the Reno/Tahoe area were screened for neutralization. RESULTS A total of 6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed. CONCLUSION A microneutralization assay was developed for detection of XMRV and can be applied in a high-throughput format for large-scale studies. Although a proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV envelope-mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or MLV. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, nonspecific mechanism.","Zhou, Yanchen; Steffen, Imke; Montalvo, Leilani; Lee, Tzong-Hae; Zemel, Reeve; Switzer, William M; Tang, Shaohua; Jia, Hongwei; Heneine, Walid; Winkelman, Valerie; Tailor, Chetankumar S; Ikeda, Yasuhiro; Simmons, Graham",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03519.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22239212/,196

Typically, for pediatric thoracic surgery, a mainstem intubation or placement of an intraluminal bronchial blocker is sufficient for lung isolation. The patient whose case is reported here suffered from a pleuropulmonary blastoma compressing the left lower lobe bronchus and resultant chronic infection involving the left lower lobe. In this unusual situation, to isolate the chronic lung infection and to provide the needed adequate operative conditions, endobronchial intubation of the right, nonoperative lung and placement of an endobronchial blocker into the left lower lobe bronchus were performed.

To that aim, we estimate the threshold values of the key variables of the policy rule: the inflation gap and the output gap. The threshold model allows us to know which are the turning points from which the relationship between the key variables and the interest rate revert. In the Eurozone countries, we have found that the inflation gap always contributes to increasing the nominal interest rate. On the contrary, the output gap works differently when it reaches values above or below the threshold value, which would favour the reduction of the interest rates towards the zero level.","Diaz-Roldan, Carmen; Prats, María A; Ramos-Herrera, Maria Del Carmen",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048453/,196

FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) facilitates the progression of various tumors. However, the expression and function of FGD5-AS1 in ovarian cancer (OC) and its mechanism of action are not yet clear. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to explore the expression levels of FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p in OC. The relationship between the expression of FGD5-AS1 and clinicopathological indicators of OC patients was analyzed by χ2 test. CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, and Transwell assay were carried out to detect cell proliferation, migration, as well as invasion, respectively. Subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment and lung metastasis model were used to examine the biological effects of FGD5-AS1 in OC in vivo. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay or RIP experiment was employed to explore the targeting relationship between FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p, as well as miR-142-5p and PD-L1 3'UTR. First, we found that FGD5-AS1 was markedly up-regulated in OC. Moreover, its high expression level was associated with positive local lymph node metastasis and higher T stage in OC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that FGD5-AS1 facilitated the proliferation, migration, as well as invasion of OC cells. Mechanistically, it was revealed that FGD5-AS1 targeted miR-142-5p to repress its expression and function. Furthermore, miR-142-5p has a binding site for 3' UTR of PD-L1, and FGD5-AS1 could positively regulate PD-L1 expression via repressing miR-142-5p. The present study reports that FGD5-AS1/miR-142-5p/PD-L1 axis is involved in regulating OC progression.","Aichen, Zhang; Kun, Wang; Xiaochun, Sun; Lingling, Tong",Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10495-021-01674-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974163/,196

Here we report the use of guanidine hydrochloride and combined primer sets to increase speed and sensitivity in colorimetric LAMP, bringing this simple method up to the standards of sophisticated techniques and enabling accurate, high-throughput diagnostics.","Zhang, Yinhua; Ren, Guoping; Buss, Jackson; Barry, Andrew J; Patton, Gregory C; Tanner, Nathan A",BioTechniques,https://doi.org/10.2144/btn-2020-0078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635743/,196
92903,The Role of Alcohol Biomarkers in Detecting a Physician's COVID-19-Related Acute Stress Response: A Case Report.,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND Despite the value of simulation for surgical training, it is unclear whether acquired competencies persist long term. A prior randomized trial showed that structured simulation improves knowledge of the safe use of electrosurgery (ES) amongst trainees up to 3 months after the curriculum (Madani et al. in Surg Endosc 28(10):2772-2782, 2014). We now analyse long-term knowledge retention. This study estimates the effects of a structured simulation-based curriculum to teach the safe use of ES on knowledge after 1 year. METHODS Trainees previously participated in a 1-h didactic ES course, followed by randomization into one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Knowledge of pre- and post-curriculum (immediate, 3 months and 1 year) and knowledge of ES safety were assessed using different multiple-choice examinations. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range), *p < 0.05. RESULTS Fifty-nine trainees participated (30 control group; 29 Sim group). Despite equal baseline examination scores, Sim group demonstrated higher scores compared to control immediately (89% [83; 94] vs. 83% [71; 86]*), 3 months (77% [69; 90] vs. 60% [51; 80]*) and 1 year after curriculum (70% [61; 74] vs. 60% [31; 71]*). One-year score remained significantly greater compared to baseline in the Sim group (70% [61; 74] vs. 49% [43; 57]*), but was similar to baseline in the control group (60% [31; 71] vs. 45% [34; 52]). CONCLUSIONS After ES simulation training, retention of competencies persists longer when the hands-on component is designed to reinforce specific learning objectives in a structured curriculum. Despite routine clinical use of ES devices, knowledge degrades overtime, suggesting the need for ongoing formal educational activities to reinforce curricular objectives.","Madani, Amin; Watanabe, Yusuke; Vassiliou, Melina C; Fuchshuber, Pascal; Jones, Daniel B; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4320-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139486/,196

METHODS A national survey on attitudes toward MIS was sent to the chairs of departments of surgery and divisions of general surgery across the 16 Canadian academic centers. The survey contained 34 questions consisting of Likert scales, single answers, and multiple-choice questions. Nonresponders were contacted directly. At the time of the survey, two department chair positions were vacant. RESULTS The response rate was 87% (26/30). The majority of the centers used early operating room exposure to basic MIS cases (92%) and animal labs (85%). Two-thirds of the institutions used early operating room exposure to advanced MIS cases (69%) and didactic lectures (65%). Half of the academic centers used MIS video (54%) and the laparoscopic virtual reality simulator (54%). The least used method was computer software (19%). The surgical division and department chairs believed the most effective teaching method was early operating room exposure to basic MIS cases (100%), followed by the laparoscopic virtual reality simulator (91%) and animal labs (88%). Computer software was considered 42% useful, and the least useful method was didactic lectures (16%). In the next 5 years, 62% of academic centers plan to add laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to their MIS curriculum. CONCLUSION The chairs' opinion on the most effective MIS teaching method for residents is basic MIS cases followed by laparoscopic virtual reality simulators. The majority of academic institutions plan to add laparoscopic virtual reality simulators to the curriculum in the next 5 years.","Chan, Beverley; Martel, Guillaume; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0611-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19585067/,196
95221,Combined evaluation of right ventricular function using echocardiography in non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.,2021-08-04,"OBJECTIVES Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is common and contributes to significant disability and healthcare costs. The mechanism and etiology of CLBP are frequently unclear, and treatment choices vary. MATERIALS AND METHODS The scientific literature, including expert-generated treatment guidelines, was reviewed and evaluated for data regarding CLBP prevalence and predictors and for evidence of outcomes from pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. RESULTS Evidence is inconclusive as to superior treatments for CLBP. Even therapies with literature support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids administered short term, do not work for every patient, and combination therapies are frequently beneficial. Early intervention with acute pain may stop the progression to chronicity in predisposed patients; however, much acute back pain resolves spontaneously. Predictors of chronicity include continuing poor function, unwillingness to remain active, psychiatric comorbidities, general poor health, and maladaptive coping strategies. Indefinite diagnoses and genetic vulnerabilities are likely factors in variable patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Personalized treatment plans should be informed by response to therapies previously tried, the severity and persistence of symptoms, and the availability of specialist expertise.","Webster, Lynn R; Markman, John",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00496.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25395113/,196

However, at higher doses, rhBMP-2 does not necessarily increase bone formation but rather increases the incidence of adverse side effects. Here, we investigated whether umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC)-derived nanovesicles (NVs) further increase the in vivo bone formation at high doses of rhBMP-2. In the presence of UCMSC-derived NVs, proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated in vitro. Furthermore, migration and osteogenesis of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were stimulated. To examine the efficacy of UCMSC-derived NVs on in vivo bone formation, collagen sponges soaked with rhBMP-2 and UCMSC-derived NVs were used in athymic nude mice with calvarial defects. At a high rhBMP-2 dosage (500 ng/mL), UCMSC-derived NVs significantly promoted bone formation in calvarial defects; however, the UCMSC-derived NVs alone did not induce in vivo bone formation. Our results indicate that UCMSC-derived NVs can potentiate the bone formation efficacy of rhBMP-2 at a high dosage.","Lim, Songhyun; Lyu, Hao-Zhen; Lee, Ju-Ro; Han, Shi Huan; Lee, Jae Hyup; Kim, Byung-Soo",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899307/,196
97229,Electrical Impedance Tomography and Prone Position During Ventilation in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Case Reports and a Brief Literature Review.,2020-09-13,"The hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein promotes influenza virus entry and is the key protective antigen in natural immunity and vaccines. The HA protein is a trimeric envelope glycoprotein consisting of a globular receptor-binding domain (HA-RBD) that is inserted into a membrane fusion-mediating stalk domain. Similar to other class I viral fusion proteins, the fusogenic stalk domain spontaneously refolds into its postfusion conformation when expressed in isolation, consistent with this domain being trapped in a metastable conformation. Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the influenza virus HA-RBD refolds spontaneously into its native, immunogenic structure even when expressed in an unglycosylated form in Escherichia coli. In the 2.10-Å structure of the HA-RBD, the receptor-binding pocket is intact and its conformational epitopes are preserved. Recombinant HA-RBD is immunogenic and protective in ferrets, and the protein also binds with specificity to sera from influenza virus-infected humans. Overall, the data provide a structural basis for the rapid production of influenza vaccines in E. coli. From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability of the HA-RBD to refold spontaneously into its native conformation suggests that influenza virus acquired this domain as an insertion into an ancestral membrane-fusion domain. The insertion of independently folding domains into fusogenic stalk domains may be a common feature of class I viral fusion proteins.","DuBois, Rebecca M; Aguilar-Yañez, José Manuel; Mendoza-Ochoa, Gonzalo I; Oropeza-Almazán, Yuriana; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Alvarez, Mario Moisés; White, Stephen W; Russell, Charles J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01412-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068239/,196

The European Group on Immunology of Sepsis has identified major gaps that should be addressed with high priority, such as understanding how immunological alterations predispose to sepsis, key aspects of the immunopathological events during sepsis, and the long-term consequences of sepsis on patient's immunity. We discuss major unmet topics in those three categories, including the role of key immune cells, the cause of lymphopenia, organ-specific immunology, the dynamics of sepsis-associated immunological alterations, the role of the microbiome, the standardisation of immunological tests, the development of better animal models, and the opportunities offered by immunotherapy. Addressing these gaps should help us to better understand sepsis physiopathology, offering translational opportunities to improve its prevention, diagnosis, and care.","Rubio, Ignacio; Osuchowski, Marcin F; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Skirecki, Tomasz; Winkler, Martin Sebastian; Lachmann, Gunnar; La Rosée, Paul; Monneret, Guillaume; Venet, Fabienne; Bauer, Michael; Brunkhorst, Frank M; Kox, Matthijs; Cavaillon, Jean-Marc; Uhle, Florian; Weigand, Markus A; Flohé, Stefanie B; Wiersinga, W Joost; Martin-Fernandez, Marta; Almansa, Raquel; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Torres, Antoni; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Girardis, Massimo; Cossarizza, Andrea; Netea, Mihai G; van der Poll, Tom; Scherag, André; Meisel, Christian; Schefold, Joerg C; Bermejo-Martín, Jesús F",The Lancet.

We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.","Basu, Sanjay; Friedland, Gerald H; Medlock, Jan; Andrews, Jason R; Shah, N Sarita; Gandhi, Neel R; Moll, Anthony; Moodley, Prashini; Sturm, A Willem; Galvani, Alison P",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0812472106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19365076/,196

METHODS The study included 29 patients with 29 recanalized aneurysms who were treated by flow diverters (Silk or Pipeline devices). Pre- and post-procedural complications and morbidity and mortality rates were evaluated and functional outcomes (modified Rankin Score (mRS)) at 1 month (short-term) and 3-4 months (mid-term) were compared with preoperative mRS (before the procedure). Mid-term angiographic follow-up was performed assessing aneurysmal occlusion by the Montreal scale (complete occlusion, neck remnant, aneurysm remnant). RESULTS Placement of the flow diverters was achieved in all patients. Two misdeployments of the flow diverters necessitated balloon dilation in two patients, which was associated with stent delivery in one patient. Permanent morbidity related to treatment was 6.9% (2/29), transient morbidity was 10.3% (3/29) and there were no deaths resulting from the treatment. One patient died from a myocardial infarct 4 weeks after the procedure. 25/29 patients (86.2%) had a good final functional outcome, 26/29 (89.7%) had an unchanged functional outcome and 2/29 patients (6.9%) had clinical worsening. Angiographic follow-up showed complete occlusion in 17/28 patients (60.7%), neck remnants in 6/28 patients (21.4%) and residual aneurysms in 5/28 (17.9%).

However, there have been religious and social concerns surrounding this allotransplantation alternative. The purpose of this study was to explore the acceptance of XTx among stakeholders of the congenital heart disease (CHD) community. METHODS A Likert-scale anonymous survey was distributed to physicians and nurses who care for children with CHD and parents of children with CHD. Psychosocial and clinical attitudes were compared across all groups to identify differences, and regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with XTx acceptance. RESULTS A total of 297 responded to the survey: 134 physicians, 62 nurses, and 101 parents. Potential acceptance of XTx if outcomes were similar to allotransplantation was high overall (75.3%), but different between the groups (physicians 86%; nurses 71%, parents 64%; P < .0001). Regression analysis showed respondents who reported religion would influence medical decision making (OR 0.48; 95%CI 0.24-0.97) and those who would not use a pig heart transplant as a bridge until a human heart became available were less likely to accept XTx (OR 0.09; 95%CI 0.04-0.21). Psychosocial concerns to XTx were minimal but were also associated with XTx acceptance particularly among parents (OR 0.17; 95%CI 0.03-0.80). CONCLUSIONS Potential acceptance of XTx is high, assuming results are similar to allotransplantation. Religious beliefs and attitudes toward the use of XTx as a bridge to allotransplant may present barriers to XTx acceptance.

To address this need, in 2011 the Ministry of Public Health and Population established the Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Programme (Y-FETP). Aims To describe the Y-FETP and its strengths and challenges in addressing Yemen's National Health System (NHS) needs. Methods We describe the structure and functions of the Y-FETPs and analyse the achievements and challenges of the first 7 years of programme implementation as they relate to the NHS. Results The Y-FETP is a postgraduate competency-based training with the objective of strengthening capacity in field epidemiology so that events of public health importance can be detected and investigated in a timely and effective manner. Since its establishment, the Y-FETP has successfully trained 30 health professionals in advanced field epidemiology. Furthermore, trainees investigated over 100 outbreaks, analysed and evaluated 95 surveillance systems, conducted 30 planned studies and presented 70 oral and poster presentations at national and international conferences. The main challenges are low retention of graduates by the NHS and financial unsustainability. Conclusions The Y-FETP has strengthened the capacity of the Yemen health workforce and has been instrumental in supporting the NHS, especially during the war and the current crisis and health emergency as the security situation deteriorated and access to outside experts becomes limited. The programme provides a practical example of health systems strengthening through health workforce capacity development that can be replicated in countries with similar health workforce capacity challenges.","Al Serouri, Abdulwahed; Jumaan, Aisha; Alkohlani, Abdulhakem",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://doi.org/10.26719/2018.24.9.905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30570123/,196

Barbed polyglyconate suture was first used for the UVA during RARP beginning in January 2010; safety and feasibility were previously demonstrated in 51 patients. METHODS From May to September 2010, 64 patients meeting all the inclusion criteria participated in the present multisurgeon prospective, randomized, controlled trial and underwent posterior repair and UVA during RARP with either barbed polyglyconate (n=33) or monofilament poliglecaprone (n=31) suture. The primary outcomes were the anastomotic (UVA) and posterior reconstruction times. Secondary outcomes included cystogram leak, bladder neck reconstruction rate, and 6-week functional outcomes assessed by a self-administered validated patient questionnaire. RESULTS Posterior reconstruction was performed within 3.3 minutes with the barbed suture versus 4.3 minutes with the monofilament poliglecaprone suture (23.3% reduction) and UVA within 10.1 versus 13.8 minutes, respectively (26.8% reduction). The absolute time difference for the 2-layer anastomosis was 4.7 minutes (a 26.0% reduction in the total anastomosis time). All other perioperative outcomes were equivalent between the 2 groups. Urinary functional outcomes, including the pad use and leakage rates, were equivalent at 6 weeks. CONCLUSION Anastomosis during RARP with the V-Loc barbed suture can be performed safely and more efficiently than with standard monofilament suture. We demonstrated a 26% decrease in the anastomotic time with no increase in the adverse events, no instances of urinary retention and equivalent functional outcomes were measured with the self-administered patient questionnaire.","Sammon, Jesse; Kim, Tae-Kyung; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Bhandari, Akshay; Kaul, Sanjeev; Sukumar, Shyam; Rogers, Craig G; Peabody, James O",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2011.03.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21782218/,196

OBJECTIVES to describe some organizational aspects and resources involved in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN observational cross sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS a survey of methods and tools adopted by the competent service (Prevention department) in the Local public health units (LHU) of the regional Health services has been performed in May 2020. The survey collected data related to activities carried out during the month of April 2020 on the surveillance system for collection of suspected cases, their virological ascertainment, the isolation procedures and contact-tracing activities by means of an online questionnaire filled in by the public health structure of the regional health system. A convenience sample of Prevention departments was recruited. RESULTS in 44 Prevention departments of 14 Regions/Autonomous Provinces (caring for 40% of the population residing in Italy), different services were swiftly engaged in pandemic response. Reports of suspected cases were about 3 times the number of confirmed cases in the same month. Local reporting form was used in 46% of the LHUs while a regional form was available in 42% of the Departments (in 9/14 Regions). In one fourth the forms were not always used and 2% had no forms for the reporting of suspected cases. Data were recorded in 52% of LHUs on local databases, while in 20% a regional database (in 7 Regions) had been created. A proportion of 11% did not record the data for further elaboration. The virological assessment with nasopharyngeal swabs out of the hospital setting was carried out on the average in 7 points in each LHU (median 5) and the average daily capacity was 350 (71 per 100,000) swabs. The rate of subjects newly tested during the month of April was of 893 per 100,000 new people. Data collected at the swabbing were recorded on a regional platform in 17 LHUs (39%) of 8 Regions. In 7% LHUs only positive specimens were recorded electronically. Local files were used in 27% LHUs. The interview with confirmed cases was carried out with a local questionnaire in 52% LHUs, while 14% stated that a standardized form was not used. The data collected about cases were recorded on a regional IT platform in 30% Departments (in 8 Regions) and in 41% data were registered only locally. For each confirmed case in April, a median of 4 contacts were identified. Only 13 (30%) Departments in 9 Regions have registered contact data on a regional database. Ten Departments (23%) have only hard copies, while 56% recorded data on local databases. About 5 health professionals for 100,000 resident population were involved in each LHU in each of the following activities as receiving reports of suspected cases, swabs collection, interviews of cases and contact identifications. CONCLUSIONS the pandemic required rapidly a great organizational effort and great flexibility to increase response capacity, which now must be strengthened and maintained. Several different tools (forms and electronic files) have been developed in each LHU and used for the same surveillance operational processes with a loss in local efficiency.

Data presented in here are from field research conducted in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, a small river town located east of Pittsburgh. Once a thriving industrial city, it is now deteriorated and has documented high levels of overdose experience. Preliminary results suggest that McKeesport residents, even before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), practice social and physical distancing as a way of life; data indicate how the pandemic potentially exacerbates the risk of accidental opioid overdose among a population defined by both geographic and social isolation.","Trappen, Sandra L; McLean, Katherine J",Journal of prevention & intervention in the community,https://doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2021.1908206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998397/,196
111218,Chest CT and Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A More Complete Review.,2020-05-22,"Background Primary hyperhidrosis is a functionally and socially disabling condition resulting in social embarrassment and low quality of life. Thoracic sympathectomy is a definitive choice of treatment with favorable results. However, patients may face another embarrassing condition following surgery as compensatory hyperhidrosis which has no definitive treatment. The predictors of compensatory hyperhidrosis are controversial and remain unclear. Patients and methods A total of 74 patients underwent a videothoracoscopic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis. We statistically analyzed our patients with correlations and uni-multivariate logistic regression models to outline the possible predictors of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Results A total of 45 (60.8%) patients had compensatory hyperhidrosis. The correlations showed that patients, with age greater than 21 years (P = 0.018), with body mass index (BMI) greater than 22 kg / m2 (P = 0.045), with isolated facial hyperhidrosis (P = 0.044), and with smoking status (P = 0.015), had significantly greater rates of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Similarly, the significant univariate predictors of compensatory hyperhidrosis were age > 21 (P = 0.020), BMI > 22 kg / m2 (P = 0.048), and the presence of smoking status (P = 0.015). Multivariate analysis revealed only smoking as a predictor within the threshold of significance (P = 0.078). Conclusion The clinical predictors of compensatory hyperhidrosis following a thoracic sympathectomy appear as older age, greater body mass index, and smoking.","Kara, Murat; Kose, Selcuk; Cayirci, Can Ertug; Koksal, Ayhan","Indian journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official organ, Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12055-018-0769-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061004/,196

METHODS Consecutive patients who experienced failed reperfusion and subsequently did or did not undergo RS at 16 comprehensive stroke centers were enrolled from January 2015 to June 2018. Propensity score matching was used to achieve baseline balance between the patient groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) at 48 hours and the modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in the two groups were compared. RESULTS A total of 90 patients with RS and 117 patients without RS after failed MT were enrolled. Propensity score matching analysis selected 132 matched patients. The good outcome rate was significantly higher in matched patients with RS than in those without RS (36.4% vs 19.7%, p=0.033), whereas the sICH (13.6% vs 21.2%, p=0.251) and mortality (31.9% vs 43.9%, p=0.151) were not significantly different between the groups.

AIM/OBJECTIVE May 2010 to May 2012, 122 consecutive patients with preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 33 ± 2.5 kg/m² (range 30-34.9) undergoing LSG were studied. Mean age was 33 ± 10 years (range 15-60), and 105 (86%) were women. Mean preoperative weight was 91 ± 9.7 kg (range 66-121), and preoperative excess weight was 30 ± 6.7 kg (range 19-43). Comorbidities were detected in 44 (36%) patients. RESULTS Mean operative time was 58 ± 15 min (range 40-95), and postoperative stay was 1.8 ± 0.19 days (range 1.5-3). There were no admissions to intensive care unit and no deaths within 30 days of surgery. The rates of leaks and strictures were 0%, and of hemorrhage 1.6%. At 12 months, BMI decreased to 24.7 ± 2, and the percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) reached 76.5%. None of the patients had a BMI below 20 kg/m².

120298,Medication non-adherence in chronic kidney disease: a mixed-methods review and synthesis using the theoretical domains framework and the behavioural change wheel.,2021-02-09,"Nairoviruses are responsible for numerous diseases that affect both humans and animal. Recent work has implicated the viral ovarian tumor domain (vOTU) as a possible nairovirus virulence factor due to its ability to edit ubiquitin (Ub) bound to cellular proteins and, at least in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), to cleave the Ub-like protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), a protein involved in the regulation of host immunity. The prospective roles of vOTUs in immune evasion have generated several questions concerning whether vOTUs act through a preserved specificity for Ub- and ISG15-conjugated proteins and where that specificity may originate. To gain insight into the substrate specificity of vOTUs, enzymological studies were conducted on vOTUs from Dugbe, CCHFV, and Erve nairoviruses. These studies revealed that vOTUs originating from different nairoviruses display a significant divergence in their preference toward Ub and ISG15. In addition, a recently identified vOTU from turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus was evaluated to elucidate any possible similarities between vOTUs originating from different viral families. Although possessing a similar preference for certain polymeric Ub moieties, its activity toward Ub in general was significantly less then those of nairoviruses. Lastly, the X-ray crystallographic structure of the vOTU from the Dugbe nairovirus was obtained in complex with Ub to reveal structural commonalities of vOTUs originating from nairoviruses. The structure suggests that divergences between nairovirus vOTUs specificity originate at the primary structural level. Comparison of this structure to that originating from CCHFV identified key residues that infer the substrate specificity of vOTUs.","Capodagli, Glenn C; Deaton, Michelle K; Baker, Erica A; Lumpkin, Ryan J; Pegan, Scott D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03252-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23345508/,196

STUDY DESIGN National cross-sectional community survey. SETTING Australian general public. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged over 18 years (N = 4362). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p < 0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59%% vs 72% p < 0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. People with inadequate health literacy were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5; p < 0.001) and reported more difficulty with remembering and accessing medicines since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7; p < 0.001). People with lower health literacy were also more likely to endorse misinformed beliefs about COVID-19 and vaccinations (in general) than those with adequate health literacy. The same pattern of results was observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. CONCLUSION Our findings show that there are important disparities in COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours according to people's health literacy and language. These have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. People with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and are also most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19. Addressing the health literacy, language and cultural needs of the community in public health messaging about COVID-19 must now be a priority in Australia.","McCaffery, Kirsten J; Dodd, Rachael H; Cvejic, Erin; Ayrek, Julie; Batcup, Carys; Isautier, Jennifer Mj; Copp, Tessa; Bonner, Carissa; Pickles, Kristen; Nickel, Brooke; Dakin, Thomas; Cornell, Samuel; Wolf, Michael S",Public health research & practice,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp30342012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294907/,196
122658,Early improvements in pulmonary function after severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation.,2020-12-09,"Reperfusion therapy for acute stroke has evolved from the initial use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset to more recent guideline-recommended use up to 4.5 hours. In addition, endovascular therapy is increasingly utilized for stroke treatment and is typically initiated up to 8 hours after onset. Recent studies demonstrate that imaging of the ischemic penumbra with diffusion/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify subgroups of patients who are likely to improve following successful reperfusion (Target Mismatch profile) and others who are at increased risk for hemorrhage and poor clinical outcomes (Malignant profile). New data indicate that stent retriever devices provide better recanalization efficacy and clinical outcomes than the previously available mechanical thrombectomy devices. Going forward, we believe that the use of penumbral imaging with validated MRI techniques, as well as the currently less well-validated computed tomography (CT) perfusion approach, will maximize benefit and reduce the risk of adverse events and poor outcomes when used both early after stroke onset and at later time points. New trials that feature diffusion/perfusion MRI or CT perfusion-based patient selection for treatment with intravenous tPA and or endovascular therapies versus nonreperfused control groups are planned or in progress. We predict that these trials will confirm the hypothesis that penumbral imaging can enhance patient selection and extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.","Fisher, Marc; Albers, Gregory W",Annals of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.23744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378323/,196

In this study, we have analysed the frequency of detection of such mutations in FIPV and FECV strains circulating in Italian cats and obtained information about their evolutionary relationships with reference isolates. A total of 40 FCoV strains, including 19 strains from effusions or tissue samples of FIP cats and 21 strains from faecal samples of non-FIP cats, were analysed. Mutation M1058L was detected in 16/18 FCoV-I and 1/1 FCoV-II strains associated with FIP, while change S1060A was presented by two FIPV strains. By phylogenetic analysis, FCoV sequences clustered according to the genotype but not according to the biotype, with FECV/FIPV strains recovered from the same animal being closely related.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Five pigs underwent dorsal subcutaneous implantation of a polypropylene-based material coated with precision pore silicone granules (sphere-templated scaffold), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, human dermis, and porcine dermis. Sham and undissected sites were also used as controls. Specimens were harvested 7, 21, 90, and 180 days after surgery and evaluated histologically for inflammation, neovascularization, and collagen deposition. RESULTS All materials and sham sites induced a mild to moderate inflammation that decreased over time, except for human dermis, which elicited a moderate to severe inflammatory response. The responses were varied and measurable using subjective scoring methods. The sphere-templated scaffold demonstrated numerous foreign body giant cells adjacent to the silicone granules, which were not seen in any of the other specimens. CONCLUSION Subjective scoring of pathology slides and measurement of capsule thickness appeared to show differences between the materials, but these differences require a larger number of subjects and proper statistical analysis to assess. The robust foreign body reaction elicited by the polypropylene/silicone-based scaffold argues against the use of this material in future studies.

However, systemic evaluation of cadmium exposure for the transformation of prostatic hyperplasia into prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. In the present study, an attempt has been made to establish cadmium-induced human prostate carcinogenesis using an in vitro model of BPH cells. Wide range of cadmium concentrations, i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1μM, were chronically exposed to the human BPH cells for transformation into PCa and monitored using cell and molecular biology approaches. After eight weeks of exposure, the cells showed subtle morphological changes and shifts of cell cycle in the G2M phase. Significant increase in expression of prostatic genes AR, PSA, ER-β, and 5αR with increased nuclear localization of AR and pluripotency markers Cmyc, Klf4 indicated the carcinogenic effect of Cd. Further, the BPH cells exposed to Cd showed a substantial increase in the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, influencing migratory potential of the cells along with decreased expression of the p63 protein which further strengthen the progression towards carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor studies. Data from the present study state that Cd exhibited marked invasiveness in BPH cells. These observations established a connecting link of BPH towards PCa pathogenesis.

125995,Hyperlipasemia does not confer worse clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohort of novel coronavirus patients.,2021-06-01,"The aim of the study was to compare postoperative vaginal cuff complications due to the use of barbed sutures (V-Loc™ 180 unidirectional suture; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) and standard braided sutures (Vicryl®; Ethicon Inc., Somerville, MA) during vaginal cuff closure of patients undergoing a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) due to benign diseases. Eighty-nine patients were in the standard suture group and 208 patients were included in the barbed suture group. Vaginal cuff dehiscence was identified in only three (3.3%) patients within the standard suture group and none in the barbed suture group. Five (5.6%) patients in the standard suture group and two (0.9%) patients in the barbed suture group developed postoperative cuff infection/cellulitis. Duration of the surgery was significantly shorter in the barbed suture group than in the standard suture group (p < .05). V-Loc™ 180 unidirectional barbed suture, which is used during TLH for vaginal cuff closure, is an applicable, safe and tolerable alternative to a standard suture. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject: Barbed sutures are a relatively new type of suture that include sharp barbs inserted on monofilament material in various configurations, and are used for approximating tissues without any need for surgical knotting. They have increasingly been used in obstetrics and gynaecology in recent years, particularly in total laparoscopic hysterectomy and laparoscopic myomectomy. At present, there are a limited number of studies of V-Loc™ suture in the literature. What the results of this study add: We demonstrated that barbed sutures used for enabling vaginal cuff integrity did not cause major morbidity and mortality for the patient. We suggest that V-Loc™ 180 barbed sutures offer a practical, safe and tolerable alternative for surgeons because they are easy to use, do not cause a significant increase in vaginal cuff complications, and shorten the operating time. Our study with V-Loc™ 180 unidirectional barbed suture is the second largest series after the study of Cong et al. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that the barbed suture, the surgery results of which are openly discussed in our study, will be more prominent in clinical practice owing to the shortened operating time, and that the use of these sutures does not cause a significant increase in vaginal cuff complications.","Karacan, Tolga; Ozyurek, Eser; Usta, Taner; Odacilar, Eylem; Hanli, Ulviye; Kovalak, Ebru; Dayan, Huseyin",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2017.1416597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577776/,196

128604,Distribution and risk factors of cleft lip and palate on patients from a sample of Damascus hospitals - A case-control study.,2021-09-01,"Ensuring global cooperation often poses governance problems shadowed by the tragedy of the commons, as wrong-doers enjoy the benefits set up by right-doers at no cost. Institutional punishment of wrong-doers is well-known to curtail their impetus as free-riders. However, institutions often have limited scope in imposing sanctions, more so when these are strict and potentially viewed as disproportionate. Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment. We frame our model within the context of the global reduction of carbon emissions, but the results are shown to be general enough to be applicable to other collective action problems, shedding further light into the origins of Human institutions.","Couto, Marta C; Pacheco, Jorge M; Santos, Francisco C",Journal of theoretical biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726648/,196

Bioinformatic analyses confirmed that H1N1 significantly regulates the RNA degradation pathway via upregulation of CNOT4, while apoptosis could be suppressed by H5N1 through downregulation of the p53 signaling pathway with P≤0.05 at 12 hpi. The HIF-1 signaling pathway of HMCs is more susceptible to infection by H5N1 than by H1N1 virus. This article is protected by copyright.

The Device's safety features included large horizontal aperture, sensitive counterbalanced door, large atrium, and passive overfill prevention. Study group results were also compared with a control cohort of 14 contemporaneous size-matched, Ascension Health hospitals (control group). RESULTS The Device was associated with significant reductions in after-procedure (-30%), disposal-related (-57%), and container-associated (-81%) SI in the study group. No significant reductions occurred in container-associated sharps injuries in the control group. Hospitals using the Device had significantly fewer total SI than control hospitals. CONCLUSION Enhanced aperture design can significantly reduce container-associated sharps injuries. Other factors contributing to reduced injuries may include 1-hand deposit, safe closure, hand restriction, and preassembly. These results, from a country where sharps safety devices are widespread, are particularly applicable to countries where safety devices are not extensively used.","Grimmond, Terry; Bylund, Suzann; Anglea, Candace; Beeke, Lou; Callahan, Angela; Christiansen, Erik; Flewelling, Kelly; McIntosh, Kathleen; Richter, Kay; Vitale, Monica",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2010.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21093697/,196

Since then, remarkable progress has been made on both the basic and clinical research fronts. However, the incidence, recurrence and death rates for melanoma remain unacceptably high and significant challenges remain. Hence, the MRF Scientific Advisory Council and Breakthrough Consortium, a group that includes clinicians and scientists, reconvened to facilitate intensive discussions on thematic areas essential to melanoma researchers and patients alike - prevention, detection, diagnosis, metastatic dormancy and progression, response and resistance to targeted and immune-based therapy, and the clinical consequences of COVID-19 for melanoma patients and providers. These extensive discussions helped to crystalize our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the broader melanoma community today. In this report, we discuss the progress made since the last MRF assessment, comment on what remains to be overcome and offer recommendations for the best path forward.","Atkins, Michael B; Curiel-Lewandrowski, Clara; Fisher, David E; Swetter, Susan M; Tsao, Hensin; Aguirre-Ghiso, Julio A; Soengas, Maria S; Weeraratna, Ashani T; Flaherty, Keith T; Herlyn, Meenhard; Sosman, Jeffrey A; Tawbi, Hussein A; Pavlick, Anna C; Cassidy, Pamela B; Chandra, Sunandana; Chapman, Paul B; Daud, Adil; Eroglu, Zeynep; Ferris, Laura K; Fox, Bernard A; Gerhsenwald, Jeffrey E; Gibney, Geoffrey T; Grossman, Douglas; Hanks, Brent A; Hanniford, Douglas; Hernando, Eva; Jeter, Joanne M; Johnson, Douglas B; Khleif, Samir N; Kirkwood, John M; Leachman, Sancy A; Mays, Darren; Nelson, Kelly C; Sondak, Vernon K; Sullivan, Ryan J; Merlino, Glenn",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-4092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33414132/,196

The current work depends on twelve adult Egyptian fruit bats that observed grossly and with the help of the stereo, light, and scanning electron microscope. There were three types of the lingual papillae; one mechanical filiform and two gustatory (fungiform and circumvallate). There were seven subtypes of filiform papillae were recognized on the seven lingual regions. There were scanty numbers of fungiform papillae distributed among the filiform papillae on the lingual tip and two lateral parts of apex and body while fungiform papillae completely absent in the median part. There were three circumvallate papillae. The central bulb of circumvallate papillae surrounded by one layer of two segmented circular annular bad. The lingual tip had cornflower-like and diamond-shaped filiform papillae. Histochemical results revealed that the lingual glands were a stronger AB-positive reaction and gave dark blue color, while the reaction for the PAS-stain was negative. Also, the glands exhibited a blue color as an indication of positive AB reactivity with combined AB-PAS staining.","Kandyel, R M; Abumandour, M M A; Mahmoud, S F; Shukry, M; Madkour, N; El-Mansi, A; Farrag, F A",Folia morphologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fm.a2021.0042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954957/,196

138585,Peripheral lymphocyte subset monitoring in COVID19 patients: a prospective Italian real-life case series.,2020-05-14,"OBJECTIVES The management of acquired coagulopathy in multiple clinical settings frequently involves fibrinogen supplementation. Cryoprecipitate, a multidonor product, is widely used for the treatment of acquired hypofibrinogenemia following massive bleeding, but it has been associated with adverse events. We aimed to review the latest evidence on cryoprecipitate for treatment of bleeding. METHODS We conducted a narrative review of current literature on cryoprecipitate therapy, describing its history, formulations and preparation, and recommended dosing. We also reviewed guideline recommendations on the use of cryoprecipitate in bleeding situations and recent studies on its efficacy and safety. RESULTS Cryoprecipitate has a relatively high fibrinogen content; however, as it is produced by pooling fresh frozen donor plasma, the fibrinogen content per unit can vary considerably. Current guidelines suggest that cryoprecipitate use should be limited to treating hypofibrinogenemia in patients with clinical bleeding. Until recently, cryoprecipitate was deemed unsuitable for pathogen reduction, and potential safety concerns and lack of standardized fibrinogen content have led to some professional bodies recommending that cryoprecipitate is only indicated for the treatment of bleeding and hypofibrinogenemia in perioperative settings where fibrinogen concentrate is not available. While cryoprecipitate is effective in increasing plasma fibrinogen levels, data on its clinical efficacy are limited. CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of robust evidence to support the use of cryoprecipitate in bleeding patients, with few prospective, randomized clinical trials performed to date. Clinical trials in bleeding settings are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of cryoprecipitate and to determine its optimal use and administration.","Nascimento, Barto; Levy, Jerrold H; Tien, Homer; Da Luz, Luis Teodoro",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2019.409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084562/,196

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Six electronic databases up to 22 September 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Inclusion criteria were (1) overhead athletes from Olympic or college sports, (2) preseason measures of shoulder ROM, (3) tracked in-season injuries at the shoulder and elbow, and (4) prospective cohort design. Exclusion criteria were (1) included contact injuries, (2) lower extremity, spine and hand injuries, and (3) full report not published in English. RESULTS Fifteen studies were identified, and they included 3314 overhead athletes (baseball (74.6%), softball (3.1%), handball (16.1%), tennis (2.0%), volleyball (2.0%) and swimming (2.2%)). Female athletes are unrepresented (12% of the overall sample). Study quality ranged from 11 to 18 points on a modified Downs and Black checklist (maximum score 21, better quality). In one study, swimmers with low (<93°) or high (>100°) shoulder external rotation were at higher risk of injuries. Using data pooled from three studies of professional baseball pitchers, we showed in the meta-analysis that shoulder external rotation insufficiency (throwing arm <5° greater than the non-throwing arm) was associated with injury (odds ratio=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 2.92, p<0.01). CONCLUSION Preseason screening of shoulder external rotation ROM may identify professional baseball pitchers and swimmers at risk of injury. Shoulder ROM screening may not be effective to identify handball, softball, volleyball and tennis players at risk of injuries. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies and their high degree of heterogeneity.

When this system delivers noisy or erred information it can, in some cases, be attenuated through habituation. Here we investigate whether multiple mechanisms of attenuation act to decrease vestibular gain due to noise added using supra-threshold random-waveform galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). Forty-five participants completed one of three conditions. Each condition consisted of two 4-min standing periods with stimulation surrounding a 1-h period of either walking with stimulation, walking without stimulation, or sitting quietly. An instrumented treadmill recorded horizontal forces at the feet during standing and walking. We quantified response attenuation to GVS by comparing vestibular stimulus-horizontal force gain between conditions. First stimulus exposure caused an 18% decrease in gain during the first 40 s of standing. Attenuation recommenced only when subjects walked with stimulation, resulting in a 38% decrease in gain over 60 min that did not transfer to standing following walking. The disparity in attenuation dynamics and absent carry over between standing and walking suggests that two mechanisms of attenuation, one associated with first exposure to the stimulus and another that is task specific, may act to decrease vestibulomotor gain.","Hannan, Kelci B; Todd, Makina K; Pearson, Nicole J; Forbes, Patrick A; Dakin, Christopher J",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87485-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33854124/,196

146059,Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease as interconnected syndromes.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Treatment options for patients with fecal incontinence (FI) are limited, and surgical treatments can be associated with high rates of infection and other complications. One treatment, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), is approved for FI in Europe. A large multicenter trial was conducted in North America and Australia to assess the efficacy of SNS in patients with chronic fecal incontinence. The aim of this report was to analyze the infectious complication rates in that trial. METHODS Adult patients with a history of chronic fecal incontinence were enrolled into this study. Those patients who fulfilled study inclusion/exclusion criteria and demonstrated greater than two FI episodes per week underwent a 2-week test phase of SNS. Patients who showed a > or = 50% reduction in incontinent episodes and/or days per week underwent chronic stimulator implantation. Adverse events were reported to the sponsor by investigators at each study site and then coded. All events coded as implant site infection were included in this analysis. RESULTS One hundred twenty subjects (92% female, 60.5 +/- 12.5 years old) received a chronically implanted InterStim Therapy device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Patients were followed for an average of 28 months (range 2.2-69.5). Thirteen of the 120 implanted subjects (10.8%) reported infection after the chronic system implant. One infection spontaneously resolved and five were successfully treated with antibiotics. Seven infections (5.8%) required surgical intervention, with infections in six patients requiring full permanent device explantation. The duration of the test stimulation implant procedure was similar between the infected group (74 min) and the non-infected group (74 min). The average duration of the chronic neurostimulator implant procedure was also similar between the infected (39 min) and non-infected group (37 min). Nine infections occurred within a month of chronic system implant and the remaining four infections occurred more than a year from implantation. While the majority (7/9) of the early infections was successfully treated with observation, antibiotics, or system replacement, all four of the late infections resulted in permanent system explantation. CONCLUSION SNS for FI resulted in a relatively low infection rate. This finding is especially important because the only other Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for end-stage FI, the artificial bowel sphincter, reports a much higher rate. Combined with its published high therapeutic success rate, this treatment has a positive risk/benefit profile.","Wexner, Steven D; Hull, Tracy; Edden, Yair; Coller, John A; Devroede, Ghislain; McCallum, Richard; Chan, Miranda; Ayscue, Jennifer M; Shobeiri, Abbas S; Margolin, David; England, Michael; Kaufman, Howard; Snape, William J; Mutlu, Ece; Chua, Heidi; Pettit, Paul; Nagle, Deborah; Madoff, Robert D; Lerew, Darin R; Mellgren, Anders",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-010-1177-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354809/,196

We hypothesized that the NRM advantage of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and higher GVL associated with greater HLA disparities would expand its use for patients (40-60 years) without compromising efficacy, and compared outcomes between RIC versus MAC regimens. 288 patients aged 40 to 60 years, with de novo AML, receiving UCBT with at least 2 HLA mismatches with RIC (n=166) or MAC (n=122) regimens were included. As compared to RIC, the MAC cohort included relatively younger patients, having received more single UCBT, with lower total nucleated cell counts, and more in vivo T-cell depletion. Median time to neutrophil engraftment, infections (bacterial, viral and fungal), as well as grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were similar in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, overall survival (HR-0.98, p=0.9), NRM (HR-0.68, p=0.2) and relapse (HR- 1.24, p=0.5) were not different between RIC and MAC.

We aimed to obtain a clear homeopathic clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and postulate the genus epidemicus of the disease in order to inform and enhance future treatment and prophylaxis options. METHODS We conducted a prospective case series study, collecting data from 19 homeopaths in Catalonia, Spain, from patients who presented with fever and/or cough and/or breathlessness and/or confirmed COVID-19 infection or close contact with a confirmed case. We included 107 patients, and data were recorded through a checklist questionnaire on the day of the case analysis and at day 10-15 after commencing treatment. Symptoms were collected and analyzed with the help of homeopathic repertories. RESULTS A total of 103 cases were mild or moderate; four were severe. The severe cases were excluded from the analysis and the 103 mild and moderate cases were analyzed and a clear overall clinical picture with mental, general, and particular symptoms was achieved. Eighty-eight cases had a complete recorded follow-up. The most prescribed medicines were Bry, Ars, Phos and Gels, whilst those with the best rates of good response were Sulph, Puls and Bry. Time to full recovery after homeopathic treatment ranged from 3.5 to 14.4 days, depending on the medicine used. The potency 200c was associated with faster rates of full recovery and a lesser need to change remedy.

151249,Acute Kidney Injury in a National Cohort of Hospitalized US Veterans with COVID-19.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a precursor lesion of pseudomyxoma peritonei, which, if treated suboptimally, may later disseminate throughout the abdominal cavity. We previously demonstrated the role of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to reduce the dissemination risk. Here we describe the feasibility and safety of minimal access cytoreductive surgery (MACRS) and HIPEC as an alternative to the open approach. METHODS We evaluated patients with LAMNs at risk of dissemination (known as LAMN II) who were referred to a national treatment centre between 2010 and 2012 and comparison is made between this group and patients undergoing open CRS and HIPEC for the same pathology over the same time period. RESULTS Of the 39 patients with LAMN II, 10 patients were treated by MACRS and HIPEC and 7 were treated by an open approach. Among the MACRS procedures, there were no conversions to open surgery; median procedure length, median length of stay, and complication rates were similar between groups and there were no 30-day deaths. After 3- and 11-months median follow-up respectively, no patients have evidence of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS The present series demonstrates that MACRS and HIPEC is a feasible and safe alternative to the open procedure with the advantage of smaller abdominal wounds and comparable morbidity and inpatient stay. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the impact on disease progression.","Fish, Rebecca; Selvasekar, Chelliah; Crichton, Peter; Wilson, Malcolm; Fulford, Paul; Renehan, Andrew; O'Dwyer, Sarah",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3189-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24061624/,196

152009,Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing 2015 end of year summary: tissue oxygenation and microcirculation.,2016,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the outcome of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) treated with stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA). METHODS Following IRB approval, a retrospective evaluation of 98 SRFA treatment sessions of 189 CRLMs in 63 consecutive patients was performed. Local recurrence rate (LR), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed. RESULTS LR was identified in 16% of the tumours (31/189), with no significant differences (P = 0.635) when comparing tumour sizes <3 cm (17.7%), 3-5 cm (11.1%) and >5 cm (17.4%). The median OS from SRFA treatment was 33.2 months after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range 2-66); the corresponding 1-, 3- and 5- year survival rates were 87%, 44% and 27%. The median OS was significantly different when comparing unresectable and resectable patients (27 vs. 58 months, P = 0.002) with OS rates of 92%, 66% and 48% at 1, 3 and 5 years in resectable patients. Tumour size did not affect OS and DFS. CONCLUSION Due to the favourable outcome, SRFA challenges resection as first-line local treatment of patients with CRLM. As long as randomised studies are pending, we recommend entering an individual decision-making process with every patient. KEY POINTS Large colorectal liver metastases can be effectively treated by stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA). Using SRFA the overall survival is not affected by tumour size. SRFA achieves similar overall and disease-free survival rates as surgical resection. SRFA challenges surgical resection as the first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases.","Bale, Reto; Widmann, Gerlig; Schullian, Peter; Haidu, Marion; Pall, Georg; Klaus, Alexander; Weiss, Helmut; Biebl, Matthias; Margreiter, Raimund",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-011-2314-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22071776/,196

METHODS From among a total of 199 patients who received T-mab-based chemotherapy for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer between 2011 and 2018, the subjects of this retrospective analysis were 20 patients who subsequently underwent radical gastrectomy. RESULTS Seven patients had gastroesophageal junction cancer and 13 had gastric cancer. Eleven patients had unresectable stage IV cancer and 9 had resectable metastatic disease. Chemotherapy regimens included capecitabine, cisplatin + T-mab (11 patients), and S-1, oxaliplatin + T-mab (nine patients). The median number of chemotherapy cycles before surgery was three (range, 2-62). During preoperative chemotherapy, grade 3/4 adverse events developed in six patients. None suffered grade ≥ 3b postoperative complications. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58.9% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION Combined preoperative T-mab-based chemotherapy and surgery appears to be safe and effective for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, with a clinically meaningful impact on RFS and OS.","Takahashi, Ryo; Nunobe, Souya; Osumi, Hiroki; Takahari, Daisuke; Yamamoto, Noriko; Ida, Satoshi; Kumagai, Koshi; Ohashi, Manabu; Sano, Takeshi; Hiki, Naoki",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02011-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451714/,196

Among them, the spectrum-based SPR sensing devices have offered us great advantages in high-throughput sensing due to their large dynamic range and the possibility of detection resolution similar to that offered by angle interrogation. This paper demonstrates a spectrum-based SPR imaging sensing system with fast wavelength scanning capability achieved by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and a low-cost and speckle-free halogen lamp implemented as the SPR excitation source. Especially, we developed a novel four-parameter-based spectral curve readjusting (4-PSCR) method for data processing, which offered us a faster and more accurate spectral data curve fitting process than the traditional polynomial fitting method. With the configuration, we have also conducted an SPR high-throughput detection of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spike protein, proving its application possibility in the screening of COVID-19 with high accuracy. We believe that the higher sensitivity and accuracy of the system have made it readily used in biochemical imaging and detecting applications.","Wang, Xueliang; Zeng, Youjun; Zhou, Jie; Chen, Jiajie; Miyan, Ruibiao; Zhang, Han; Qu, Junle; Ho, Ho-Pui; Gao, Bruce Zhi; Shao, Yonghong",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33319993/,196

A 53-year-old breast cancer patient who underwent breast-conserving surgery of the right breast presented with fever, leukocytosis, C-reactive protein elevation, and redness of the right breast on postoperative day (POD) 3. The breast wound showed desquamation with painful ulcerative changes from POD 6, and fever was sustained under antibiotic administration. Wound irrigation was attempted; however, inflammatory skin damage progressed to involvement of the entire skin overlying the breast. With clinical suspicion of PPG, skin biopsy and systemic corticosteroid initiation were performed on POD 12. Wound damage progression ceased, and the systemic inflammation subsided. The patient underwent split-thickness skin grafting under intravenous corticosteroid administration, and the wound healed after 30 days. PPG is a rare clinical scenario. Early diagnosis is critical to avoid unnecessary treatment and aggravation of the surgical wound.","Kim, Dabin; Hur, Sung Mo; Lee, Jae Seok; Chin, Susie; Lim, Cheol Wan; Kim, Zisun",Journal of breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2021.24.e25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128363/,196

We aimed to assess the relationship between perceived pain severity after surgery and the amount of opioid medications prescribed at discharge in US vs. non-US patients. METHODS We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the International Patterns of Opioid Prescribing (iPOP) multicenter study. Patients aged 16 and older who underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or inguinal herniorrhaphy in one of 14 participating hospitals across 8 countries between October 2016 and March 2017 were included. In hospitals where pain severity was assessed using a 0-10 visual analog scale before hospital discharge, patients were stratified into four groups depending on the pain severity: none, mild (1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe (7-10). The number of opioid prescriptions, total number of pills, and oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) prescribed were calculated for each group and a comparison between US and non-US patients was performed. RESULTS A total of 2,024 patients were included. Eighty-three percent of US patients without pain were prescribed opioids compared to 8.7% of non-US patients without pain (p-value <0.001). The number of opioid prescriptions, the number of pills and OMEs prescribed were similar across the four pain severity groups in US patients (p-values >0.05). In contrast, the number of opioid prescriptions and the number of opioid pills and OMEs prescribed among non-US patients were incrementally higher as the pain severity progressed from no pain to severe pain (all p-values <0.05). CONCLUSION US patients are prescribed opioids at high rates and doses regardless of pain severity. Further efforts should be directed towards tailoring opioid prescriptions to patients' needs.","El Moheb, Mohamad; Mokhtari, Ava; Han, Kelsey; van Erp, Inge; Kongkaewpaisan, Napaporn; Jia, Zhenyi; Rodriguez, Gabriel; Kongwibulwut, Manasnun; Kaafarani, Haytham Ma",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.08.771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977034/,196
158422,Peripartum Covid-19 Pneumonia with Severe ARDS - A Case Report.,2021-04-01,"A previous phylogenetic study suggested that mammalian gammaretroviruses may have originated in bats. Here we report the discovery of RNA transcripts from two putative endogenous gammaretroviruses in frugivorous (Rousettus leschenaultii retrovirus, RlRV) and insectivorous (Megaderma lyra retrovirus, MlRV) bat species. Both genomes possess a large deletion in pol, indicating that they are defective retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places RlRV and MlRV within the diversity of mammalian gammaretroviruses, with the former falling closer to porcine endogenous retroviruses and the latter to Mus dunni endogenous virus, koala retrovirus and gibbon ape leukemia virus. Additional genomic mining suggests that both microbat (Myotis lucifugus) and megabat (Pteropus vampyrus) genomes harbour many copies of endogenous retroviral forms related to RlRV and MlRV. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of three genetically diverse groups of endogenous gammaretroviruses in bat genomes, with M. lucifugus possessing members of all three groups. Taken together, this study indicates that bats harbour distinct gammaretroviruses and may have played an important role as reservoir hosts during the diversification of mammalian gammaretroviruses.","Cui, Jie; Tachedjian, Gilda; Tachedjian, Mary; Holmes, Edward C; Zhang, Shuyi; Wang, Lin-Fa",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.043760-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22694899/,196

OBJECTIVES To identify predictors of adverse outcomes in patients hospitalised for exacerbation of COPD. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted in patients admitted for exacerbation of COPD. Demographic and clinical parameters were evaluated, including different multidimensional prognostic scores. Adverse outcomes included the following: death during hospitalisation or 1-month follow-up, intensive care unit admission, invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalisation (>11 days) and COPD-related emergency visit or readmission within 1 month after discharge. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS Of 155 patients included, an adverse outcome occurred in 69 (45%). Patients with an adverse outcome had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0.004) and more frequent exacerbations (p = 0.011), more frequently used oxygen at home (p = 0.042) and presented with lower pH (p < 0.001), lower ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (p = 0.006), higher arterial carbon dioxide pressure (p < 0.001) and a worse score on several prognostic indices at admission. Independent predictors of adverse outcome were exacerbation of COPD in the previous year [odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-9.9; p = 0.004], hypercapnia (odds ratio 9.4, 95% CI 3.7-23.6; p < 0.001) and hypoxaemia (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-12.6; p = 0.008). In the presence of all three characteristics, the probability of an adverse outcome was 95%, while hypercapnia was the strongest prognostic factor with a risk of 54%. CONCLUSIONS Patients with previous exacerbation of COPD, hypercapnia and hypoxaemia had the highest risk of an unfavourable evolution. The calculation of prognostic indices did not provide additional discriminative power.","Matkovic, Zinka; Huerta, Arturo; Soler, Nestor; Domingo, Rebeca; Gabarrús, Albert; Torres, Antoni; Miravitlles, Marc",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000335467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327370/,196

The formulated beverages were subjected to physical and physicochemical analysis, determination of total carotenoid, total flavonoid and total phenolic compound contents, as well as of their antioxidant activity (ABTS and FRAP method), organic acid, sugar and phenolic compound profile during 21 days of refrigeration storage (4 °C). Significant variations were found among formulated beverages for most of the measured parameters during storage. Beverages with xique-xique juice were less acidic (7.90-10.27 g/100 mL) than beverages without this juice (11.66-12.76 g/100 mL). Beverages with xique-xique juice had overall higher contents of bioactive compounds and higher antioxidant activity when compared to the control formulation. Beverages with the highest xique-xique juice concentrations had the highest contents of carotenoids (51.51-59.27 µg/100 mL), flavonoids (1.39-2.15 mg CE/100 mL), phenolic compounds (68.49-115.66 mg EGA/100 mL) and antioxidant activity, as measured by ABTS (0.71-0.84 µmol Trolox/mL) and FRAP (0.33-0.39 µmol Trolox/mL).

The Primer ID approach combined with the MiSeq platform overcomes the limitation of PCR errors and reveals the true sampling depth of population sequencing, making it an ideal tool to study mutagenic effects of potential broad-spectrum antivirals on RNA viruses. In this report we describe a protocol using Primer ID sequencing to study the mutations induced by antivirals in a coronavirus genome from an in vitro cell culture model and an in vivo mouse model. Viral RNA or total lung tissue RNA is tagged with Primer ID-containing cDNA primers during the initial reverse transcription step, followed by two rounds of PCR to amplify viral sequences and incorporate sequencing adaptors. Purified and pooled libraries are sequenced using the MiSeq platform. Sequencing data are processed using the template consensus sequence (TCS) web-app. The Primer ID approach provides an accurate sequencing protocol to measure mutation error rates in viral RNA genomes and host mRNA. Sequencing results suggested that β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) greatly increased the transition substitution rate but not the transversion substitution rate in the viral RNA genomes, and cytosine (C) to uridine (U) was found as the most frequently seen mutation.","Zhou, Shuntai; Hill, Collin S; Clark, Michael U; Sheahan, Timothy P; Baric, Ralph; Swanstrom, Ronald",Bio-protocol,https://doi.org/10.21769/bioprotoc.3938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796612/,196
162275,Hypogammaglobulinemia is a significant risk factor for mortality in patients with anca associated vasculitis and COVID-19,2021,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated to COVID-19, represents an emerging health threat worldwide as, after initial reports in China, it has continued to spread rapidly. The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, many patients can be asymptomatic, thus increasing the uncertainty of the diagnostic work-up. Laboratory tests play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the current gold standard being real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens. However, the diagnostic accuracy of rRT-PCR depends on many pre-analytical and analytical variables. The measurement of specific COVID-19 antibodies (both IgG and IgM) should serve as an additional, non-invasive tool for disease detection and management. Methods The imprecision of the MAGLUMI™ 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM and IgG assays (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) was assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A3 protocol. Linearity of dilution and recovery was evaluated by means of mixes of high-level pools and low-level pools of serum samples. Immunoglobulin time kinetics were evaluated using a series of serum samples, repeatedly collected from COVID-19-positive patients at different times, from <5 days up to 26-30 days. Results Findings at the analytical validation of the assay carried out according to the CLSI EP15-A3 guideline demonstrated that imprecision and repeatability were acceptable (repeatability was <4% and <6% for IgM and IgG, respectively, whilst intermediate imprecision was <6%). In addition, results of dilution and recovery studies were satisfactory. The kinetics of COVID-19 antibodies confirmed previously reported findings, showing a rapid increase of both IgM and IgG after 6-7 days from the symptom onset. IgG had 100% sensitivity on day 12, whilst 88% was the higher positive rate achieved for IgM after the same time interval. Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies. These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Padoan, Andrea; Cosma, Chiara; Sciacovelli, Laura; Faggian, Diego; Plebani, Mario",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301749/,196

The article was supported by research from Prof Henry J. Spooner, who had been researching and campaigning on the ill-effects of noise and its economic impact. The article sparked subsequent discussion and follow-up articles in the Daily Mail and its international partners. In an era of rapid technological change, that was on the cusp of implementing sound pressure measurements, the Daily Mail, in collaboration with the Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd, experimented with sound recording technology and commentary in the field to help communicate perceived loudness and identify the sources of ""unnecessary noise"". This resulted in the making of series of environmental sound recordings from five locations across central London during September 1928, the findings of which were documented and discussed in the Daily Mail at the time, and two recordings commercially released by Columbia on shellac gramophone disc. This was probably the first concerted anti-noise campaign of this type and scale, requiring huge technological efforts. The regulatory bodies and politicians of the time reviewed and improved the policies around urban noise shortly after the presentation of the recordings, which were also broadcast from the BBC both nationally and internationally, and many members of the public congratulated and thanked the Daily Mail for such an initiative. Despite its unpreceded scale and impact, and the recent scholarly attention on the history of anti-noise campaigning, this paper charts and contextualises the Daily Mail's London Street Noise campaign for the first time. As well as historical research, this data has also been used to start a longitudinal comparative study still underway, returning to make field recordings on the site on the 80th and 90th anniversaries and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and shared on the website londonstreetnoises.co.uk.","Drever, J.

The impact of such mutations in infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies are entirely unknown. Methods: We performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and determined the impact of the Lambda variant on infectivity and immune escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from two centers in Santiago, Chile who received the two-doses scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac. Results: We observed an increased infectivity mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the Alpha variant. Conclusions: Our results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac. These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines breakthrough.","Acevedo, M.

Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded trial of heterologous prime-boost immunization with CoronaVac and Convidecia in healthy adults 18-59 years of age. Eligible participants who were primed with one or two doses of CoronaVac were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive a booster dose of Convidecia or CoronaVac. Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the three-dose or two-dose regimen. The occurrences of adverse reactions within 28 days after the vaccination were documented. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured at 14 and 28 days after the booster vaccination. Results Between May 25 and 26, 2021, a total of 300 participants were enrolled. Participants who received a booster shot with a heterologous dose of Convidecia reported increased frequencies of solicited injection-site reactions than did those received a homogeneous dose of CoronaVac, but frequencies of systemic reactions. The adverse reactions were generally mild to moderate. The heterologous immunization with Convidecia induced higher live viral neutralizing antibodies than did the homogeneous immunization with CoronaVac (197.4[167.7, 232.4] vs. 33.6[28.3, 39.8] and 54.4[37. 9, 78.0] vs. 12.8[9.3, 17.5]) at day 14 in the three- and two-dose regimen cohort, respectively.

166110,Simultaneous arterial and venous thromboembolic events associated with COVID-19. A case report,2021,"What explains the variation in how states collectively deal with public health challenges across different regions? We tackle this puzzle by comparing the regional health governance efforts pursued within the Central American Integration System (SICA) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). We show that Central America's health governance has been driven by external actors, whereas South America's was driven by states within the region, and remained insulated from external actors’ influence. We argue that the explanation for such variation lies in the interplay of state capacity and regional leadership. In Central America, weak state capacity combined with the absence of a regional leader willing to provide governance resources. This opened up space for external actors to contribute actively to regional health governance, complementing the governance of Central American governments. In South America, Brazil's regional leadership mobilised neighbouring states’ capacities by promoting a South-South cooperation agenda based on intra-regional exchanges among national health bureaucracies, which, however, proved vulnerable to intergovernmental conflicts. Through the comparison of Central and South America, the article bridges the gap between global health governance scholarship and comparative regionalism, providing new insights on the determinants and effects of regional health governance modes in the Global South.","Agostinis, Giovanni Parthenay Kevin",Review of International Studies,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0260210521000206,196

The Rehab & Recovery team caring for those with serious mental illness were relocated to one floor of the much smaller Daleham Gardens. It was hypothesed by the authors that this would impact negatively on the already unhappy workforce.MethodThe same staff wellbeing survey was used as in in 2015 (following CQC's description of 'poor' morale), nearly 5 years on and following the site relocation. All clinical, managerial and administrative staff members were encouraged to participate by posting their survey anonymously in a make-shift postbox. Sweet treats were used to encourage participation within the busy team.ResultQualitative and quantitative data were collected from the team (response rate 44%). Exact tables will be shown but in summary;in the new building there was an increase in the number of staff who felt they could use initiative at work, make improvements at work, looked forward to going into work and felt enthusiastic about their job. Improvement cited were 'increased socials after work' and consequent 'wellbeing', in addition to 'good team atmosphere', 'good team work' and 'good relationships' in the new space. Further ideas were generated for additional improvements going forward.ConclusionWhilst caseloads and workloads are often cited as the cause of burnout, and indeed other changes in the 5 years could act as confounders, the design of work buildings is not to be underestimated. Contrary to what the authors had suspected, 'bigger' was not necessarily 'better' and a more condensed working environment made for greater togetherness amongst the team. In this age where economically desperate NHS trusts are forced to sell off their prized assets, observations that this is not always at the detriment of staff morale will provide some cause for optimism.","Waterhouse, Benjamin Attwood Ben",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.605,196

In order to determine the factors driving the acceptance of distance learning technologies and ensuring sustainable education, a model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology has been proposed and empirically validated with data collected from 550 in-service primary school teachers in Lithuania. Structural equation modelling technique with multi-group analysis was utilized to analyse the data. The results show that performance expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, effort expectancy, work engagement, and trust are factors that significantly affect teachers' behavioural intention to use distance learning technologies. The relationships in the model are moderated by pandemic anxiety and age of teachers. The results of this study provide important implications for education institutions, policy makers and designers: the predictors of intention to use distance learning technologies observed during the emergency period may serve as factors that should be strengthened in teachers' professional development, and the applicability of the findings is expanded beyond the pandemic isolation period. © 2021 Vilnius University.","Jevsikova, T.; Stupuriene, G.; Stumbriene, D.; Juškevičiene, A.; Dagiene, V.",Informatica (Netherlands),https://doi.org/10.15388/21-infor459,196

Therefore, proper region-specific pre-caution processes occupy a significant place to tackle with COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant data are cumulated and these data can be utilized in order to cope with pandemic efficiently via providing a better understanding for decision-makers. In the aforementioned aspect, data related to the COVID-19 pandemic is used to decide on group states where the application of the same pre-caution processes has become efficient and effective. Therefore, COVID-19 indicators (e.g. number of deaths and infected) can be utilized to cluster the states, regions, countries, etc. In order to accomplish the underlined objective, data with seven features (rate of one dose, rate of two doses, number of cases, death, tests, recovered people, and percentage of positive tests) are retrieved for each of 50 states in the USA. After that, a dissimilarity matrix for cities is generated with respect to the corresponding seven features. Lastly, clustering methods (K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical and BIRCH clustering, and P-median model) in literature are applied to gather clusters of states. In the proposed study, 50 states are taken into consideration and four different methods are applied to divide states into 6 subsets.

173460,A short delay in arthritis care is associated with higher disease activity-lessons from the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic,2021,"Lions (Panthera leo) in Africa have lost nearly half their population in just the last two decades, and effective management of the protected areas (PAs) where lions live will cost an estimated USD >$1 B/year in new funding. We explore the potential for launching a fire management and habitat restoration carbon-financing program to help fill this PA management funding gap. We demonstrate how introducing early dry season fire management programs could produce potential carbon revenues (PCR) from either a single carbon-financing method (avoided emissions) or from multiple sequestration methods of USD $59.6-$655.9 M/year (at USD $5/ton) or USD $155.0 M–$1.7 B/year (at USD $13/ton). We highlight variable but significant PCR for PAs with the greatest potential for restoring lion numbers between USD $1.5–$44.4 M per PA. We suggest investing in lion-centric fire management programs to jump-start the United Nations Decade of Ecological Restoration and help preserve African lions across their range. SCIENCE FOR SOCIETY The United Nation’s recently launched the Decade of Ecological Restoration in response to planet-wide land degradation. This study analyses the potential for savanna fire management programs to restore fire regimes that can generate new sources of revenue from carbon financing for chronically under-funded protected areas in Africa with lions, as lions are a key indicator of savanna ecosystem health. We estimated the amount of carbon saved by shifting fires that normally burn in the late dry season (and emit more carbon) to the early dry season (that accrue more carbon in the soil and woody vegetation). Based on current carbon market values we found substantial potential to eliminate or significantly reduce the $>1B annual funding gap needed to save the lion from extinction. Given additional benefits for nature and people from new savanna fire programs, we recommend integrated conservation and development projects direct more funding to some of the least developed countries with high biodiversity and support fire management programs in Africa.","Tear, Timothy H.; Wolff, Nicholas H.; Lipsett-Moore, Geoffrey J.; Ritchie, Mark E.; Ribeiro, Natasha S.; Petracca, Lisanne S.; Lindsey, Peter A.; Hunter, Luke; Loveridge, Andrew J.; Steinbruch, Franziska",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.132084,196

Understanding the nature, causes, and extent of these changes is essential to evaluate the pandemic's influence on commerce, transportation, employment, and environment, among others. However, existing studies mainly focus on changes to general human mobility patterns;few have investigated changes in specific human daily activities. Based on one-year longitudinal mobile phone positioning data for more than 31 million users in Beijing, we tracked intensity changes in two basic human daily activities, dwelling and working, over the stages of COVID-19. The results show that during COVID-19 outbreak, human working intensity decreased about 60% citywide, while dwelling intensity decreased about 40% in some work and education areas. After COVID-19 was under control, intensity in most regions has recovered, but that in schools, hotels, entertainment venues, and tourism areas has not. These intensity changes at regional scale are due to behavior changes at individual scale: about 43% of residents left Beijing before COVID-19, while only 16% have returned back;all commuters decreased their commuting times during COVID-19, while only 75% have reverted to normal. The findings reveal variations in human activities caused by COVID-19 that can support targeted urban management in the post-epidemic era. © 2021","Liu, Y.; Pei, T.; Song, C.; Chen, J.; Chen, X.; Huang, Q.; Wang, X.; Shu, H.; Guo, S.; Zhou, C.",Sustainable Cities and Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103206,196

Airborne virus transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor to the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many countries. Concerted research efforts in diverse scientific fields have meanwhile advanced the understanding of the physical principles of the manifold processes involved in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As part of these efforts, the physics and dynamics of aerosol filtration by various types of face masks have been studied. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic individual to a healthy individual, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic filtering of IAs by the imperfectly fitted face masks. Furthermore, we are able to show that the fit of the face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability if the infectious dose for virus transmission to the healthy person is in a critical range. We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it naturally encompasses the randomness of the transmission process and thus enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical averages. © 2021 ACM.","Lotter, S.; Brand, L.; Schäfer, M.; Schober, R.","8th ACM International Conference on Nanoscale Computing and Communication, NANOCOM 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3477206.3477478,196

Prior works, mostly from the field of mathematics, have investigated how this can be used in blended learning environments to help students. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most learning activities have shifted to online, motivating us to study and utilize students' use of an existing grading platform. Students were tasked to evaluate various degrees of erroneous answers as their learning opportunities, resembling program debugging. The grading process was engineered to supply feedback to students by revealing the actual marks and remarks to help them address their misconceptions and prepare them for an upcoming exam. This study presents our findings from clickstream data of students taking a synchronous online Computer Informatics class. How different students approached the activity was looked into: the amount of time spent and the difference of their assigned grade to that of a subject expert's. Although it is still inconclusive whether students learned from erroneous computer programs, we found that students who were proactive in seeking feedback had better midterm scores than those who were not.

However, within the current practices aiming for social inclusion of immigrants, there has been an underlying assumption that immigrants are permanent “recipients” of their host society’s support, rather than potential “hosts” with abilities to support others in their society in the long-term. To question that assumption, this paper aims to identify immigrants’ degree of involvement by taking a multiethnic community farm in Toronto, Canada, as a case study to discuss the scope of the long-term inclusion of immigrants. Conducting a set of 15 life story interviews with participants of the Black Creek Community Farm (BCCF), the study identified what roles immigrants played within the group using the longitudinal analysis of individuals’ role-taking processes between 2010–2018. The paper identified three types of roles—recipient, assistant, and facilitator—taken by the participants during their involvement. The timeline of individual role types by year showed that more than half of the immigrants at the BCCF underwent a “role shift” to take an assistant and facilitator role that required higher engagement. The findings suggest immigrants’ orientations towards the BCCF have shifted from being the ones to be included to the ones including others in the local community over time, which confirms our hypothesis.","Bessho, Akane Terada Toru Yokohari Makoto",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12198283,196
180055,Osteoarthritis pain and COVID-19 pandemic: The lockdown impact,2021,"Among the several disabling features following a stroke, the unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is one of the most frequently present in case of right-sided lesions. The standard assessment of such a pathology happens via tests that are usually performed on paper. However, a great interest toward digital solutions for USN is arising, in order to facilitate the activities of medical specialists. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 is stressing the importance of remote assistive tools which enable the continuity of care at patient's home. Indeed, connected technology allows for remote monitoring of patients by the clinical staff, hence enabling the definition of a personalized plan of care even after the de-hospitalization and in safe conditions. In addition, USN patients are among the so-called fragile subjects who, due to their condition, require continuous monitoring and rehabilitative therapeutic intervention, which can be granted by some ICT solution. The present work introduces the battery of tests for the assessment of USN which are included in the ReMoVES system. They are digital versions of standard tests that can be practiced via a touchscreen. The informative content that such activities deliver is wider and more comprehensive than the paper based versions. The experimental phase is described with respect to the well-known Albert's test, in a real-life scenario. The indicators that can be computed are here defined and described.","Ferraro, F.; Trombini, M.; Truffelli, R.; Simonini, M.; Dellepiane, S.; Ieee,",2021 10th International Ieee/Embs Conference on Neural Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ner49283.2021.9441471,196

The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention measures to control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the Lévy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely, ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises. Our work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of epidemics.

The ancient Roman model of dictatorship suggests that any legal framework for responding to an emergency has two components: dealing effectively with the threat and preventing abuse. How can these goals best be secured in a pandemic? Within the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, it become readily apparent that it posed two kinds of threat. First, it posed a mortal threat to individual and public health arising from a deadly virus that could be transmitted relatively easily through everyday social activities. Second, the efforts of governments to contain its spread inevitably led to a secondary danger as social and economic life was shuttered-the danger of social and political unrest. The chapter considers two dimensions of the governmental response: the formal legal structure under which that response operates and the dynamics of expertise, trust, and responsiveness to feedback that it potentially fosters-or inhibits. It argues that the goal of returning to normal is best served when these two dimensions-the legal framework and the expertise-feedback dynamic-are aligned to enable the society to respond effectively and fairly. © the several contributors 2021.","Ramraj, V.

Also, residents from the West experienced higher food insecurity levels relative to the Mid-West between 2015 and 2018. The analysis also revealed that race is not a determining factor of food insecurity as both White and Black are equally affected to a significant level. Rather, the most salient determinant of food insecurity is poverty. The effects of poverty were positive and strongly significant from 2015 through 2018. The effect was, however, mild in 2020 probably due to the stimulus and unemployment checks people received through the Care Act. This result underscored the importance of SNAP and other government intervention programs in addressing the country's food insecurity problems.","Yeboah, O.; Shaik, S.; Musah, J.",Agricultural Sciences,https://doi.org/10.4236/as.2021.124027,196

Methods 69 BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and 55 AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) vaccinees without previous infection or immunosuppressive medication were included. Anti-body levels were quantified 3 weeks after dose 1, in case of AZD1222 directly before boostering (11 weeks after dose 1) and 3 weeks after dose 2, with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 S total antibody assay. Results Pre-booster (BNT162b2: 80.6 [25.5-167.0] BAU/mL, AZD1222: 56.4 [36.4-104.8] BAU/mL, not significant) and post-booster levels (BNT162b2: 2,092.0 [1,216.3-4,431.8] BAU/mL, AZD1222: 957.0 [684.5-1,684.8] BAU/mL, p<0.0001) correlated well in BNT162b2 ({rho}=0.53) but not in AZD1222 recipients. Moreover, antibody levels after the first dose of BNT162b2 correlated inversely with age ({rho}=-0.33, P=0.013), whereas a positive correlation with age was observed after the second dose in AZD1222 recipients ({rho}=0.26, P=0.030). Conclusions In conclusion, our data suggest that antibody levels quantified by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 S assay before the booster shot could infer post-booster responses to BNT162b2, but not to AZ1222.

Our research shows that community lockdowns are effective only if the links outside of the communities are virtually completely sealed off. The benefits of targeting specifically these links, as opposed to links uniformly at random across the whole network, are inferable only beyond 90% lockdown effectiveness. And even then the peak of the infected curve decreases by only 20% and its onset is delayed by a factor of 1.5. This holds for static and temporal social networks, regardless of their size and structural particularities. Networks derived from cell phone location data and online location-based social platforms yield the same results as a large family of hyperbolic geometric network models where characteristic path lengths, clustering, and community structure can be arbitrarily adjusted. The complex connectedness of modern human societies, which enables the ease of global communication and the lightning speeds at which news and information spread, thus makes it very difficult to halt epidemic spreading with top-down measures.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on PGC-1α and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) as well its likely hepato toxicity in male Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=10/group) and treated orally with water (0.2ml - group 1) or selenium (25µg/day -group 2; 50µg/day - group 3) for 28 and 56days, respectively. Thereafter, blood samples were collected and estimated for glucose, alkaline-phosphate (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aspartate-aminotransferase (AST). Liver homogenates were analyzed for PGC-1α and G6Pase activity. Significant dose-dependent increases in blood glucose, hepatic PGC-1α and G6Pase activities were observed on days 28 and 56 in selenium groups compared to group 1. Serum GGT activity increased in both selenium groups on day 28 however, on day 56 values in group 2 were reduced and increased in group 3, respectively. Compared to control ALP reduced in selenium groups while AST was not significantly different. This study suggests that selenium supplementation increases hepatic peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma-coactivator-1α and glucose-6-phosphatase activity leading to a likely increase in hepatic glucose output. It also shows that though selenium supplementation at the doses used maybe nontoxic to hepatocytes, it may however exert potential toxicity on the biliary tract.","Ige, Abayomi O; Fatokun, B P; Emediong, I E; Odetola, A O; Adele, Bernard O; Adewoye, Elsie O",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084620/,196

Therefore, alternative assay methods such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR have been pursued for routine testing, primarily to resolve probable cases. We report here a modification of standard DNA sequencing technology for accurate identification of SARS-CoV in routine testing. Instead of requiring the sequencing of the whole SARS-CoV genome, our modification enables the simultaneous sequencing of three regions of the SARS-CoV genome, the spike protein-encoding gene (35 nucleotides), gene M (43 nucleotides), and gene N (45 nucleotides), in a single electropherogram.

RESULTS Overall, 6513 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily number of patients visiting the ED for acute trauma declined by 40% compared to the average in previous months (P < 0.01). A strong negative correlation was found between the number of trauma-related ED visits and the log number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Israel (Pearson's r = -0.63, P < 0.01). In the COVID-19 period there was a significant change in the proportion of elderly patients (7% increase, P = 0.002), admissions ratio (12% increase, P < 0.001), and patients brought by emergency medical services (10% increase, P < 0.001). The number of motor vehicle accident related injury declined by 45% (P < 0.01).

194014,Depression: a common but underrecognized condition associated with end-stage renal disease.,2004,"Open and laparoscopic hernia surgery continues to evolve with new products allowing surgeons multiple choices in treating their patients. The evolution towards tension-free techniques in dealing with hernias requires that today's surgeons know the options available in meshes as well as fixation methods in order to have the best outcomes. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion in the number of meshes available. Currently, there are numerous uncoated, coated, and biologic meshes in production that can be used in hernia repair. This paper will focus on the latest developments in coated meshes that allow for intra-abdominal placement as well as the different types of biologic meshes and their typical uses. Tacking devices for laparoscopic hernia repair now come in titanium as well as absorbable devices. AbsorbaTack™ (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) and Sorbafix™ (Davol, Warwick, RI) are two of the newest absorbable tacking devices thought to possibly benefit patients with decreased pain and long-term complications as compared with their titanium counterparts. Adhesives continue to be used more and more for hernia repair, especially in inguinal and paraesophageal hernia repairs. Tissucol™/Tisseel™ (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and Evicel™ (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) are two types of fibrin glues that are available for use in hernia repair. Practitioners using these biologic adhesives think there is less pain compared with tacking.","Powell, Benjamin S; Voeller, Guy R",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21082565/,196
194469,Exercise and chronic kidney disease: current recommendations.,2005,"To effectively reduce health risks at the animal-human-ecosystems interface, a One Health strategy is crucially important to create strong national and regional animal health systems that are well coordinated with strong public health systems. Animal diseases, particularly those caused by new and emerging zoonotic pathogens, must be effectively controlled at their source to reduce their potentially devastating impact upon both animal and human health. As the international organisation responsible for developing standards, guidelines and recommendations for animal health, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) plays an important role in minimising animal and public health risks attributable to zoonoses and other animal diseases, which can have severe consequences for global food safety and security. National Veterinary Services, which implement OIE animal health and welfare standards and other measures, are the first line of defence against these diseases, and must have the capacity to meet the core requirements necessary for their diagnosis and control. The OIE works collaboratively with the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to improve the ability of national animal and public health systems to respond to current and emerging animal health risks with public health consequences. In addition to improving and aligning national laboratory capacities in high-risk areas, the OIE collaborates on One Health-oriented projects for key diseases, establishing model frameworks which can be applied to manage other existing and emerging priority diseases. This article reviews the role and activities of the OIE in strengthening the national Veterinary Services of its Member Countries for a more effective and sustainable One Health collaboration.","Corning, S",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25707190/,196
198201,Synergism between allergens and viruses and risk of hospital admission with asthma: case-control study.,2002,"Point of care testing (POCT) represents an important step forward in the clinical management of patients. POC assays are easy to use and do not require skilled personnel; therefore they are particularly useful in low resource settings where diagnostics laboratories equipped with complex instruments that require well trained technicians are not available. Samples can be processed immediately overcoming the problems related to the stability of the sample, storage and shipping to a centralized laboratory hospital based. Furthermore, results are delivered in real-time, usually less than 1 hr; thus, a clinical decision can be taken earlier. A prompt diagnosis is crucial in the case of contagious diseases allowing a rapid isolation of the infected patient and treatment; thus, reducing the risk of transmission of the pathogen. In this report, we address the use of POC assays in the diagnosis of infectious pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, human papillomavirus, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhea, trichomonas vaginalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis and the parasite plasmodium. These pathogens are commonly detected among vulnerable people such as refugees and migrants. The described POC assays are based on nuclei acid amplification technology (NAAT) that is generally characterized by a high sensitivity and specificity.","Bernardini, Sergio; Pieri, Massimo; Ciotti, Marco",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421489/,196

Concurrent infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) did not affect the responses to dietary antigens at weaning, nor did it affect the subsequent development of tolerance. However, TGEV infection did enhance the primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1, but not IgG2, antibody responses to injected soy in comparison to those of uninfected animals. Paradoxically, TGEV-infected animals showed an enhanced primary IgG1 antibody response to injected soy at 4 weeks of age, but they subsequently showed a reduced secondary response after an intraperitoneal challenge at 9 weeks of age in comparison to uninfected animals. The results suggest that an enteric virus, either used as a vaccine vector or present as a subclinical infection, may not have significant effects on the development of dietary allergies but may have effects both on the primary response and on the subsequent recall response to systemic antigens to which the animal is exposed concurrently with virus antigens.","Bailey, Michael; Haverson, Karin; Miller, Bevis; Jones, Philip; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Stokes, Christopher R",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15013985/,196

In the present report, 36 patients with RA treated with azathioprine (group I) and 49 age-matched patients with RA (group II), were studied to detect potential early markers of malignancy. Chest x-rays were similar to both groups. One patient in group I had a positive PAP smear and was subsequently found to have uterine carcinoma. Alpha-fetoprotein was positive in one patient in group I and none in group II. CEA was negative in all patients in group I, but positive in seven in group II. On chromosomal analysis group I showed a greater frequency of breakage. Group I showed lower serum folates and a highly significant number of megaloblastic features in marrow aspirates. In group I seven tumours, three being malignant, occurred while taking azathioprine, and in group II six tumours, one malignant, were identified (p = 0.17).

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of lower respiratory infection in children, whereas viral pathogens dominate as a more common cause of lower respiratory infection illness in infants and children overall. The diagnosis and clinical management of lower respiratory infections pose challenges to pediatric health providers as new technology is developed and new pathogens emerge in the spectrum of clinical disease. RECENT FINDINGS Human metapneumovirus is now recognized as a cause of lower respiratory infection disease in children, and coronavirus has been linked to epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Respiratory syncytial virus continues to be a major source of viral lower respiratory infection illness in children and can lead to childhood asthma. Treatment for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis depends largely on the severity of disease and the course of clinical symptoms. The diagnosis of bacterial lower respiratory infection disease remains a clinical challenge, but new methods to detect S. pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae may facilitate the clinical management of these illnesses. As immunization against S. pneumoniae becomes more widely used, the complications of bacterial lower respiratory infections will diminish markedly. SUMMARY Future progress in the clinical management of lower respiratory infection diseases will entail improved methods of early diagnosis, broader options for treatment, and better defined clinical parameters for triage and follow-up of children with lower respiratory infections.","Klig, Jean E",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14758123/,196

Although it is common practice for patients to be transferred between provinces for specialist care, the upsurge in the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some hospitals considering reserving intensive care and critical care beds for COVID-19 patients from their province. The Constitution provides that nobody may be refused emergency medical treatment, nor may they be unfairly discriminated against. This is also implicit in the 'equitable' provision of healthcare services referred to in the National Health Act 61 of 2003. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa COVID-19 guidelines, or other similar widely accepted guidelines, may be used, provided they do not unfairly discriminate against patients on the basis of age. According to the Constitution, a hospital that wishes to turn away an emergency treatment request from another province because it is reserving beds for COVID-19 patients from its home province will have to show that it is 'reasonable and justifiable' to do so. It will have to show that the other province's patient was being subjected to the same criteria for admission as its home province COVID-19 patients, because, for instance, occupation of the bed by another COVID-19 patient from the home province was imminent.","McQuoid-Mason, D J",S Afr Med J,,196
203944,COVID-19-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: Learning from the First Wave,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nurses are considered important healthcare professionals during the management of the pandemic process due to the considerable amount of time they spend in the face-to-face nursing of infected patients. To optimise the service of healthcare workers, it is recommended that the mental health needs of the health workforce are addressed. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the experiences and coping strategies of Turkish nurses working in pandemic units. METHODS: A grounded theory design was applied. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 nurses. The data were analysed according to the constant comparative method. RESULTS: The study generated a core category ('It was difficult working in the unknown, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength'), showing that all nurses felt heroic via the satisfaction of touching patients' lives and uncertain. Four main categories emerged: being caught in the pandemic, empowerment for coping with the struggle, challenges during the coping process and effects of the pandemic on life. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses felt that their profession was sacred and valued by society, and comprehensive support had facilitated the process. Nurses had difficulty in managing their fear of infecting others and adapting to many new elements, the learning process and a lack of understanding of their role as team members. The nurses attending to the pandemic have experienced the effects of COVID-19 on their lives, such as psychological growth, psychological symptoms and being labelled as high risk. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses would be further empowered by government and society's support and acceptance of professionalism in nursing. The findings suggest that the resources for the psychological support of nurses in the pandemic should be increased. Regular and intensive training for nursing is necessary to promote adaptation and efficacy in crisis management.","Deliktas Demirci, Ayse; Oruc, Mine; Kabukcuoglu, Kamile",J. clin. nurs,,196

In the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, multiple RT-PCR-based tests were developed to screen for viral infection. As an emergency response to increasing testing demand, we established a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR diagnostics platform for which we compared different commercial and in-house RT-PCR protocols. Four commercial, one customized, and one in-house RT-PCR protocols were evaluated with 92 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 92 SARS-CoV-2-negative samples. Furthermore, economical and practical characteristics of these protocols were compared. In addition, a highly sensitive digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) method was developed, and application of RT-PCR and ddPCR methods on SARS-CoV-2 environmental samples was examined. Very low limits of detection (1 or 2 viral copies/µL), high sensitivities (93.6% to 97.8%), and high specificities (98.7% to 100%) for the tested RT-PCR protocols were found. Furthermore, the feasibility of downscaling two of the commercial protocols, which could optimize testing capacity, was demonstrated. Tested commercial and customized RT-PCR detection kits show very good and comparable sensitivity and specificity, and the kits could be further optimized for use on SARS-CoV-2 viral samples derived from human and surface swabbed samples.","Tastanova, Aizhan; Stoffel, Corinne Isabelle; Dzung, Andreas; Cheng, Phil Fang; Bellini, Elisa; Johansen, Pål; Duda, Agathe; Nobbe, Stephan; Lienhard, Reto; Bosshard, Philipp Peter; Levesque, Mitchell Paul",J. mol. diagn,,196

We sought to model airborne infection transmission risk assuming five realistic exposure scenarios using previously estimated outdoor airflow rates for 12 New York City nail salons, a published quanta generation rate specific to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Wells-Riley equation to assess risk under both steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. Additionally, the impact of face mask-wearing by occupants on airborne infection transmission risk was also evaluated. The risk of airborne infection transmission across all salons and all exposure scenarios when not wearing face masks ranged from <0.015% to 99.25%, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 24.77%. Wearing face masks reduced airborne infection transmission risk to between <0.01% and 51.96%, depending on the salon, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 7.30% across all salons. Increased outdoor airflow rates in nail salons were generally strongly correlated with decreased average airborne infection transmission risk. The results of this study indicate that increased outdoor airflow rates and the use of face masks by both employees and customers could substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City nail salons. Businesses should utilize multiple layers of infection control measures (e.g. social distancing, face masks, and outdoor airflow) to reduce airborne infection transmission risk for both employees and customers.","Harrichandra, Amelia; Ierardi, A Michael; Pavilonis, Brian",Toxicol Ind Health,,196

Along with the non-therapeutic preventive measurements, scientific efforts are currently focused, mainly, on the development of vaccines and pharmacological treatment with existing drugs. Summarizing evidences from scientific literatures on the discovery of treatment plan of COVID-19 under a platform would help the scientific community to explore the opportunities in a systematic fashion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the potential drugs and biomedical entities related to coronavirus related diseases, including COVID-19, that are mentioned on scientific literature through an automated computational approach. METHODS: We mined the information from publicly available scientific literature and related public resources. Six topic-specific dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, diseases, Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, were integrated to mine all scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning. We also applied the concept of cosine similarity to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes. RESULTS: Based on the literature mining, we identified 1805 diseases, 2454 drugs, 1910 genes that are related to coronavirus related diseases including COVID-19. Integrating the extracted information, we developed the first knowledgebase platform dedicated to COVID-19, which highlights potential list of drugs and related biomedical entities. For COVID-19, we highlighted multiple case studies on existing drugs along with a confidence score for their applicability in the treatment plan. Based on our computational method, we found Remdesivir, Statins, Dexamethasone, and Ivermectin could be considered as potential effective drugs to improve clinical status and lower mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also found that Hydroxychloroquine could not be considered as an effective drug for COVID-19. The resulting knowledgebase is made available as an open source tool, named COVID-19Base. CONCLUSIONS: Proper investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified interactions among those would help the research community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Khan, Junaed Younus; Khondaker, Md Tawkat Islam; Hoque, Iram Tazim; Al-Absi, Hamada R H; Rahman, Mohammad Saifur; Guler, Reto; Alam, Tanvir; Rahman, M Sohel",JMIR Med Inform,,196

Although researchers have performed studies across the world to evaluate the interaction between DM and COVID-19 with a specific focus on DM as a predictor or determinant for COVID-19, these studies are not synthesized collectively to provide stronger evidence. Hence we aimed to review the studies that have assessed whether diabetes is a predictor or determinants for morbidity and death among patients with COVID-19. Different articles were searched from databases such as Google Scholar and PubMed. We undertook a narrative review of full-text research articles that were published in the English language both in developed and develop-ing countries, with a specific focus on diabetes and COVID-19. All primary research articles were examined for information pertinent to the objective. We also reviewed all references of the eligible article to avoid missing any article relevant to the topic of interest. The existing evidence suggests that diabetic patients are at increased risk for adverse outcomes including death from COVID-19. The syn-thesis of the review revealed that evidence regarding diabetes as a predictor or determinants for morbidity and death among patients with COVID-19 is mixed. Individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections such as COVID-19. Thus, most of the studies have identified DM as a predictor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. In contrast, there are very few studies that reported contrary findings. Individuals with DM are at higher risk of catching infections such as COVID-19. This risk can be decreased, though not eradicated, by maintaining optimum levels of glucose in the blood. Indeed, diabetes was an important predictor for morbidity and death among patients with COVID-19. Therefore, these patients should take extra precautionary measures with good glycemic control and frequent monitoring of blood glucose.","Aldossari, Khaled K.",J. Endocrinol. Metab.,,196

217056,Cardiac arrest in COVID-19 myocarditis: a case report,2021,"Nowadays, the global spreading of hazardous heavy metals becomes a top-priority environmental challenge, owing to its serious detrimental health outcomes. Herein, a novel cysteine-doped polyaniline@faujasite hybrid composite (Cys-PANi@FAU-50) was synthesized via a facile in-situ polymerization route for the effective detoxification of Cr(VI)-bearing wastewaters. The Cys-PANi@FAU-50 composite displayed an open mesoporous structure richly decorated with nitrogen/oxygen-containing functional groups, which consequently boosted the diffusion, adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI) oxyanions. The Cr(VI) adsorption behavior was satisfactorily tailored via pseudo-second-order law and Langmuir model with a maximum uptake capacity of 384.6 mg/g. Based on the advanced statistical physics theory, the monolayer model with two distinct receptor sites provided a reliable microscopic and macroscopic prediction of the Cr(VI) adsorption process. Stereographically, the Cr(VI) ions were adsorbed through horizontal multi-anchorage and vertical multi-molecular mechanisms on the amine and hydroxyl groups of Cys-PANi@FAU-50, respectively. The thermodynamic functions evidenced that the Cr(VI) adsorption was an endothermic spontaneous process.

This article first examines the implications of the incompatible aims of universities: performing well based on rankings while espousing commitments to equity and anti-oppressive practices. Second, this article proposes co-operatives as a strategy for developing a more equitable and resilient post-secondary education sector. The assumption underpinning this proposal is that without structural changes to higher education, COVID-19 will amplify an already inequitable distribution of resources and lessen the ability of universities to play a responsible role in expanding public debate and increasing understanding of critical issues facing the planet. Co-operatives could be an effective way for the sector to engage with the need to radically alter how we interact with each other and the natural world, both now and beyond the pandemic.","Stack, Michelle",Int Rev Educ,,196

221517,Pneumopericardium following mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a pandemic. However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 µg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 µg/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Kikuchi, Akiko; Nagatomi, Ryoichi",Tohoku J Exp Med,,196

222034,"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a case report",2020,"Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (&#8805;60% ethanol or &#8805;70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis.","Yip, Luke; Bixler, Danae; Brooks, Daniel E; Clarke, Kevin R; Datta, S Deblina; Dudley, Steven; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Lind, Jennifer N; Mayette, Annaliese; Melgar, Michael; Pindyck, Talia; Schmit, Kristine M; Seifert, Steven A; Shirazi, Farshad Mazda; Smolinske, Susan C; Warrick, Brandon J; Chang, Arthur",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,196
222342,"The administration of low molecular weight heparin in severe case of COVID-19, a case report",2020,"The existing knowledge is insufficient to explain some infection events of SARS-CoV-2, and new ideas about the transmission modes may be needed. The present study proposes that the RNAs of this virus might be infectious and that the transmission of these RNAs might be one route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. I speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are infectious based on the following rationale and offer a putative mechanism: RNA is the most important biomolecule of the novel coronavirus for expression and replication, free RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to remain suspended in the air and retain their biological activity, and some exogenous RNAs can enter the host cell after contact. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. It is worthwhile to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 components (e.g., virus particles, positive RNA strands, negative RNA strands, and virus proteins) with symptoms to study the mechanism of asymptomatic infection. If additional detection results show that the proportion of RNA in the environment is higher than the proportion of RNA in the novel coronavirus particles, this would suggest the potential presence of free RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Research on the temporal and spatial distribution of infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA strands is necessary. The nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 should target not only positive RNA strands but also negative RNA strands. For medical purposes, studying environmental RNAs (eRNAs) is important. I believe that further investigation of the infection capabilities of viral RNAs will yield useful information.","Xu, Zhongneng",J Infect Dev Ctries,,196
222360,Insulin Resistance is Associated with Subclinical Vascular Injury in Patients with Kidney Disease,2020,"Stratifying factors, like age and gender, can modify the effect of treatments and exposures on risk of a studied outcome. Several effect measures, including the relative risk, hazard ratio, odds ratio, and risk difference, can be used to measure this modification. It is known that choice of effect measure may determine the presence and direction of effect-measure modification. We show that considering the opposite outcome -- for example, recovery instead of death -- may similarly influence effect-measure modification. In fact, if the relative risk for the studied outcome and the relative risk for the opposite outcome agree about the direction of effect-measure modification, then so will the two cumulative hazard ratios, the risk difference, and the odds ratio. When risks are randomly sampled from the uniform (0,1) distribution, the probability of this happening is 5/6. Disagreement is probable enough that researchers considering one relative risk should also consider the other and further discussion if they disagree. (If possible, researchers should also report estimated risks.)

Although the mortality rate is reported to be high after surgery in patients with COVID-19, cesarean delivery was successfully performed under regional anesthesia in most cases and postoperative course was favorable both in the parents and newborns. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in a newborn two hours after delivery from a pregnant woman with COVID-19, based on the increased immunoglobulin levels and deranged liver function, suggesting that its possibility cannot be completely eliminated.

224047,COVID-19-Associated Acute Kidney Injury and Quantified Protein Catabolic Rate: A Likely Effect of Cytokine Storm on Muscle Protein Breakdown,2020,"Introduction and Background: The novel coronavirus or commonly referred to as the covid-19, has been a threat to the global health as well as the world economy. It all started from the Wuhan city of china in December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia cases with severe acute respiratory symptoms were reported with unknown etiology, majority of cases linked to the exposure to wholesale seafood market in Hunan. On January 7th, after the nomenclature of this causative agent was done as Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID19, the struggles to combat and try to control this illness have only so far been less helpful as more and more countries have exponential proportion of cases. On the other side of the illness are the efforts being done constantly to study the characteristics of the virus, newer treatment agents, expanding testing facilities and finally to find a vaccine as soon as possible. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two beta corona viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20-24 have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the beta coronavirus. Four viruses — (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection. Although asymptomatic infected can also be a source. Transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact (defined as that within 1m distance and lasting for several minutes). A possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations has also not been denied as of yet. Since the information regarding the illness, the treatment principles have been in constant scrutiny and have been changed dynamically as we get to know more about the virus, studies of covid19 cases would be a major stepping stone in acquiring maximum if not hundred percent knowledge about covid19. Materials and Methods: An observational retrospective case study was done for a fixed duration of a month i.e from 23/05/2020 to 23/06/2020. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included under the study. Inclusion criteria: 1. Age >40yrs with symptoms of severe acute respiratory Illness (screened as per the symptom suggestive of acute respiratory illness, mohfw.gov.in) 2. Asymptomatic aged >40yrs with comorbidities and in direct contact with confirmed cases of covid19. Exclusion criteria: 1. Immunocompromised patients. 2. Pregnant patients. 3. Autoimmune disease patients 4. History of psychiatric illness. The patients were isolated in different wards based on the presence or absence and severity of symptoms. Detailed history, general and systemic examination and investigations were done. Samples of throat and nasal swab were sent for RT-PCR assay of covid19 testing done by Real time reverse transcriptase based PCR. Regular monitoring of patients was done. Treatment given based on the most recent guidelines update by the ICMR and made available by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Statistical Analysis: Data was analysed by using SPSS 22.0 (trial version) software and T test, Chi-square Pierson’s correlation and other appropriate statistical test will be used to analyse the data. Aims & Objectives: To understand the symptomatology, disease course and complications of covid19. To study the changes in laboratory parameters in association with severity of illness. To study the effect of presence of comorbidities with respect to the outcome of covid19 Ethical Considerations: Since it being a retrospective observational study, complete patient confidentiality was being maintained whil collecting and analysing the data as well as during the tabulation of the results. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

235299,Treatment Guidance for Patients With Lung Cancer During the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: About 30% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had persisting lung abnormalities after acute illness. However, little is known whether SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will cause long-term pulmonary complications. We present our experience with a patient with a new diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) during the pandemic. Case: A 61-year-old man with history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea developed acute onset cough and dyspnea in March 2020. The patient was not initially tested for COVID-19 because of the local department of public health's stay-at-home advisory. Cough resolved but dyspnea persisted. Two months later, polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 was checked and was negative. Due to ongoing dyspnea, a CT chest was performed 5 months after symptom onset and showed diffuse, mild sub-pleural reticulonodular opacities in upper and lower lungs, concerning for ILD (Figure 1). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) showed normal spirometry and lung volumes, and mild impairment in gas exchange. Work up for causes of ILD, including assessment for exposures and serologies for rheumatologic disease, was unremarkable. IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 was detected (25.9 AU/ml;normal&lt;1.00 AU/ml);IgM was undetectable. Work up for other causes of dyspnea included an echocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiogram, and ventilation-perfusion scan that revealed no evidence of structural heart disease or thromboembolic disease. Discussion: Given no other etiology of ILD was identified, it is most plausible that our patient had acute COVID-19 infection in March and developed secondary ILD over the ensuing months. Previous studies of patients with SARS and MERS have found occurrences of pulmonary fibrosis and PFT abnormalities persisting many months after onset of infection. Thus, it is prudent to be vigilant for symptoms of lung disease in patients with a known history of COVID-19 infection. An additional diagnostic challenge, as with the case above, lies with patients who present with new onset ILD but without a confirmation of COVID-19, particularly given the limited access to testing in the early stages of the pandemic. In these patients, we suggest a thorough history that includes screening for symptoms suggestive of prior viral syndromes, particularly with associated anosmia or dysgeusia, that can point to a history of COVID-19 infection. Another option is consideration of serologic testing, although such tests must be interpreted with caution in view of the paucity of supporting evidence and the possibility of both false-positives and false-negatives.","Stuewe, E.; Kher, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,196

237237,A lesson from a saboteur: high-MW kininogen impact in coronavirus-induced disease 2019. (Special Issue: The pharmacology of COVID-19.),2020,"Objective: Altered coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients is associated with a poor prognosis. We tested whether COVID-19 patients on chronic oral anticoagulants (cOACs) for thromboembolism prophylaxis could receive protection from developing more severe phenotypes of the disease. Approach and Results: We searched the database of the SARS-RAS study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04331574), a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy designed by the Italian Society of Hypertension. The database counts 2,377 charts of Italian COVID-19 patients in 26 hospitals. We calculated the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), which is associated with death in COVID-19 patients. In our population (n = 2,377, age 68.2 ± 0.4 years, CCI: 3.04 ± 0.04), we confirm that CCI is associated with increased mortality [OR: 1.756 (1.628-1.894)], admission to intensive care units [ICU;OR: 1.074 (1.017-1.134)], and combined hard events [CHE;OR: 1.277 (1.215-1.342)]. One hundred twenty-five patients were on cOACs (age: 79.3 ± 0.9 years, CCI: 4.35 ± 0.13);despite the higher CCI, cOACs patients presented with a lower risk of admissions to the ICU [OR 0.469 (0.250-0.880)] but not of death [OR: 1.306 (0.78-2.188)] or CHE [OR: 0.843 (0.541-1.312)]. In multivariable logistic regression, cOACs confirmed their protective effect on ICU admission and CHE. The CCI remains the most important risk factor for ICU admission, death, and CHE. Conclusions: Our data support a mechanism for the continuation of cOAC therapy after hospital admission for those patients who are on chronic treatment. Our preliminary results suggest the prophylactic use of direct cOACs in patients with elevated CCI score at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic even in absence of other risks of thromboembolism.","Iaccarino, G.; Grassi, G.; Borghi, C.; Grassi, D.; Mancusi, C.; Muiesan, M.

The speed of the viral spread results in a tsunami of patients, which begs for a reliable screening tool using readily available data to predict disease progression. Methods: Multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed to develop and validate a triage model. Patient demographic and non-laboratory clinical data were recorded. Using only the data from Zhongnan Hospital, step-wise multivariable logistic regression was performed, and a prognostic nomogram was constructed based on the independent variables identifies. The discrimination and calibration of the model were validated. External independent validation was performed to further address the utility of this model using data from Jinyintan Hospital. Results: A total of 716 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Zhongnan Hospital were included for model construction. Men, increased age, fever, hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, dyspnea, cough, and myalgia are independent risk factors for disease progression. External independent validation was carried out in a cohort with 201 cases from Jinyintan Hospital. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.787 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.747-0.827) in the training group and 0.704 (95% CI: 0.632-0.777) in the validation group. Conclusions: We developed a novel triage model based on basic and clinical data. Our model could be used as a pragmatic screening aid to allow for cost efficient screening to be carried out such as over the phone, which may reduce disease propagation through limiting unnecessary contact. This may help allocation of limited medical resources.","Tu, Yuexing; Zhou, Xianlong; Shao, Lina; Zheng, Jiayin; Wang, Jiafeng; Wang, Yixin; Tong, Weiwei; Wang, Mingshan; Wu, Jia; Zhu, Junpeng; Yan, Rong; Ji, Yemin; Chen, Legao; Zhu, Di; Wang, Huafang; Chen, Sheng; Liu, Renyang; Lin, Jingyang; Zhang, Jun; Huang, Haijun; Zhao, Yan; Ge, Minghua",Front Public Health,,196
237858,COVID-19 in hospitalized liver transplant recipients: An early systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pneumonic disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the 7th Coronavirus to have successfully infected and caused an outbreak in humans. Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses, including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.","Low, Zheng Yao; Yip, Ashley Jia Wen; Sharma, Anshika; Lal, Sunil K",Virus genes,,196

Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20-30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID-19-associated ARDS Findings from autopsy studies have influenced therapy and prophylaxis","Lax, S.

It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance in order to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions for this promising and important domain are elucidated and discussed.","Zhao, Liang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09815v3.pdf,196

If a COVID-19 vaccine were to be designated an essential medicine by the World Health Organization, this would invoke special ""core"" human rights duties for governments to provide the vaccine as a matter of priority irrespective of resource constraints. States would also have duties to make the vaccine available in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality and adequate information, and at an affordable price. This question is especially critical and unique given that COVID-19 vaccines have in many cases been authorized for use via national emergency use authorization processes-mechanisms that enable the public to gain access to promising medical products before they have received full regulatory approval and licensure. In this paper, we examine whether unlicensed COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use should ever be considered essential medicines, thereby placing prioritized obligations on countries regarding their accessibility and affordability.","Smith, M.

A sample of 4527 adults living in Norway were recruited via social media. Data related to suicide thoughts and attempts, alcohol use, pandemic-related concerns, and sociodemographic variables were collected. Associations with suicide thoughts were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. In the sample, 3.6% reported suicide thoughts during the last month, while 0.2% had attempted suicide during the same period. Previous suicide attempts (OR: 11.93, p < 0.001), lower age (OR: 0.69, p < 0.001), daily alcohol use (OR: 3.31, p < 0.001), being in the risk group for COVID-19 complications (OR: 2.15, p < 0.001), and having economic concerns related to the pandemic (OR: 2.28, p < 0.001) were associated with having current suicide thoughts.

We describe conditions under which it is possible to define a mapping from the distribution that generated the existing external data to the relative efficiency of a covariate-adjusted estimator compared to an unadjusted estimator. Under conditions, these relative efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample size needed to achieve a desired power. We consider two situations where the outcome is either fully or partially observed and several treatment effect estimands that are of particular interest in most trials. For each such estimand, we develop a semiparametrically efficient estimator of the relative efficiency that allows for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the nuisance functions and an analytic form of a corresponding Wald-type confidence interval. We also propose a double bootstrap scheme for constructing confidence intervals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply these methods to data to estimate the relative efficiency of using covariate adjustment in Covid-19 therapeutic trials.","Li, Xiudi; Li, Sijia; Luedtke, Alex",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14752v1.pdf,196

250615,Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations and Risk for Subsequent Heart Failure Hospital Admissions: A 20-Year Territory-Wide Registry Study in Hong Kong,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder. Hematologic and cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 causes thromboembolic events across multiple organs which mainly manifest as venous thromboembolism, and rarely, peripheral arterial thromboembolic events. In-situ thrombosis of a healthy, non-atherosclerotic native artery is rare, and COVID-19 has been reported to be a cause of this phenomenon. We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients &#8805;18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. RESULTS: A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay. Six (0.9%) patients (one woman) with a median age of 62 years experienced ALI (IQR, 59-64.3). All patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin when they developed ALI. The median of duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and ALI symptom onset was 13 days (IQR, 11.3-14). Three patients underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy combined with systemic anticoagulation, and 3 received systemic anticoagulation alone. Two patients with ALI did not survive to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 1 patient underwent bilateral major amputations, and another underwent a minor amputation within 1 month of hospital discharge. Symptoms of ALI completely resolved in 2 patients without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder with involvement of hematologic and cardiovascular systems. Despite widespread use of thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of ALI, and subsequent limb loss or even death.","Topcu, Ahmet Can; Ozturk-Altunyurt, Gozde; Akman, Dilara; Batirel, Ayse; Demirhan, Recep",Ann. vasc. surg,,196

Recent studies suggest the possibility of a cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19, similar to the biochemical profile seen in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), raising the question of possible benefits that could be derived from targeted immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the literature regarding the diagnosis and features of HLH, particularly secondary HLH, and aimed to identify gaps in the literature to truly clarify the existence of a COVID-19 associated HLH. Diagnostic criteria such as HScore or HLH-2004 may have suboptimal performance in identifying COVID-19 HLH-like presentations, and criteria such as soluble CD163, NK cell activity, or other novel biomarkers may be more useful in identifying this entity.","Chu, Raymond; van Eeden, Charmaine; Suresh, Sneha; Sligl, Wendy I; Osman, Mohammed; Cohen Tervaert, Jan Willem",Int. j. mol. sci.

253789,Prognostic imaging biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease (iBEAt): study protocol,2020,"COVID-19 and its countermeasures have negatively impacted the mental health of populations worldwide. The current paper considers whether the rising incidence of psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic may affect lay beliefs about the cause and course of mental illness. Laypeople's causal attributions and expectations regarding the trajectory of mental illness have important implications for societal stigma and therapeutic orientations. Two online experimental studies investigated whether reading about fictional cases of mental illness that were explicitly situated during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with reading about the same cases without any pandemic-related contextualisation, affected attributions and expectations about Generalised Anxiety Disorder (Study 1) and Major Depressive Disorder (Study 2). Study 1 (n = 137) results showed that highlighting the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic weakened attributions to biological causes and reduced the anticipated duration of symptoms. However, Study 2 (n = 129) revealed no effects of COVID-19 contextualisation on beliefs about the cause or course of depression. The research provides preliminary evidence that the increased incidence of mental illness during the pandemic may reshape public beliefs about certain mental illnesses. Given the importance of public understandings for the lived experience of mentally unwell persons in society, further evidence of the range and extent of the pandemic's effects on lay beliefs is important to inform clinical, public health and stigma-reduction initiatives.","O039,; Connor, Cliodhna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,196

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association between DM and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed from several electronic databases on subjects that assess DM and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, including mortality, severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and disease progression. RESULTS: There were a total of 6452 patients from 30 studies. Meta-analysis showed that DM was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 2.38 [1.88, 3.03], p < 0.001; I2: 62%) and its subgroup which comprised of mortality (RR 2.12 [1.44, 3.11], p < 0.001; I2: 72%), severe COVID-19 (RR 2.45 [1.79, 3.35], p < 0.001; I2: 45%), ARDS (RR 4.64 [1.86, 11.58], p = 0.001; I2: 9%), and disease progression (RR 3.31 [1.08, 10.14], p = 0.04; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by age (p = 0.003) and hypertension (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in studies with median age &#8805;55 years-old (RR 1.92) compared to <55 years-old (RR 3.48), and in prevalence of hypertension &#8805;25% (RR 1.93) compared to <25% (RR 3.06). Subgroup analysis on median age <55 years-old and prevalence of hypertension <25% showed strong association (RR 3.33) CONCLUSION: DM was associated with mortality, severe COVID-19, ARDS, and disease progression in patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Ian; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,196

256211,Covid-19 and hepatic injury: A systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a policy option to reduce consumption of alcohol and the harm it does, on May 1, 2018, Scotland introduced a minimum price of 50 British pence (p) per unit of alcohol (8 g) sold; Wales followed suit on March 2, 2020, with the same minimum unit price (MUP). We analysed household purchase data based on bar codes to assess the impact of these policy options in the medium term for Scotland and in the immediate term for Wales. METHODS: For these location-controlled, interrupted time series regression analyses, the data source was Kantar WorldPanel's household shopping panel, which, at the time of our analysis, included 35 242 British households providing detailed information on 1·24 million separate alcohol purchases in 2015-18 and the first half of 2020. With no data exclusions, we analysed the impact of introducing MUP in Scotland, using purchases in northern England as control, and in Wales, using western England as control. The studied changes associated with MUP were price paid per gram of alcohol purchased, grams of alcohol purchased, and amount of money spent on alcohol. FINDINGS: In Scotland, price increases and purchase decreases following the introduction of MUP in 2018 were maintained during the first half of 2020. The difference between Scotland and northern England in 2020 was a price increase of 0·741 p per gram (95% CI 0·724-0·759), a 7·6% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·063 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·656-7·470), a 7·7% decrease. In Wales, the introduction of MUP led to similar results. The difference between Wales and western England was a price increase 0·841 of 0·841 p per gram (0·732-0·951), an 8·2% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·052 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·463-7·640), an 8·6% decrease. For both Scotland and Wales, reductions in overall purchases of alcohol were largely restricted to households that bought the most alcohol. The introduction of MUP was not associated with an increased expenditure on alcohol by households that generally bought small amounts of alcohol and, in particular, those with low incomes. The changes were not affected by the introduction of COVID-19 confinement in the UK on March 26, 2020. INTERPRETATION: The evidence base supporting the positive, targeted impact of MUP is strengthened by the comparable results for Scotland and Wales. The short-term impact of MUP in Scotland during 2018 is maintained during the first half of 2020. MUP is an effective alcohol policy option to reduce off-trade purchases of alcohol and should be widely considered.

256402,Evaluating the effect of automated hand hygiene technology on compliance and C. difficile rates in a long-term acute care hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) with or without cirrhosis, existing studies on the outcomes with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have limited generalizability. We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a harmonized electronic health record dataset of 6.4 million, to describe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis. METHODS: We identified all patients with CLD with or without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing in the N3C Data Enclave as of July 1, 2021. We used survival analyses to associate SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and clinical factors with the primary outcome of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 220,727 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 test status: 128,864 (58%) were noncirrhosis/negative, 29,446 (13%) were noncirrhosis/positive, 53,476 (24%) were cirrhosis/negative, and 8941 (4%) were cirrhosis/positive patients. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 3.9% in cirrhosis/negative and 8.9% in cirrhosis/positive patients. Compared to cirrhosis/negative patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 2.38 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. Compared to noncirrhosis/positive patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 3.31 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. In stratified analyses among patients with cirrhosis with increased age, obesity, and comorbid conditions (ie, diabetes, heart failure, and pulmonary disease), SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased adjusted hazard of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of approximately 221,000 nationally representative, diverse, and sex-balanced patients with CLD; we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.38 times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among patients with CLD infected with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with 3.31 times mortality hazard. These results provide an additional impetus for increasing vaccination uptake and further research regarding immune responses to vaccines in patients with severe liver disease.","Ge, Jin; Pletcher, Mark J; Lai, Jennifer C",Gastroenterology,,196

259648,Acute Kidney Injury and Covid-19: A Scoping Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital do Rim is a high-volume kidney transplant (KT) center located in São Paulo, a city with 12.2 million inhabitants. Over the last 18 years, we performed 11 436 KT, 70% of which from deceased donors. To mitigate the effects of reduction in the number of transplants on the waiting list, sequential measures were implemented when COVID-19 was declared pandemic. METHODS: The first step was to provide SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR testing for all symptomatic employees and patients and the compulsory use of personal protective equipment in the hospital facilities. Living donor KT were postponed, and all deceased donors and recipients were tested before the transplantation. The immunosuppressive protocols were maintained, and telehealth strategies were developed. RESULTS: Among the 1013 employees, there were 214 cases of COVID-19, nine required ward hospitalization, and no deaths occurred. In 26%, the probable source of contamination was occupational. From the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in 03/20/2020 till 10/21/2020, 523 deceased KT were performed, a 21% increase compared with 2019, with no confirmed donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four patients were transplanted with a positive pretransplant SARS-CoV-2 test, but none of them developed the disease. Overall, of 11 875 KT followed in our center, 674 developed COVID-19. Among the hospitalized, 53% required mechanical ventilation, and 45% required hemodialysis. Their overall mortality rate was 27.5%. CONCLUSION: This experience shows the challenges that transplant centers faced as the pandemic unfolded and illustrates the effectiveness of the sequential measures implemented to provide a safe environment for transplantation.","Cristelli, Marina P; Viana, Laila A; Fernandes, Ruan de A; Nakamura, Monica R; Foresto, Renato D; Stopa Martins, Suelen B; Alvarazi, Jacqueline F L; Leite, Valeria C; de Oliveira, Francisco R; Carneiro, Vanessa A; Santos, Daniel Wagner de C L; Aguiar, Wilson F; Vaz, Maria Lucia Dos S; Tedesco-Silva, Helio; Medina-Pestana, José",Transpl Infect Dis,,196

It was first confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa in Nigeria on 27 February 2020 and has since spread quickly to all sub-Saharan African countries, causing more than 111,309 confirmed cases and 2,498 deaths as of 03 June 2020. The lessons learned during the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in some sub-Saharan African countries were expected to shape and influence the region's responses to COVID-19 pandemic. However, some of the challenges associated with the management of the EVD outbreaks persist and create obstacles for the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the commonalities between the EVD epidemics and COVID-19 pandemic, with a view to draw on lessons learned to effectively tackle the ongoing pandemic. Key successes, failures and lessons learned from previous EVD outbreaks are discussed. Recommendations on how these lessons can be translated to strengthen the COVID-19 response in sub-Saharan Africa are provided.","Afolabi, Muhammed O; Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin; Munung, Nchangwi Syntia; Yakubu, Aminu; Ndow, Gibril; Jegede, Ayodele; Ambe, Jennyfer; Kombe, Francis",,,196
261341,Failure of early extubation among cases of coronavirus disease-19 respiratory failure: Case report and clinical experience,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptoms, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection depends on two human genes: the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as usage of 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population cohort, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed several interesting suggestive associations. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the TMPRSS2 genes were associated with thrombocytes count (p = 1.8 × 10−5). SNPs within the ACE2 gene were associated with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p = 5.7 × 10−4), an association that is significantly stronger in females (pdiff= 0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p = 5.5 × 10−4). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants could play a role in diseases such as thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

Pharmacists around the world have continued to provide direct patient care and perform frontline duties for their communities during this pandemic, but are often relegated to the background and overlooked when frontline workers are heralded. Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare practitioners, which is further proven during the pandemic as they continued to provide direct patient care despite restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic. Due to the inaccessibility of other healthcare practitioners during this time, community pharmacists have reduced the burden on the healthcare system by diverting the influx of patients away from hospitals through triaging and screening patients. Community pharmacists have played various roles in supporting the healthcare system during COVID-19: delivering medications to patients, educating patients on telehealth services, assessing patients for renewal of chronic medications, performing consultations on minor ailments, clarifying misconceptions about COVID-19 treatments, and contributing to COVID-19 screening. Alongside ICU nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists, hospital pharmacists have been part of the COVID-19 efforts and their roles include management of drug shortages, development of treatment protocols, participation of patient rounds, interpretation of lab results for COVID-19, participant recruitment for clinical trials, exploration of new drugs, medication management advice, and antimicrobial stewardship. Further support from pharmacists will be needed once a vaccine is launched in order to reach population-wide coverage. Amid COVID-19, pharmacists have not stopped working as frontline workers and they should be recognized as such.","Elbeddini, Ali; Prabaharan, Thulasika; Almasalkhi, Sarah; Tran, Cindy",J. pharm. policy pract.,,196

The Scientific Medical Policy Committee (SMPC) of the American College of Physicians developed these rapid, living practice points to summarize the current and best available evidence on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody durability after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, and antibody protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The SMPC developed these rapid, living practice points based on a rapid and living systematic evidence review done by the Portland VA Research Foundation and funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Ongoing literature surveillance is planned through December 2021. When new studies are identified and a full update of the evidence review is published, the SMPC will assess the new evidence and any effect on the practice points. Practice Points: Practice Point 1: Do not use SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Practice Point 2: Antibody tests can be useful for the purpose of estimating community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Practice Point 3: Current evidence is uncertain to predict presence, level, or durability of natural immunity conferred by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against reinfection (after SARS-CoV-2 infection).","Qaseem, Amir; Yost, Jennifer; Etxeandia-Ikobaltzeta, Itziar; Forciea, Mary Ann; Abraham, George M; Miller, Matthew C; Obley, Adam J; Humphrey, Linda L",Ann. intern. med,,196

Manipulation may be less likely in democracies, which have checks to ensure transparency. We show that data on disease burden bear indicia of data modification by authoritarian governments relative to democratic governments. First, data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from authoritarian governments show significantly less variation from a 7 day moving average. Because governments have no reason to add noise to data, lower deviation is evidence that data may be massaged. Second, data on COVID-19 deaths from authoritarian governments do not follow Benford's law, which describes the distribution of leading digits of numbers. Deviations from this law are used to test for accounting fraud. Smoothing and adjustments to COVID-19 data may indicate other alterations to these data and a need to account for such alterations when tracking the disease.","Kapoor, Mudit; Malani, Anup; Ravi, Shamika; Agrawal, Arnav",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09566v1.pdf,196

274901,Unusual Early Recovery of a Critical COVID-19 Patient After Administration of Intravenous Vitamin C,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: There are growing concerns regarding the potential risk of coronavirus disease transmission during surgery and in particular during minimally invasive procedures owing to the aerosolization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles. However, no study has demonstrated this hypothesis. Here, we aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke. DESIGN: A prospective pilot study. SETTING: A tertiary cancer center in northern Italy. PATIENTS: Overall, 17 patients underwent laparoscopic procedures for the management of suspected or documented gynecologic malignancies. The median age was 57 years (range 26-77). The surgical indications included endometrial cancer (nâ¯=â¯11), borderline ovarian tumor (nâ¯=â¯3), early-stage ovarian cancer (nâ¯=â¯1), stage IA cervical cancer after diagnostic conization (nâ¯=â¯1), and an ovarian cyst that turned out to be benign at final histologic examination (nâ¯=â¯1). INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated all consecutive women scheduled to have laparoscopic procedures for suspected or documented gynecologic cancers. The patients underwent planned laparoscopic surgery. At the end of the laparoscopic procedures (after extubation), we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from both the endotracheal tube and the filter applied on the trocar valve. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 1 patient, both swab tests (endotracheal tube and trocar valve filter) showed amplification of the N gene on RT-PCR analysis. This case was considered to be a presumptive positive case. In another case, the RT-PCR analysis showed an amplification curve for the N gene only in the swab test performed on the filter. No ORF1ab amplification was detected. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the proof of principle that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted through surgical smoke and aerosolized native fluid from the abdominal cavity.","Bogani, Giorgio; Ditto, Antonino; De Cecco, Loris; Lopez, Salvatore; Guerrisi, Rocco; Piccioni, Federico; Micali, Arianna; Daidone, Maria Grazia; Raspagliesi, Francesco",J. minim. invasive gynecol,,196

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of interrupting invasive procedures in patients with chronic cardiac diseases due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. METHODS: The study population is comprised of 2,158 patients that were pending on elective cardiac invasive procedures in 37 hospitals in Spain on the 14th of March 2020, when a state of alarm and subsequent lockdown was declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients were followed-up until April 31th. RESULTS: Out of the 2,158 patients, 36 (1.7%) died. Mortality was significantly higher in patients pending on structural procedures (4.5% vs. 0.8%, respectively; p < .001), in those >80 year-old (5.1% vs. 0.7%, p < .001), and in presence of diabetes (2.7% vs. 0.9%, p = .001), hypertension (2.0% vs. 0.6%, p = .014), hypercholesterolemia (2.0% vs. 0.9%, p = .026) [Correction added on December 23, 2020, after first online publication: as per Dr. Moreno's request changes in p-values were made after original publication in Abstract.], chronic renal failure (6.0% vs. 1.2%, p < .001), NYHA > II (3.8% vs. 1.2%, p = .001), and CCS > II (4.2% vs. 1.4%, p = .013), whereas was it was significantly lower in smokers (0.5% vs. 1.9%, p = .013). Multivariable analysis identified age > 80, diabetes, renal failure and CCS > II as independent predictors for mortality.

Education is also a sector that has undergone huge changes due to the spreading of those devices. Even at the era of feature phones, it started to become clear that portable devices with access to the internet can be used for learning. The process of learning with the use of mobile phones was then in an early stage, due to the limitations of feature phones. Whereas, with the introduction of smartphones, education is expected to be drastically altered in the future, in most parts of the world. New, radical, and controversial in some cases, approaches have been developed, over the past years, in an effort to implement a mobile learning process in real life conditions. Intelligent tutoring systems have had rapid growth, especially in the COVID-19 era, while a significant increase in online courses via social networks has also been noted.

280168,Higher comorbidities and early death in hospitalized African-American patients with Covid-19,2021,"Research has shown that there is a relationship between bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of bisphenol AF (BPAF), a main substitute for BPA, on heart development remains unclear. In this study, the cardiotoxicity of BPAF was evaluated in zebrafish in vivo and in human cardiac myocytes (HCMs) in vitro. Our results showed that BPAF at a concentration of 200 µg/L results in cardiotoxicity, including a reduced number of cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells in the heart, and reduced heart size in two transgenic zebrafish models (myl7:: dsred2-nuc and fli1a::nGFP). An increase in apoptosis was observed along with antioxidant enzyme inhibition and lipid peroxidation. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of several key genes involved in cardiac development were suppressed by BPAF treatment. In the HCM cell model, BPAF at 2 mg/L induced reactive oxygen species generation, antioxidant enzyme inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative DNA damage. These adverse outcomes can be attenuated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity. These data indicated that BPAF exposure increased oxidative stress and apoptosis and that it suppressed the expression of genes involved in cardiac development, which may play crucial roles in the mechanisms of BPAF-induced cardiotoxicity.","Gu, Jie; Wang, Hongye; Zhou, Linjun; Fan, Deling; Shi, Lili; Ji, Guixiang; Gu, Aihua",Sci Total Environ,,196

Thus, this study will identify the use of digital technologies to monitor, identify contacts and track transmission chains of COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: The systematic review of this protocol will follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes Protocols. We will include studies that present digital technologies used in the monitoring of infected people, contact identification and the transmission chain of COVID-19 developed worldwide. For the selection of articles, the following databases will be consulted: PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Livivo and CINAHL. In addition, we will conduct extensive research on selected sources of gray literature, including bibliographic databases, web-based search engines, practice-oriented magazines and government websites. Data extraction will take place in 2 stages (1- title and abstract screening and 2- full-text screening) and will be carried out independently by 2 reviewers, using the Mendeley software and the Rayyan QCRI application. The studies will be characterized as to the type and design of the study in relation to the ease in demonstrating the technologies used and the type of information produced. If it is necessary to synthesize quantitative data, the heterogeneity assessment will be performed using I2 statistics, and the meta-analysis will be processed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: The development of this research will allow the knowledge of how these technologies were applied according to each territory and their effectiveness in reducing cases of COVID-19.

286125,Position paper on the preparation of immune plasma to be used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies have highlighted that fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 are important psychological factors that affect all populations. There currently remains a lack of research on specific amplification factors regarding fear and anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite established associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, empirical data investigating the associations between these three variables, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are currently lacking. Urgent research is needed to better understand the role of repeated media consumption concerning COVID-19 in amplifying fear and anxiety related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the associations between fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, and cyberchondria. METHODS: Convenience sampling was used to recruit respondents to participate in an online survey. The survey, which was distributed via social media and academic forums, comprised the Cyberchondria Severity Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: A total of 694 respondents (males: n=343, females: n=351) completed the online survey. The results showed that fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 predicted cyberchondria (fear: ß=.39, SE 0.04, P<.001, t=11.16, 95% CI 0.31-0.45; anxiety: ß=.25, SE 0.03, P<.001, t=7.67, 95% CI 0.19-0.32). In addition, intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 with cyberchondria. In a reciprocal model, the standardized total effects of cyberchondria on fear of COVID-19 (ß=.45, SE 0.04, P<.001, t=15.31, 95% CI 0.39-0.51) and COVID-19 anxiety (ß=.36, SE 0.03, P<.001, t=11.29, 95% CI 0.30-0.41) were statistically significant, with moderate effect sizes. Compared to males, females obtained significantly higher scores for cyberchondria (t1,692=-2.85, P=.004, Cohen d=0.22), COVID-19 anxiety (t1,692=-3.32, P<.001, Cohen d=0.26), and anxiety sensitivity (t1,692=-3.69, P<.001, Cohen d=0.29). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a better understanding of the role of COVID-19 in amplifying cyberchondria. Based on these results, cyberchondria must be viewed as a significant public health issue. Importantly, increasing awareness about cyberchondria and online behavior at both the individual and collective levels must be prioritized to enhance preparedness and to reduce the adverse effects of current and future medical crises.","Wu, Xue; Nazari, Nabi; Griffiths, Mark D",J Med Internet Res,,196

287021,Pathophysiology of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"C-Mannosyl tryptophan (C-Man-Trp) is a unique glycosylated amino acid present in various eukaryotes. The C-Man-Trp structure can be found as a monomeric form or a part of post-translational modifications within polypeptide chains in living organisms. However, the mechanism of how monomeric C-Man-Trp is produced has not been fully investigated. In this study, we assessed levels of cellular C-Man-Trp by ultra performance liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry assay system, and investigated whether the cellular C-Man-Trp is affected by autophagy induction. The intracellular C-Man-Trp level was significantly increased under serum and/or amino acid starvation in A549, HaCaT, HepG2, NIH3T3, and NRK49F cells. The increase in C-Man-Trp was also observed in NIH3T3 cells treated with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. The up-regulation of C-Man-Trp caused by starvation was reversed by the inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. We further showed that C-Man-Trp is produced by incubating a synthetic C-mannosylated peptide (C-Man-Trp-Ser-Pro-Trp) or thrombospondin (TSP) in a lysosomal fraction that was prepared from a mouse liver, which provides supporting evidence that C-Man-Trp is a degradation product of the C-mannosylated peptide or protein following lysosome-related proteolysis. Taken together, we propose that the autophagic pathway is a novel pathway that at least partly contributes to intracellular C-Man-Trp production under certain conditions, such as nutrient starvation.","Minakata, Shiho; Inai, Yoko; Manabe, Shino; Nishitsuji, Kazuchika; Ito, Yukishige; Ihara, Yoshito",Glycoconj. j,,196

Methods: We examined visit trends from 157 outpatient urologic practices and 3,165 providers included in the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry, a national Qualified Clinical Data Registry designed to measure, report and improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes. As of December 2020, 50 million patient visits from 7.3 million unique patients exist in the database. We used a data quality framework to assess issues related to data completeness and timeliness. Past data lag trends were assessed to determine a temporal cutoff point that minimized lag. To account for missing data, a comprehensive visit definition that went beyond E/M (Evaluation and Management) coding was applied and compared to results using the E/M-only definition. Results: Correlating with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in mid-March 2020, outpatient visits declined for five weeks, resulting in a 47.7% drop from the February 2020 baseline, followed by an 83.1% recovery back to baseline by July 31. Based on timeliness scores, which consider the average time between visit date and the visit data processing date from the selected practices, a 90-day buffer between data cutoff and the end of the analysis’s observation period was necessary to minimize data lag. Total patient encounters increased by more than 20% when using a more comprehensive visit definition Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a reduction in outpatient visits, followed by a recovery close to baseline. Our data quality framework identified and informed key study design decisions to account for inadequate data timeliness and completeness. These methods prevented an overestimation of the true decline in patient encounters and missed patient encounters.","Brendel, P.; Jain, R.; Lien, A.; Lee, D.; Shelton, J.

The aim of our study was to compare COVID-19 disparities in testing and positivity to cumulative environmental health impacts, and to assess how unique social and environmental determinants of health relate to COVID-19 positivity in Seattle, King County, WA, at the census tract level. Publicly available data (n = 397 census tracts) were obtained from Public Health-Seattle & King County, 2018 ACS 5-year estimates, and the Washington Tracking Network. COVID-19 testing and positive case rates as of July 12, 2020, were mapped and compared to Washington State Environmental Health Disparities (EHD) Map cumulative impact rankings. We calculated odds ratios from a series of univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses using cumulative impact rankings, and community-level socioeconomic, health, and environmental factors as predictors and having &#8805; 10% or < 10% census tract positivity as the binary outcome variable. We found a remarkable overlap between Washington EHD cumulative impact rankings and COVID-19 positivity in King County. Census tracts with &#8805; 10 % COVID-19 positivity had significantly lower COVID-19 testing rates and higher proportions of people of color and faced a combination of low socioeconomic status-related outcomes, poor community health outcomes, and significantly higher concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). King County communities experiencing high rates of COVID-19 face a disproportionate cumulative burden of environmental and social inequities. Cumulative environmental health impacts should therefore systematically be considered when assessing for risk of exposure to and health complications resulting from COVID-19.","Ingram, Carolyn; Min, Esther; Seto, Edmund; Cummings, B J; Farquhar, Stephanie",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,196

This paper article highlights both sides of the story. These times of the Covid-19 pandemic, with large swathes of public life emptied by social lock-down, remind us of a second, cross-cutting conceptual dimension, ranging from public space brimming with human life to its post-apocalyptic opposite eerily empty and silent.

Based on this premise, we sought to design a ventilator with the following criteria: 1) standard components that are accessible to the public, 2) ""open-source"" compatibility to allow anyone to easily recreate the system, 3) ability to ventilate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 4) lowest possible cost to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Design: We pursued development of a pneumatic-type ventilator. The basic design involves three electrically controlled solenoid valves, a pressure chamber, the patient breathing circuit, a positive end-expiratory pressure valve, and an electronics control system. Multiple safety elements were built into the design. The user-friendly interface allows simple control of ventilator settings. The ventilator delivers a hybrid form of pneumatic, assist-control ventilation, with predicted tidal volumes of 300-800 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure 0-20 cm H2O, and Fio2 21-100%. Main Results: The ventilator was extensively tested with two separate high-fidelity lung simulators and a porcine in vivo model. Both lung simulators were able to simulate a variety of pathologic states, including obstructive lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ventilator performed well across all simulated scenarios. Similarly, a porcine in vivo model was used to assess performance in live tissue, with a specific emphasis on gas exchange. The ventilator performed well in vivo and demonstrated noninferior ventilation and oxygenation when compared with the standard ventilator. Conclusions: The Portsmouth Ventilator was able to perform well across all simulated pathologies and in vivo. All components may be acquired by the public for a cost of approximately $250 U.S.D. Although this ventilator has limited functionality compared with modern ventilators, the simple design appears to be safe and would allow for rapid mass production if ventilator surge demand exceeded supply.","Cole, Jacob H; Hughey, Scott B; Rector, Christopher H; Booth, Gregory J",Crit Care Explor,,196

Among the populations affected by COVID-19 are people engaged in substance use, such as people who smoke; vape (e-cigarette use); use opioids, cannabis, alcohol, or psychoactive prescription drugs; or have a substance use disorder (SUD). Monitoring substance use and SUD during the pandemic is essential, as people who engage in substance use or present with SUD are at greater risk for COVID-19, and the economic and social changes resulting from the pandemic may aggravate SUD. There have been several reviews focused on COVID-19 in relation to substance use and SUD. Reviews generally did not consider on a large range of substance use variants or SUDs. We plan a scoping review that seeks to fill gaps in our current understanding of substance use and SUD, in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: A scoping review focused on substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19, will be conducted. We will search (from January 2020 onwards) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Global Health, WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease Database, WHO Global Index Medicus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Middle Eastern Central Asian Studies, CINAHL Complete, and Sociological Abstracts. Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, HSRProj, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., ClinicalTrial.gov , World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and International Standard Randomized Con-trolled Trial Number registry). Study selection will conform to Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies investigating substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19 in all populations and settings, will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods.

The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a novel battleground, as the first in which women have taken center stage, not only in their roles as physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and the like, but also by serving in leadership positions and facilitating innovations in science, technology, and policy. Yet, the pandemic has exacerbated multiple pain points that have disproportionally impacted women in health care, including shortages in correctly sized personal protective equipment and uniforms, inadequate support for pregnant and breastfeeding providers, and challenges associated with work-life balance and obtaining childcare. While the pandemic has facilitated several positive advancements in addressing these challenges, there is still much work to be done for women to achieve equity and optimal support in their roles on the frontlines.","Rabinowitz, Loren Galler; Rabinowitz, Danielle Galler",Acad Med,,196

Yet, most previous work on thermal niches has ignored detailed mechanistic information about the relationship between temperature and organismal performance, which can be described by a thermal performance curve. Here, we develop a model that predicts the width of thermal performance curves will be narrower in the presence of interspecific competitors, causing a species' optimal breeding temperature to diverge from that of its competitor. We test this prediction in the Asian burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis, confirming that the divergence in actual and optimal breeding temperatures is the result of competition with their primary competitor, blowflies. However, we further show that intraspecific cooperation enables beetles to outcompete blowflies by recovering their optimal breeding temperature. Ultimately, linking abiotic factors and biotic interactions on niche width will be critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change.","Tsai, Hsiang-Yu; Rubenstein, Dustin R; Chen, Bo-Fei; Liu, Mark; Chan, Shih-Fan; Chen, De-Pei; Sun, Syuan-Jyun; Yuan, Tzu-Neng; Shen, Sheng-Feng",eLife (Cambridge),,196

302278,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis complicating COVID-19 in the ICU - A case report,2020,"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a wide variety of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory syndrome that can progress to life-threatening lung lesions. The identification of prognostic factors can help to improve the risk stratification of patients by promptly defining for each the most effective therapy to resolve the disease. The etiological agent causing COVID-19 is a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that enters cells via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a reduction in ACE2 levels, leading to an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and consequently, in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. ERAP1 and ERAP2 are two RAS regulators and key components of MHC class I antigen processing. Their polymorphisms have been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, hypertension, and cancer. Based on their involvement in the RAS, we believe that the dysfunctional status of ERAP1 and ERAP2 enzymes may exacerbate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, aggravating the symptomatology and clinical outcome of the disease.

302543,Don't Overlook Digestive Symptoms in Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been keeping the world in suspense. Proven risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 are common diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or respiratory disorders. Until today, little is known about the psychological burden of individuals suffering from these high-risk diseases regard to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to define the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on behavior and mental health in individuals at high risk for developing a severe COVID-19 course. Items assessed generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior, and the subjective risk perception of regarding symptoms, having a severe course and dying because of COVID-19. Data were compared between participants with the high risk diseases and individuals without any of those diseases. 16,983 respondents completed the study. Generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior and subjective risk perception were elevated in participants with high-risk diseases. The increased COVID-19-related fear as a functional concern is a conclusion on the increased risk of a severe course. The functionality of the fear is reflected in people's increased need for security and includes an increase in both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior that underlines the need for psychological support strategies.","Kohler, Hannah; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Weismüller, Benjamin; Fink, Madeleine; Musche, Venja; Robitzsch, Anita; Pfeiffer, Corinna; Benecke, Anke-Verena; Dörrie, Nora; Führer, Dagmar; Taube, Christian; Rassaf, Tienush; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",J Prim Care Community Health,,196

Studying social media can be informative to assess how we are collectively coping with this unprecedented global crisis. However, social media platforms are also populated by bots, automated accounts that can amplify certain topics of discussion at the expense of others, possibly distorting the perception of the ongoing conversation. In this paper, we study 43.3M English tweets about COVID-19 and provide early evidence of the use of bots to promote political conspiracies in the US, but also as a tool to enable participatory activism to surface information that could otherwise be censored in China.","Ferrara, Emilio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09531v1.pdf,196
306251,Association of HLA Class I Genotypes With Severity of Coronavirus Disease-19,2021,"AimsAddictions services had to respond rapidly to reduce COVID-19 transmission to protect patients and staff. Patients with opioid dependence are particularly vulnerable, with high risks. Our community addiction service changed practice in line with COVID-19 guidelines. For patients with opioid dependence;face-to-face contacts were initially reduce and mainly for new starts, restarts and non-attenders. Prescribing changes were completed on an individually risk assessed basis to reduce attendance at the chemist, specifically to reduce transmission, keep patients in treatment and to ensure chemists could continue to function. We document some of the service changes during the COVID-19 lockdown.MethodService evaluation had approval from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust. Data retrieved on one Hub of a community addictions service in North England, UK. Patients prescribed opioid substitution treatment for opioid dependence were assessed, with data retrieval through electronic healthcare records. Data were analysed by Microsoft Excel anonymously.ResultIn lockdown (March 2020 to June 2020), we identified 112 patients with opioid dependence prescribed opioid substitution (OST) with methadone or buprenorphine at the Hub. All white British, mean 42 years, most male (75%) and prescribed methadone (78%). Ten were new starts and 8 restarts to OST. Attendance rates did not change: 91% before and 92% during lockdown. Appointment format changed from predominantly face-to-face (92%) to telephone (99%). Most patients (91%;n = 88) were offered take-home naloxone and overdose prevention training of which 14 refused. Supervision days at the chemist for OST reduced significantly from 75% collecting daily at the chemist, reducing to 20% during lockdown. Five patients were shielding and 7 had covid-related symptoms. There was one death during lockdown which was not attributed to covid or overdose.ConclusionThe addictions service continued to be open and work proactively throughout lockdown, seeing new patients and continuing treatment interventions safely. Major changes were made in line with COVID-19 guidelines, to respond to the threat of transmission. Our service was flexible and able to adapt quickly to remote working. We maintained excellent attendance rates despite changes to the format of consultations. There were no related incidents e.g. overdoses linked to prescribed medications, despite a reduction in supervision, and therefore patients having extra medications. This important finding may be related to the individual risk assessments that we conducted before making changing to prescribing. This was supported by most patients were receiving naloxone to prevent overdoses. Some of the changes, such as telephone consultations, may be beneficial to continue post COVID-19.","Shahbaz, Shumaila Hashmani Zeeshan Mayet Soraya",BJPsych Open,,196
306252,Association of HLA Class I Genotypes With Severity of Coronavirus Disease-19,2021,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has posed unprecedented threat to global public health. The virus-encoded non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional enzyme consisting of an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Here, we report the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN domain bound to its co-factor nsp10 and show that, compared to the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-full-length complex, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN retains an integral exoribonuclease fold and preserves an active configuration in the catalytic center. Analysis of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN interface reveals a footprint in nsp10 extensively overlapping with that observed in the nsp10/nsp16 structure. A marked difference in the co-factor when engaging nsp14 and nsp16 lies in helix-&#945;1', which is further experimentally ascertained to be involved in nsp14-binding but not in nsp16-engagement. Finally, we also show that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is enzymatically active despite the absence of nsp14-MTase domain. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN functions as an exoribonuclease with both structural and functional integrity.","Lin, Sheng; Chen, Hua; Chen, Zimin; Yang, Fanli; Ye, Fei; Zheng, Yue; Yang, Jing; Lin, Xi; Sun, Honglu; Wang, Lingling; Wen, Ao; Dong, Haohao; Xiao, Qingjie; Deng, Dong; Cao, Yu; Lu, Guangwen",Nucleic Acids Res,,196
306571,Patients' perceptions on the use of renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the new strain of the coronavirus. There is limited data on pathogenesis and the cellular responses of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to determine the variation of metabolites between healthy control and COVID-19 via the untargeted metabolomics method. Serum samples were obtained from 44 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed by LC/Q-TOF/MS method. Data acquisition, classification, and identification were achieved by the METLIN database and XCMS. Significant differences were determined between patients and healthy controls in terms of purine, glutamine, leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and glutathione metabolisms. Down regulations were determined in R-S lactoglutathione and glutamine. Up-regulations were detected in hypoxanthine, inosine, and LTD4. Identified metabolites indicate roles for purine, glutamine, LTD4, and glutathione metabolisms in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19. The use of selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists, targeting purinergic signaling as a therapeutic approach and glutamine supplementation may decrease the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

306929,Presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19: case series study,2020,"Brazil and many countries are now experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study is to compare results with statistical samples involving millions of people in the two largest neighboring states in Brazil, Amazonas and Pará, which in the first wave were similar but now show significant different results in combating COVID-19. During the first wave, in May 2020, the maximums of the 7-day average daily deaths per population of Amazonas and Pará were similar: 15.7 and 17.1 deaths per day per million people, respectively, which means a ratio 15.7/17.1 = 0.92 &#8776; 1. Now, in the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak, Amazonas has entered a serious situation; meanwhile, Pará has presented a much smaller growth in the mortality. The accumulated mortality per population from 11 November 2020 to 15 March 2021 of Amazonas and Pará are 1645 and 296 deaths per million people, respectively. As 1645/296 = 5.55, Amazonas is presenting an accumulated mortality per population more than five times that of Pará. Future in-depth research can provide a grounded answer to explain this significant difference, nonetheless the explicit support of the Pará state government, after 21 May 2020, to early ambulatory treatment may have played some role on this result.","Emmerich, Francisco G",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,196

First, it demonstrates a low cost implementation of a BLE/MQTT gateway to support monitoring and control of the patient health conditions from distance by means of the commonly used health devices. A variant of the CPS model is used to execute the monitoring and control tasks effectively. Secondly, it points out that such a gateway together with conventional BLE sensors on body temperature and oxygen in the blood and possible other BLE edge devices allow us to implement a pervasive warning system on COVID status and some general forecast on COVID diffusion. MQTT edge devices are also outlined for measuring the relevant health parameters at distance without the help of the above gateway, but in a way that the sensed data may interoperate with the ones taken by the conventional BLE devices. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

308728,Dwindling blood reserves: An ominous downside of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Primary care is the ideal place to implement behaviour change interventions for weight management. However, most primary care physicians are not managing patient weight as a standard of care due to lack of knowledge, skills and reimbursement. Generating more physicians who are familiar and comfortable with providing weight management is essential in leveraging a global change. In our university free clinic, medical students provide healthy lifestyle counselling using shared decision making to each patient at every clinic visit. OBJECTIVE: Improve the efficacy of behaviour change interventions via increased patient responsiveness and adherence. METHODS: The needs assessment demonstrated a subpar patient response rate to check-ins regarding behavioural change goals. In the first and second interventions, check-in message structure and contact schedule were varied to maximize patient responsiveness and goal achievement. RESULTS: In the needs assessment, 58% of patients responded to follow-ups and 58% of patients accomplished their goal. The first intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 70% and accomplishment of goals to 59%. The second intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 78% and accomplishment of goals to 74%. CONCLUSIONS: Messages that were frequent, unique, succinct and delivered within 4 weeks after the clinic visit resulted in the highest response rate and goal attainment. Other primary care clinics can use these interventions to increase patient completion of implemented behaviour changes for a healthier lifestyle.","Lessans, Spencer; Vega, Xamil; Foley, Brandon; Bossan, Alexia; Baker, Alexandra; McElroy, Mitchell; Crouse, Eloisa; Pasarica, Magdalena",,,196

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO. A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge.

METHODS: This is the prospective study of 2403 patients hospitalised at 13 hospitals within the COVID-19 epicentres of the Iran. These patients were treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, favipiravir and remdesivir alone or in combination with azithromycin. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of critical QTc prolongation, and secondary outcomes were incidences of TdP and death. RESULTS: Of the 2403 patients, 2365 met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome of QTc &#8805; 500 ms and &#8710;QTc &#8805; 60 ms was observed in 11.2% and 17.6% of the patients, respectively. The secondary outcomes of TdP and death were reported in 0.38% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively. The risk of critical QT prolongation increased in the presence of female gender, history of heart failure, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin combination therapy, simultaneous furosemide or beta-blocker therapy and acute renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, the risk of TdP was predicted by treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, simultaneous amiodarone or furosemide administration and hypokalaemia during treatment. CONCLUSION: This cohort showed significant QTc prolongation with all COVID-19 medications studied, however, life-threatening arrhythmia of TdP occurred rarely. Among the repurposed drugs studied, hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir alone or in combination with azithromycin clearly demonstrated to increase the risk of critical QT prolongation and/or TdP.","Haghjoo, Majid; Golipra, Reza; Kheirkhah, Jalal; Golabchi, Allahyar; Shahabi, Javad; Oni-Heris, Saeed; Sami, Ramin; Tajmirriahi, Marzieh; Saravi, Mehrdad; Khatami, Mozhdeh; Varnasseri, Mehran; Kiarsi, Mohammadreza; Hejazi, Seyed Fakhreddin; Yousefzadeh Rahaghi, Mojtaba; Taherkhani, Maryam; Ashraf, Haleh; Keshmiri, Mohammad Sadegh; Akbarzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Bozorgi, Ali; Mottaghizadeh, Fateme; Hedayat, Behnam; Heidarali, Mona; Hajhossein Talasaz, Azita",Int J Clin Pract,,196

After having assessed the need for a review and the topic itself (a), the literature search was performed (b), studies were screened and selected (c), data was extracted (d), and the findings were summarised (e). RESULTS: Thirty-six studies emerged with mainly an explorative/descriptive or case study design. The courses have been developed mainly by universities alone or in collaboration with institutions mainly in US, Sweden and the UK. Their delivery has been performed at multi-national levels, mainly in English, and with a number of participants ranging from 45 to >23,000. The duration spanned from two weeks to six months on clinical topics (e.g., emergency medicine) to methods (e.g., statistics). The target audience has been mainly mixed, including students, healthcare professionals, and lay citizens. Evaluation methods and tools have been described in 28 studies, and multiple-choice questions were most frequently adopted. Factors affecting the effectiveness of massive open online courses have been identified analysing the courses themselves and the participants. CONCLUSION: Massive open online courses have recently started to be studied in healthcare sciences: these can be useful to educate students, mainly as elective courses, and to educate a massive audience, thus embodying the third mission of the university. The complexity of factors increasing effectiveness suggests the need for a multidisciplinary approach both in their design and implementation.","Longhini, Jessica; De Colle, Beatrice; Rossettini, Giaocmo; Palese, Alvisa",Nurse Educ Today,,196
314368,Severe COVID-19 complicated with pulmonary embolism: a case report and literature review,2020,"In the post-COVID-19 era, virology-related research, which not only depends on the governments as its main source of funding but also requires international and interdisciplinary collaborations, is recognized as an essential defense for sustainability Few published studies have examined the trend, but only for certain viruses before the mid-2010s Moreover, it is challenging to define generally accepted virology-related research fields due to its broad spectrum Thus, it is time that we confront the unprecedented pandemic to understand the status of nationally supported projects in developed nations to establish international collaborative research strategies from an interdisciplinary perspective In this study, 32,365 national-funded projects were collected from the US, EU, and Japan and assigned to five scientific fields to conduct a cluster analysis Then, an expert-based approach was utilized to define an individual cluster Moreover, a comparative analysis between nations was carried out to determine if there was a competitive edge for collaboration As a result, a framework for virology-related research areas was constructed to provide the status quo and differences between nations’ research capabilities, thereby eliciting practical global research and development (R&amp;D) cooperation to achieve a common agenda and a direction for goals in the post-COVID-19 era These findings have implications for viral response R&amp;D, policy, and practice for future pandemics A systematic approach based on scientific evidence and an R&amp;D collaboration strategy between industry and academia is essential to resolve the interdisciplinary barriers between countries and promote sustainable virus R&amp;D collaboration","Lee, Doyeon; Kang, Jongseok; Kim, Keunhwan",Sustainability,,196

315763,COVID-19 in an Adult With Tricuspid Atresia S/P Fontan Palliation,2020,"Introduction: Reports from the United States suggest that acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently complicates COVID-19, but understanding of AKI risks and outcomes is incomplete. Additionally, whether kidney outcomes have evolved during the course of the pandemic is unknown. Methods: We used electronic records to identify COVID-19 patients with and without AKI admitted to 3 New York Hospitals between March 2 and August 25, 2020. Outcomes included AKI overall and according to admission week, AKI stage, the requirement for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality and recovery of kidney function. Logistic regression was utilized to assess associations of patient characteristics and outcomes. Results: Out of 4732 admissions 1386 (29.3%) patients had AKI. Among those with AKI, 717 (51.7%) had Stage 1, 132 (9.5%) Stage 2, 537 (38.7%) stage 3, and 237 (17.1%) required RRT initiation. In March 536/1648 (32.5%) of patients developed AKI compared with 15/87 (17.2%) in August (P<0.001 for monthly trend) whereas RRT initiation was required in 6.9% and 0% of admission, in March and August respectively. Mortality was higher with than without AKI (51.6% vs 8.6%) and was 71.9% in individuals requiring RRT. However, most patients with AKI who survived hospitalization (77%) recovered to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline creatinine. Among those surviving to discharge, 62% discontinued RRT. Conclusions: AKI impacts a high proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients and is associated with high mortality, particularly when RRT is required. AKI incidence appears to be decreasing over time and kidney function frequently recovers in those who survive.","Charytan, David M; Parnia, Sam; Khatri, Minesh; Petrilli, Christopher M; Jones, Simon; Benstein, Judith; Horwitz, Leora I",,,196

319101,Case Report: Chilblains-like lesions (COVID-19 toes) during the pandemic - is there a diagnostic window?,2020,"Identifying cybersickness in virtual reality (VR) applications such as games in a fast, precise, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive way remains challenging. Several factors can cause cybersickness, and their identification will help find its origins and prevent or minimize it. One such factor is virtual movement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in different forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally annotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often preferable to save it in a compressed form. Compression allows redundant data to be eliminated while still preserving changes in speed and direction. Since changes in direction and velocity in VR can be associated with cybersickness, changes in compression rate can likely indicate changes in cybersickness levels. In this research, we explore whether quantifying changes in virtual movement can be used to estimate variation in cybersickness levels of VR users. We investigate the correlation between changes in the compression rate of movement data in two VR games with changes in players' cybersickness levels captured during gameplay. Our results show (1) a clear correlation between changes in compression rate and cybersickness, and(2) that a machine learning approach can be used to identify these changes. Finally, results from a second experiment show that our approach is feasible for cybersickness inference in games and other VR applications that involve movement.","Monteiro, Diego; Liang, Hai-Ning; Tang, Xiaohang; Irani, Pourang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09538v1.pdf,196

The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time. AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis. In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.","Bu, Jun; Chen, Mao; Cheng, Xiaoshu; Dong, Yifei; Fang, Weiyi; Ge, Junbo; Gong, Yanjun; He, Ben; Huang, Lan; Huo, Yong; Jia, Shaobin; Jiang, Jun; Li, Yue; Li, Zhao; Liang, Chun; Liu, Xuebo; Liu, Zhenyu; Ma, Xiang; Ma, Yitong; Qian, Juying; Shen, Chengxing; Shen, Difei; Shen, Li; Shi, Ruizheng; Su, Xi; Sun, Yingxian; Tang, Yida; Wang, Jianan; Wu, Yue; Xiang, Dingcheng; Xu, Tongda; Xu, Yawei; Yang, Yuejin; Zeng, Hesong; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Guogang; Zhang, Ruiyan; Zhang, Shuning; Zhang, Yun; Zhang, Zheng; Zheng, Bo; Zhou, Ning",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,196

In the present paper we discuss four pillars to face a pandemic: surgical and outpatients service, tele-medicine and tele-education. In the face of unprecedented risks in providing adequate health care to our patients during this current, evolving public health crisis of COVID-19, alternative patient management tools such as telemedicine services, allow clinicians to maintain necessary patient rapport with their healthcare provider when required. As a subspecialty, urology should take full advantage of telehealth and tele-education at this juncture. As tele-urology and tele-education can obviate the potential drawbacks of ""social distancing"" as it pertains to healthcare, the platform can also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, without compromising quality urological care and educational efforts. Telehealth can bring urologists and their patients together, perhaps closer than ever.","Cacciamani, Giovanni Enrico; Shah, Mihir; Yip, Wesley; Abreu, Andre; Park, Daniel; Fuchs, Gerhard",Int Braz J Urol,,196

It was a great debate about ARBs whether to be stopped or continued for patients using them especially at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we carried out a virtual screening for almost all members of ARBs (nine) against COVID-19 main protease. Molecular docking as one of the important computational techniques was performed in this work. Interestingly, the tested compounds showed variable binding affinities in the order of N3 inhibitor (10, docked) > Fimasartan (8) > Candesartan (2) > Olmesartan (7) > Azilsartan (9) > Eprosartan (5) > Valsartan (3) > Losartan (1) > Irbesartan (6) > Telmisartan (4). Moreover, Fimasartan (8), Candesartan (2), and Olmesartan (7) were additionally estimated through molecular dynamic simulations monitored via computing the binding free energy using MM-GBSA. The results are promising for rapidly repurposing such drugs (especially, Fimasartan (8) and Candesartan (2)) after further preclinical and clinical studies either alone or in combination with others for the treatment of COVID-19 virus especially known to cause vasodilatation (to prevent blood coagulation) and to reduce inflammation and fibrosis (to prevent pulmonary fibrosis), with well-known safety profiles. In vitro, the virtual findings were consistent with the experimental testing of four representative ARBs. Out of the tested compounds, Olmesartan (7) showed the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (IC50 = 1.808 µM, and CC50 = 557.6 µM) with high selectivity index (308.4) against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. This work may clarify and approve not only the safety of ARBs used by a large group of patients worldwide but also their possible effectiveness against the COVID-19 virus either as a prophylactic or treatment option. It intended also to give a clear spot on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) required for the future design of new drugs targeting the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 protease by medicinal chemists.","Alnajjar, Radwan; Mostafa, Ahmed; Kandeil, Ahmed; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A",Heliyon,,196

Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease.","Abdul Bari, Ahamed Basha; Samuel, Prince Johnson",J Immunoassay Immunochem,,196

We report the case of a full-term neonate born to a mother who developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 32 weeks of gestation. The placental pathology showed slight local inflammation. Serial quantitative antibody measurements in the neonate showed elevated levels of IgM on the day of birth and a gradual decline to negative levels within 28 days of life; the levels of IgG declined gradually, but IgG was still positive on day 50 of life. The sequential dynamic changes in antibody levels in the neonate were consistent with those in his mother. One-step reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat and anal swabs showed positive results (750 and 892copies/ml) on day 7 of life and negative results on day 14 of life. The neonate had no symptoms of COVID-19. This report enables us to re-evaluate the significance of IgM detection in intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents a favorable prognosis for the neonate with long-term exposure to maternal COVID-19, despite a high possibility of intrauterine infection.","Gao, Jinzhi; Hu, Xiaolin; Sun, Xuan; Luo, Xiaoping; Chen, Ling",Int J Infect Dis,,196
349324,Abnormal rich club organization in end-stage renal disease patients before dialysis initiation and undergoing maintenance hemodialysis,2020,"Older adults are far more vulnerable to adverse health outcomes and mortality after contracting COVID-19. There are likely multiple age-related biological, clinical and environmental reasons for this increased risk, all of which are exacerbated by underlying age-associated changes to the immune system as well as increased prevalence of chronic disease states in older adults. Innate immune system overactivity, termed the cytokine storm, appears to be critical in the development of the worst consequences of COVID-19 infection. Pathophysiology suggests that viral stimulation of the innate immune system, augmented by inflammatory signals sent from dying cells, ramps up into a poorly controlled outpouring of inflammatory mediators. Other aging related changes in cells such as senescence as well as higher prevalence of chronic disease states also likely ramp up inflammatory signaling. This in turn drives downstream pathophysiological changes to pulmonary, cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and brain tissues that drive many of the adverse health outcomes observed in older adults. This article provides an overview of the underlying etiologies of innate immune system activation and adaptive immune system dysregulation in older adults and how they potentiate the consequences of the COVID-19 related cytokine storm, and possible uses of this knowledge to develop better risk assessment and treatment monitoring strategies.","Nidadavolu, Lolita; Walston, Jeremy","J. gerontol.

The SARS-CoV-2 are newly emerged ß coronaviruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive viral RNA genome expressing open reading frames that code for structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. The S1 subunit of S protein facilitates ACE2 mediated virus attachment while S2 subunit promotes membrane fusion. The presence of glutamine, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine and serine amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 enhances ACE2 binding. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between N Terminal Domain (NTD) and C Terminal Domain (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. The linker region contains phosphorylation sites that regulate its functioning. The CTD promotes nucleocapsid formation. The E protein contains a NTD, hydrophobic domain and CTD which form viroporins needed for viral assembly. The M protein possesses hydrophilic C terminal and amphipathic N terminal. Its long-form promotes spike incorporations and the interaction with E facilitates virion production. As each protein is essential in viral functioning, this review describes the insights of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins that would help in developing therapeutic strategies by targeting each protein to curb the rapidly growing pandemic.","Satarker, Sairaj; Nampoothiri, Madhavan",Arch Med Res,,196

Objective: To explore the experience of being a registered nurse caring for patients with COVID-19 at an urban academic medical center during the early stages of the pandemic. Design: Qualitative descriptive study, guided by Donabedian's Quality Framework for Evaluation of Healthcare Delivery which focuses on structures, processes, and outcomes of care delivery. Setting: Urban academic medical center in the northeast United States. Participants: Registered nurses cared for or caring for patients with COVID-19, age &#8805;18 years old, and English-speaking. Methods: Participants were recruited for individual in-person semi-structured interviews. Interviews occurred during March and April 2020 and were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed by two researchers using emergent qualitative content analysis to identify themes. Results: Twenty-one registered nurses participated in the study. Three themes emerged from the data, included one relevant to structures and two relevant to processes of care during the pandemic. Registered nurses perceived the clinical context as highly dynamic, but quickly adapted to pandemic-related care delivery. They felt a ""sense of duty"" to care for patients with COVID-19, despite being fearful of acquiring or spreading infection. Compared to clinical colleagues, registered nurses reported increased patient exposure and performed tasks previously assigned to other clinical team members. Conclusion: Roles and nursing practice processes evolved to meet the demand for care despite challenges. Registered nurses require adequate protection for their frontline role which may consist of increased patient exposure compared to clinical colleagues, emotional support, and clear clinical guidance. A deeper understanding of how a public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affects nursing practice can guide future efforts to optimize healthcare structures, nursing care processes, and patient outcomes. Our study can inform strategies for providing registered nurses with adequate communication, protection, and resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and future similar public health emergencies.","Schroeder, Krista; Norful, Allison A; Travers, Jasmine; Aliyu, Sainfer",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,,196

Currently, there is very little information about the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents and associated factors affecting their mental health. The aim of the present study is to determine the severity of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to investigate the associated factors with these symptoms. Methods The present study was conducted with a total of 447 adolescents. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the use of DSM-5 Level 2 Anxiety Scale, DSM-5 Level 2 Depression Scale and National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. The association between age, gender, residential area, presence of COVID-19 in the participant, presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with linear regression analysis. Results The mean age of participants was 15.06, and 38.3% of the participants were male and 61.7% were female. The rate of participants with moderate or high levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms was 28%, 37.6% and 28.5%, respectively. High age and living in an urban area were associated with increased anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms. In addition, female gender was associated with increased depression symptoms, and the presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment was associated with increased anxiety symptoms. Conclusion The present study shows that adolescents have serious levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results emphasize the need for mental health interventions that are appropriate for the characteristics of this age group.","Selçuk, Engin Burak Demir Arzu Çalışkan Erbay Lale Gönenir Özcan Özlem Özel Gürer Hüseyin Dönmez Yunus Emre",International Journal of Clinical Practice,,196

Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end.","Ding, Zhuqing; Xie, Lingling; Guan, Anchen; Huang, Dandan; Mao, Zongfu; Liang, Xiaohui",J Glob Health,,196

362457,"Conflicting evidence on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as the early treatment of COVID-19. Comment on ""Early treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: A retrospective analysis of 1061 cases in Marseille, France""",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether regulatory guidance on the use of dexamethasone in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is applicable to the larger population of COVID-19 cases. The surge in worldwide demand for dexamethasone suggests that the guidance, although correct, has not emphasised the danger of its wider use. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial and the World Health Organisation (WHO) prospective meta-analysis have been deconstructed and analysed. METHODS: To provide context, relevant publications were identified in PubMed using the following keywords: COVID-19, RECOVERY trial, WHO meta-analysis, variants, immunity, public health. RESULTS: The WHO guidance 'Corticosteroids for COVID-19' was based on their prospective meta-analysis. This meta-analysis was weighted by data from the RECOVERY trial. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of COVID-19, dexamethasone has value in a narrow indication, namely, in hospitalised patients requiring respiratory support. The media blitz likely resulted in the wider use of dexamethasone in outpatients and as a preventive medication. This is reflected in the surge in worldwide demand for dexamethasone. We ask whether the use of steroids, beyond regulatory indications, may be responsible for the recent increase in mortality and especially the emergence of mucormycosis? From the public health standpoint, the current guidance for use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 could benefit from clarification and the addition of a cautionary note.","Fernandes, M; Brábek, J",Public Health,,196
362796,Excess Deaths From End-Stage Kidney Disease Early in Pandemic,2021,"Employing the salutogenic model, we asked how individuals in different countries cope with the COVID-19 crisis and stay healthy. We were interested in exploring the individual (i.e. sense of coherence) as well as the social and national resources (i.e. social support, sense of national coherence, and trust in governmental institutions) that could explain levels of mental health and anxiety during the outbreak of the pandemic. Data collection was conducted via convenience sampling on online platforms, during the end of March and the beginning of April 2020. The data included four samples: 640 Israeli participants (319 males), 622 Dutch participants (177 males), 924 Italian participants (338 males) and 489 Spanish participants (117 males); age range of 18-88 years. The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, GAD-7, SOC, SONC). Several questions were adapted to the context of coronavirus and measured levels of exposure to COVID-19, trust in governmental institutions, and social support. The results significantly confirmed the suggested salutogenic model regarding the contribution to individual and national coping resources to anxiety levels and mental health. The patterns of the coping resources in explaining anxiety and mental health were similar in the four samples, and SOC was the main predictor these outcomes. Despite these similarities, a different pattern and also different magnitudes of the predictive value of the coping resources were found for the two different reactions: anxiety vs. mental health. While SOC and situational factors (like financial threat) were significant in explaining anxiety levels, the SOC and national resources were found as significant in explaining mental health levels. The findings support the salutogenic approach in studying reactions during pandemic time. They also shed some light on the difference between pathogenic and salutogenic measures in studying psychological reactions to stressful situations.","Mana, Adi; Super, Sabina; Sardu, Claudia; Juvinya Canal, Dolors; Moran, Neuman; Sagy, Shifra",Glob Health Promot,,196

367380,How Much Covid-19 Will Change the World,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications and infections frequently affect patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients. RESULTS: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.","Silverman, Dustin A; Lin, Chen; Tamaki, Akina; Puram, Sidharth V; Carrau, Ricardo L; Seim, Nolan B; Eskander, Antoine; Rocco, James W; Old, Matthew O; Kang, Stephen Y",Head Neck,,196
370052,"Beyond the AJR: ""Outcomes of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients Recently Recovered From Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)""",2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to analyze the relationship between the initial chest X-ray findings in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and eventual clinical worsening and to compare three systems of quantifying these findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiological evolution of 265 adult patients with COVID-19 attended at our center between March 2020 and April 2020. We recorded data related to patients' comorbidities, hospital stay, and clinical worsening (admission to the ICU, intubation, and death). We used three scoring systems taking into consideration 6 or 8 lung fields (designated 6A, 6B, and 8) to quantify lung involvement in each patient's initial abnormal chest X-ray and to classify its severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and we compared these three systems. We also recorded the presence of alveolar opacities and linear opacities (fundamentally linear atelectasis) in the first chest X-ray with pathologic findings. RESULTS: In the &#967;2 analysis, moderate or severe involvement in the three classification systems correlated with hospital admission (p=0.009 in 6A, p=0.001 in 6B, and p=0.001 in 8) and with death (p=0.02 in 6A, p=0.01 in 6B, and p=0.006 in 8). In the regression analysis, the most significant associations were 6B with alveolar involvement (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.1.-4.7; p=0.025;) and 8 with alveolar involvement (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01.-4.25; p=0.046). No differences were observed in the ability of the three systems to predict clinical worsening by classifications of involvement in chest X-rays as moderate or severe. CONCLUSION: Moderate/severe extension in the three chest X-ray scoring systems evaluating the extent of involvement over 6 or 8 lung fields and the finding of alveolar opacities in the first abnormal X-ray correlated with mortality and the rate of hospitalization in the patients studied. No significant difference was found in the predictive ability of the three classification systems proposed.","Petite Felipe, D J; Rivera Campos, M I; San Miguel Espinosa, J; Malo Rubio, Y; Flores Quan, J C; Cuartero Revilla, M V",Radiologia,,196
373072,Post-coronavirus disease syndrome and disseminated microthrombosis: the role of the von Willebrand factor and antiphospholipid antibodies,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged in China and caused a disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses.","Hatmal, Ma039; mon, M; Alshaer, Walhan; Al-Hatamleh, Mohammad A I; Hatmal, Malik; Smadi, Othman; Taha, Mutasem O; Oweida, Ayman J; Boer, Jennifer C; Mohamud, Rohimah; Plebanski, Magdalena",,,196
373073,Post-coronavirus disease syndrome and disseminated microthrombosis: the role of the von Willebrand factor and antiphospholipid antibodies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a pandemic toward the end of 2019, causing large numbers of people to become infected and die. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific immunoglobulin E tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 61 (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalences of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and episodic wheezing were 10.3%, 6,5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. Although having asthma with or without allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization because of COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to decrease the risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.191; 95% confidence interval, 0.047-0.779; P = .02). Spirometry tests revealed a higher forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio and a peak expiratory flow reversibility in hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized ones (P = .02 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthma and allergic diseases do not seem to be risk factors for hospitalization in children because of COVID-19, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect. Pulmonary function testing seems to be important for monitoring lung damage after COVID-19.","Beken, Burcin; Ozturk, Gokcen Kartal; Aygun, Fatma Deniz; Aydogmus, Cigdem; Akar, Himmet Haluk",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,,196
373472,COVID-19 infection as a trigger for new-onset type 1 diabetes in a susceptible individual - or just coincidence?,2021,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been regarded as a potential tool for the prevalence estimation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the community. However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study provided essential information about the feasibility and accuracy of data-driven estimation of COVID-19 prevalence through the WBE approach.","Li, Xuan; Kulandaivelu, Jagadeeshkumar; Zhang, Shuxin; Shi, Jiahua; Sivakumar, Muttucumaru; Mueller, Jochen; Luby, Stephen; Ahmed, Warish; Coin, Lachlan; Jiang, Guangming",Sci Total Environ,,196

More specifically, we focus on technical challenges and solutions for the implementation of wearable and conformal bioelectronics for long-term patient biomonitoring and discuss their application on the Internet of medical things (IoMT). We first discuss the general architecture of IoMT systems for domiciliary hospitalization and the three layers of the system, including the sensing, communication, and application layers. In regard to the sensing layer, we focus on current trends, recent advances, and challenges in the implementation of stretchable patches. This includes fabrication strategies and solutions for energy storage and energy harvesting, such as printed batteries and supercapacitors. As a case study, we discuss the application of IoMT for domiciliary hospitalization of COVID 19 patients. This can be used as a strategy to reduce the pressure on the healthcare system, as it allows continuous patient monitoring and reduced physical presence in the hospital, and at the same time enables the collection of large data for posterior analysis.

We report the characteristics of patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan city, China, and the risk factors related to infection severity and death. METHODS: We extracted the demographic and clinical data of 7283 patients with severe COVID-19 infection from designated Wuhan hospitals as of 25 February 2020. Factors associated with COVID-19 critical illness and mortality were analysed using logistic- and Cox-regression analyses. RESULTS: We studied 6269 patients with severe COVID-19 illness and 1014 critically ill patients. The median (IQR) age was 64 (53-71) years; 51.2% were male, 38.9% were retirees and 7.4% had self-reported histories of chronic disease. Up to the end of the study, 1180 patients (16.2%) recovered and were discharged, 649 (8.9%) died and the remainder were still receiving treatment. The number of daily confirmed critical cases peaked between 23 January and 1 February 2020.

376126,"An Interprofessional Approach in Caring for a Patient on Maintenance Hemodialysis with COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada: An Educational Case Report",2020,"MAIN CONCLUSION: Principal component and meta-QTL analyses identified genetic loci affecting the trade-off of wheat grain number and size, which could provide opportunities to optimize local breeding strategies for further yield improvement. Grain yield of wheat is complex, and its physiological and genetic bases remain largely unknown. Using the Forno/Oberkulmer recombinant inbred lines, this study validated the negative phenotypic relationships between thousand grain weight (TGW) and grain number components. This trade-off might be alleviated at the population level by early anthesis and at the shoot level by higher shoot biomass. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed three useful PCs, of which both PC1 and PC3 were positively associated with grain yield and grains m-2 through increased spikes m-2 (for PC1) or grains per spike (for PC3), while PC2 primarily reflected the trade-off of grain number and TGW. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping detected eight and seven loci for PC1 and PC2, respectively, on chromosomes 1D, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A and 7B, individually explaining 11.7â29.3% of phenotypic variations. Using the 1203 QTLs published previously, a meta-analysis was performed to reveal 12, 21, 37 and 54 genomic regions (MQTLs) affecting grains m-2, spikes m-2, grains per spike and TGW, respectively. Moreover, 67 MQTLs (96%) for grain number were coincided with the TGW MQTLs, with reverse phenotypic effects, suggesting intensive genetic trade-off between grain number and size. The AGP2 gene, which encodes ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase determining TGW, was found by haplotype analysis in the Forno/Oberkulmer population to affect grain number oppositely, indicating this trade-off at the gene level. Appropriate combinations of the QTLs/genes for local breeding targets, such as higher grain number or larger grains, therefore, would be critical to achieve future yield gains.","Xie, Quan; Sparkes, Debbie L",Planta,,196
376303,"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in three consecutive generations of spread in Zhejiang, China",2020,"With the rapid spread of the pandemic due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has already led to considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide, as well as having a severe impact on economic development. In this article, we analyze the state-level correlation between COVID-19 risk and weather/climate factors in the USA. For this purpose, we consider a spatio-temporal multivariate time series model under a hierarchical framework, which is especially suitable for envisioning the virus transmission tendency across a geographic area over time. Briefly, our model decomposes the COVID-19 risk into: (i) an autoregressive component that describes the within-state COVID-19 risk effect; (ii) a spatiotemporal component that describes the across-state COVID-19 risk effect; (iii) an exogenous component that includes other factors (e.g., weather/climate) that could envision future epidemic development risk; and (iv) an endemic component that captures the function of time and other predictors mainly for individual states. Our results indicate that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, the percentage of cloud coverage, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone have a strong association with the COVID-19 pandemic in many states. In particular, the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone demonstrate statistically significant associations with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading in almost all states. Furthermore, our results from transmission tendency analysis suggest that the community-level transmission has been relatively mitigated in the USA, and the daily confirmed cases within a state are predominated by the earlier daily confirmed cases within that state compared to other factors, which implies that states such as Texas, California, and Florida with a large number of confirmed cases still need strategies like stay-at-home orders to prevent another outbreak.","Rui, Rongxiang; Tian, Maozai; Tang, Man-Lai; Ho, George To-Sum; Wu, Chun-Ho",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,196
376700,Spontaneous Pneumothorax as a Complication of COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Case Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The timing of puberty in girls is occurring at an increasingly early age. While a positive family history is recognised as a predisposing factor for early or precocious puberty, the role of environmental factors is not fully understood. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To make a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of newly diagnosed central precocious puberty (CPP) and the rate of pubertal progression in previously diagnosed patients during and after the Italian lockdown for COVID-19, comparing data with corresponding data from the previous 5 years. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and the use of electronic devices increased during lockdown in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 49 females with CPP. We divided the patients into two groups: group 1, patients presenting a newly diagnosed CPP and group 2, patients with previously diagnosed slow progression CPP whose pubertal progression accelerated during or after lockdown. We collected auxological, clinical, endocrinological and radiological data which were compared with data from two corresponding control groups (patients followed by our Unit, March to July 2015-2019). Patients' families completed a questionnaire to assess differences in the use of electronic devices before and during lockdown. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients presented newly diagnosed CPP (group 1) and 12, with previously diagnosed but untreated slow progression CPP presented an acceleration in the rate of pubertal progression (group 2). The number of new CPP diagnoses was significantly higher than the mean for the same period of the previous 5 years (p < 0.0005). There were no significant differences between patients in group 1 and control group 1 regarding time between appearance of B2 and CPP diagnosis, although group 1 patients had a significantly earlier chronological age at B2, a more advanced Tanner stage at diagnosis (p < 0.005), higher basal LH and E2 levels, higher LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05) and increased uterine length (p < 0.005) and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). The number of patients with previously diagnosed CPP whose pubertal development accelerated was also statistically higher compared to controls (p < 0.0005). In this group, patients' basal LH (p < 0.05) and E2 levels (p < 0.0005) became more markedly elevated as did the LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05). These patients also showed a significantly accelerated progression rate as measured by the Tanner scale (p < 0.0005), uterine length (p < 0.005), and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). In both group 1 and group 2, BMI increased significantly (p < 0.05) and patients' families reported an increased use of electronic devices (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our data show an increased incidence of newly diagnosed CPP and a faster rate of pubertal progression in patients with a previous diagnosis, during and after lockdown compared to previous years. We hypothesize that triggering environmental factors, such as the BMI and the use of electronic devices, were enhanced during lockdown, stressing their possible role in triggering/influencing puberty and its progression. However, more studies are needed to determine which factors were involved and how they interacted.","Stagi, Stefano; De Masi, Salvatore; Bencini, Erica; Losi, Stefania; Paci, Silvia; Parpagnoli, Maria; Ricci, Franco; Ciofi, Daniele; Azzari, Chiara",Ital J Pediatr,,196
377997,A follow-up study confirms day/night enuresis cure in children by squatting-based exercises,2021,"Since the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in 2019, several cities have been blocked to prevent the expansion of the infection. This qualitative study aimed to determine the motives of urban residents for visiting urban green spaces during the epidemic (especially within the context of the city blockade), and what might weaken these motives. In total, 47 residents (17 men and 30 women) were recruited from Chengdu, in China, to participate in interviews. A thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview data. According to the results, the motives of the respondents were divided into strong motives and weak motives. These strong motives for visiting UGS can be divided into four themes: “A place for health”, “Escape”, “Social support”, and “A safe and important place for outdoor activities”. Residents classified as the weak motive primarily considered the reasons of “Keep distance with others”, “Potential infection risk” and “Seek compensation”. The results of this study are significant for current and future urban management, green space planning, and social well-being.","Luo, Shixian Xie Jing Furuya Katsunori",Sustainability,,196

381965,Attitudes and Behaviors of Patients With Rheumatic Diseases During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant disruption of the practice of pharmacy. Importantly, in many parts of the world, this disruption occurred literally overnight, requiring pharmacists to demonstrate significant adaptability and resiliency in order to manage continuing and in some cases expanding needs of patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particular in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential. CONCLUSIONS: Traditionally, resilience in professional practice has been characterized as a personal, not a workplace, issue. This study suggests that personal resiliency for pharmacists requires substantial workplace support; further work in this area is required to better understand how pharmacists adapt to complex and difficult situations such as pandemics.","Austin, Zubin; Gregory, Paul",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,196

METHODS: Infection control guidelines and recommendations from international ophthalmological bodies are reviewed and discussed. The measures at our hospital were drawn up as per international and local health authorities' guidelines and implemented with the collaboration of doctors, nurses and administrative staff. RESULTS: The aims of our infection control measures are to 1) minimize cross-infection within the hospital; 2) protect and support hospital staff; 3) ensure environmental control. To minimize the risk of cross-infection, outpatient attendance and elective surgery have been reduced by 40%, and general anesthesia procedures were reduced by 90%. Patients entering the hospital are screened for fever, travel history, contact and cluster history, and COVID-19 related symptoms. To protect and support hospital staff, we ensure provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide clear guidelines on the level of PPE needed, depending on the clinical situation. Other protective measures include provision of work uniforms, easy access to alcohol-based hand rub, opening new lunch areas, implementation of self-monitoring and self-reporting systems, and communication via online education and updates. Finally, environmental control is achieved by ensuring regular disinfection of the hospital premise, enhancing ventilation, and usage of disposable ophthalmic instruments. CONCLUSION: Our multi-pronged approach to infection control is, so far, successful in minimizing infection risks, while allowing the maintenance of essential ophthalmic services.","Cheung, Stephanie S.L.; Wong, Cherie Y.K.; Chan, Jason C.K.; Chan, Carmen K.M.; Lam, N.

387346,Diabetes Insipidus as a Symptom of Covid-19 Infection: Case Report,2020,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia and other invasive diseases, and is a leading cause of mortality in the elderly population. The present study aimed to provide current antimicrobial resistance and epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 252 nonduplicate S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from patients admitted to 16 hospitals in Taiwan between January 2017 and December 2019, and were analyzed. The minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics was determined using the Vitek 2 automated system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Furthermore, epidemiological profiles of S. pneumoniae infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the strains analyzed, 88% were recognized as invasive pneumococcal strains. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria for non-meningitis, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae demonstrated a declining trend from 43.6% in 2017 to 17.2% in 2019. However, the rate of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 85.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Furthermore, the prevalence of ceftriaxone-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 62.7% based on the criteria for meningitis. Isolates demonstrated higher susceptibility toward doripenem and ertapenem than toward meropenem and imipenem. An increased rate of non-susceptibility toward levofloxacin was observed in southern Taiwan (15.1%) and elderly patients (&#8805;65 years; 11.4%). Most isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSION: Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone monotherapy for pneumococcal meningitis should be carefully monitored owing to its high non-susceptibility rate. The susceptibility rates of most isolates to penicillin (used for treating non-meningitis pneumococcal diseases), carbapenems (ertapenem and doripenem), respiratory quinolones (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin), vancomycin, and linezolid suggested the potential of these antibiotics in treating pneumococcal diseases in Taiwan.","Tsai, Yu-Te; Lee, Yu-Lin; Lu, Min-Chi; Shao, Pei-Lan; Lu, Po-Liang; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Lin, Chi-Ying; Wu, Ting-Shu; Yen, Muh-Yong; Wang, Lih-Shinn; Liu, Chang-Pan; Lee, Wen-Sen; Shi, Zhi-Yuan; Chen, Yao-Shen; Wang, Fu-Der; Tseng, Shu-Hui; Lin, Chao-Nan; Chen, Yu-Hui; Sheng, Wang-Huei; Lee, Chun-Ming; Tang, Hung-Jen; Lin, Chun-Yu; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,196

388902,Recurrent keratoconjunctivitis as the sole manifestation of COVID-19 infection: A case report,2021,"Background and Objectives: Long COVID defines a series of chronic symptoms that patients may experience after resolution of acute COVID-19. Early reports from studies with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical illness-myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment for patients post-COVID is evident. Advancements and standardization of long COVID research methodologies would improve the quality of future research, and may allow further investigations into the similarities and differences between long COVID and ME/CFS.","Wong, Timothy L; Weitzer, Danielle J",Medicina (Kaunas),,196

Understanding what the public know about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based on misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure efforts to reduce viral transmission are not undermined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation in Australia, and changes over time. METHODS: Adults 18 years and over completed a prospective national longitudinal survey in 2020 (n=4362 April; n=1882 May; n=1369 June). RESULTS: Stronger agreement with misinformation was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and language other than English at home (all P<.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (P<.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with men and younger age), causation (associated with lower education and greater social disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater agreement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness, which must be addressed to ensure effective COVID-19 prevention.","Pickles, Kristen; Cvejic, Erin; Nickel, Brooke; Copp, Tessa; Bonner, Carissa; Leask, Julie; Ayre, Julie; Batcup, Carys; Cornell, Samuel; Dakin, Thomas; Dodd, Rachael H; Isautier, Jennifer Mj; McCaffery, Kirsten J",J. med. internet res,,196

Acute Respiratory Discomfort Syndrome (ARDS) is the most common immunopathological event in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. Fast lung deterioration results of cytokine storm determined by a robust immunological response leading to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the possible role of host genetics in the etiology and spreading of the disease.","Gomes, Caio P; Fernandes, Danilo E; Casimiro, Fernanda; da Mata, Gustavo F; Passos, Michelle T; Varela, Patricia; Mastroianni-Kirsztajn, Gianna; Pesquero, João Bosco",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,196

The elective use of one of various possible indicators implies different assessments of risk and, in consequence, different public health measures. Results and discussion show that COVID-19 pandemic management uncovered the lack of inter-and transdisciplinary culture in medicine and public health, as well as the lack of a conceptual framework. In a systemic human ecological view the framework would be expanded, including the link between ecology and medicine.

This study describes its characteristics and the factors that can condition and predict it. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, descriptive, observational study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 between April and May 2020 with muscle weakness. A motor balance equal to or lower than 3/5 according to the modified Medical Research Council muscle strength scale was considered to be severe clinical impairment. Altogether 25 analytical studies, 16 neurophysiological studies and one muscle biopsy were performed, with a telephone follow-up at one month, a comparative analysis between the groups with and without severe compromise, and determination of cut-off points for analytical parameters to predict severe involvement using ROC curves. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 58 years (standard deviation ± 9). The median length of stay in the ICU was 27.5 days. All the electromyograms exhibited a myogenic pattern and 75% also showed neuropathy. The group with severe clinical involvement had higher levels of D-dimer (p = 0.08), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.03) and interleukin-6 (p = 0.10), and the combination of the alteration of any two of these three parameters predicted severe involvement with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76.9%. At one month of follow-up, 36% were unable to walk autonomously and 92% continued with muscle weakness. CONCLUSIONS: Weakness in severe COVID-19 patients has a major clinical impact. Its early detection and study by means of predictors of its development may allow for better management. The absence in some cases of classical risk factors for ICU-acquired weakness suggests a different pathophysiology.","Ballvé, A; Llauradó, A; Palasí, A; Quintana, M; Martínez-Sáez, E; Laínez, E; Raguer, N; Juntas-Morales, R",Rev Neurol,,196

RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P < .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic. The treatment guidelines in the COVID-19 scenario should incorporate patients' perspectives.","Ghosh, Joydeep; Ganguly, Sandip; Mondal, Debapriya; Pandey, Prashant; Dabkara, Deepak; Biswas, Bivas",JCO Glob Oncol,,196

401752,Re-Engineering Academic Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology to Operate in a Pandemic World and Beyond - A Joint AGOS/CUCOG Statement,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is accumulating evidence for an overly activated immune response in severe COVID-19, with several studies exploring the therapeutic role of immunomodulation. Through systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess the effectiveness of specific interleukin inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched on 7 January 2021 to identify studies of immunomodulatory agents (anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were severity on an Ordinal Scale measured at day 15 from intervention and days to hospital discharge. Key secondary endpoints included overall mortality. RESULTS: 71 studies totalling 22 058 patients were included, 6 were randomised trials. Most studies explored outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab (60/71). In prospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with improved unadjusted survival (risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, I2=0.0%), but conclusive benefit was not demonstrated for other outcomes. In retrospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with less severe outcomes on an Ordinal Scale (generalised OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.64, I2=98%) and adjusted mortality risk (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.66, I2=76.6%). The mean difference in duration of hospitalisation was 0.36 days (95% CI -0.07 to 0.80, I2=93.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity in retrospective studies, and estimates should be interpreted cautiously. Other immunomodulatory agents showed similar effects to tocilizumab, but insufficient data precluded meta-analysis by agent. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab was associated with a lower relative risk of mortality in prospective studies, but effects were inconclusive for other outcomes. Current evidence for the efficacy of anakinra, siltuximab or sarilumab in COVID-19 is insufficient, with further studies urgently needed for conclusive findings.

402530,Specific dynamic variations in the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 and severe influenza A patients: a retrospective observational study,2020,"A robot working in human-centric environments needs to know which kind of objects exist in the scene, where they are, and how to grasp and manipulate various objects in different situations to help humans in everyday tasks. Therefore, object recognition and grasping are two key functionalities for such robots. Most state-of-the-art tackles object recognition and grasping as two separate problems while both use visual input. Furthermore, the knowledge of the robot is fixed after the training phase. In such cases, if the robot faces new object categories, it must retrain from scratch to incorporate new information without catastrophic interference. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning architecture with augmented memory capacities to handle open-ended object recognition and grasping simultaneously. In particular, our approach takes multi-views of an object as input and jointly estimates pixel-wise grasp configuration as well as a deep scale- and rotation-invariant representation as outputs. The obtained representation is then used for open-ended object recognition through a meta-active learning technique. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to grasp never-seen-before objects and to rapidly learn new object categories using very few examples on-site in both simulation and real-world settings.","Kasaei, Hamidreza; Luo, Sha; Sasso, Remo; Kasaei, Mohammadreza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01866v1.pdf,196

METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. RESULTS: Fear (p < .001, &#966;c = .11), irritability (p = .001, &#966;c = .08), frustration (p < .001, &#966;c = .10), anger (p = .013, &#966;c = .06), and helplessness (p < .001, &#966;c = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (p = .001, &#966;c = .13 and p = .025, &#966;c = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (p = .024, &#966;c = .10). Having a confirmatory diagnosis of the disease was related to hypochondria sensation (p = .026, &#966;c = .10). Sadness (p = .035, &#966;c = .09), intolerance (p = .058, &#966;c = .09), anger (p = .024, &#966;c = .10), and helplessness (p = .028, &#966;c = .10) appeared as the most relevant emotions when information was perceived as insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of the most prevalent different emotional patterns in HCW, as well as in the general population, will allow the detection of subjects at risk for the development of mental disorders and the implementation of therapeutic approaches in future similar situations of pandemic or outbreak of the current one.

Due to strong restrictions out-of-home movements, we hypothesize that overall physical activity will decrease and sedentary behavior increase. This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity. To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities' prescription, its former benchmarks. This paper supports and comments Anses' Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases. Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.","Margaritis, Irène; Houdart, Sabine; El Ouadrhiri, Youssef; Bigard, Xavier; Vuillemin, Anne; Duché, Pascale",Arch.

Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of the frequency of LQT in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with HCQ. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and preprint servers (medRxiv, Research Square) were searched for studies published between December 2019 and June 30, 2020. Methods Effect statistics were pooled using random effects. The quality of observational studies and randomized controlled trials was appraised with STROBE and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tools, respectively. Outcomes Critical LQT was defined as: (1) maximum QT corrected (QTc)&#8805;500 ms (if QRS<120 ms) or QTc&#8805;550 ms (if QRS&#8805;120 ms), and (2) QTc increase &#8805;60 ms. Results In the 28 studies included (n=9124), the frequency of LQT during HCQ treatment was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-10.2). In 20 studies (n=7825), patients were also taking other QT-prolonging drugs. The frequency of LQT in the other 8 studies (n=1299) was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.3-3.9). Twenty studies (n=6869) reported HCQ discontinuation due to LQT, with a frequency of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.5-6.6). The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias during HCQ treatment was 1.68% (127/7539) and that of arrhythmogenic death was 0.69% (39/5648). Torsades de Pointes occurred in 0.06% (3/5066). Patients aged >60 years were at highest risk of HCQ-associated LQT (P<0.001). Conclusions HCQ-associated cardiotoxicity in SARS-CoV-2 patients is uncommon but requires ECG monitoring, particularly in those aged >60 years and/or taking other QT-prolonging drugs.","Oscanoa, Teodoro J; Vidal, Xavier; Kanters, Jørgen K; Romero-Ortuno, Roman",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,196

415567,Massive Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Two Case Reports,2021,"BackgroundAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommuting has become a new way of working that has not only changed individuals work, but also their health, lifestyle, family and community relationships. However, the impact of telecommuting on diet is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between telecommuting frequency and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA total of 33,302 Japanese workers completed an Internet survey about telecommuting and dietary habits. Data from 13,468 office workers who telecommuted were analyzed. Telecommuting frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic was extracted from a questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of four types of dietary habits, namely, skipping breakfast, solitary eating, lower meal frequency, and meal substitution associated with telecommuting frequency were estimated using multilevel logistic regression. ResultsThe multivariate OR of skipping breakfast was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03-1.29, p=0.013) for participants who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. Similarly, the multivariate OR of solitary eating, lower meal frequency and meal substitution were 1.44 (95%CI: 1.28-1.63, p<0.001), 2.39 (95%CI: 1.66-3.44, p<0.001), and 1.26 (95%CI: 1.04-1.51, p=0.015) for those who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose-response trend in ORs of solitary eating (p for trend <0.001), lower meal frequency (p for trend <0.001), and meal substitution (p for trend =0.001) with increasing telecommuting frequency. ConclusionIncreasing telecommuting frequency was associated with an increasing number of unhealthy dietary habits in Japanese workers. Telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with other social changes such as refraining from going out and socializing, is having a significant impact on workers daily lives and behaviors. This study suggests that in addition to challenges related to physical activity, loneliness, and mental health, telecommuters may also be developing unhealthy dietary habits, indicating the need for strategies to help telecommuters manage their nutrition and diet.

415745,COVID-19 Infection in a Patient with End-Stage Kidney Disease,2020,"The global COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in vessel traffic in many areas around the world, including vessel-based tourism throughout Alaska, USA in 2020. Marine vessel traffic has long been known to affect the underwater acoustic environment with direct and indirect effects on marine ecological processes. Glacier Bay National Park in southeastern Alaska has monitored underwater sound since 2000. We used continuous, calibrated hydrophone recordings to examine 2020 ambient sound levels compared with previous years: 2018, the most recent year with data available, and 2016 for historical perspective. Park tourism occurs mainly in May - September. Overall, the number of vessel entries in Glacier Bay was 44-49% lower in 2020 (2020: n = 1,831;2018: n = 3,599;2016: n = 3,212) affecting all vessel classes, including the complete absence of cruise ships and only three tour vessel trips. In all years, we found clear seasonal and diurnal patterns in vessel generated noise, focused from 06:00-20:00 local time (LT) in the summer months. Broadband (17.8-8,910 Hz) sound levels in the 2020 Visitor Season were 2.7 dB lower than 2018 and 2.5 dB lower than 2016. Focusing on morning (06:00-09:00 LT) and afternoon (15:00-18:00 LT) time-blocks when tour vessels and cruise ships enter and exit Glacier Bay, median broadband sound levels were 3.3-5.1 dB lower in 2020 than prior years. At the 95th percentile levels, morning and afternoon peak times in 2020 were 6.3 to 9.0 dB quieter than previous years. A 3 dB decline in median sound level in the 125 Hz one-third octave band in 2020 reflects a change in medium and large vessel noise energy and/or harbor seal vocalizations. Our results suggest that all types of vessels had a role in the quieter underwater sound environment in 2020, with the combined acoustic footprint of tour vessels and cruise ships most evident in the decrease in the 95th percentile loudest sounds. This and other descriptions of the pandemic-induced quiet, and the gradual return to increased activity, can help inform efforts to improve existing methods to mitigate vessel noise impacts and maintain the ecological integrity of marine protected areas.","Gabriele, Christine M.; Ponirakis, Dimitri W.; Klinck, Holger",Frontiers in Marine Science,,196
417083,Courage in the Face of Catastrophe: COVID-19 in Heart Transplant Recipients Northern Italian Registry,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social isolation, which has a potential negative impact on the educational routines (eg, the suspension of face-to-face appointments) and mental health of medical students. The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of São Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students' educational routines and medical training.

417704,Left Eye Conjunctivitis: An Isolated Presentation of COVID-19 Infection: A Rare Case Report,2021,"BackgroundThe ability to quantify an immune response after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential. This study assessed the clinical utility of the quantitative Roche Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (ACOV2S) using samples from the 2019-nCoV vaccine (mRNA-1273) phase 1 trial (NCT04283461). MethodsSamples from 30 healthy participants, aged 18-55 years, who received two injections with mRNA-1273 at a dose of 25 g (n=15) or 100 g (n=15), were collected at Days 1 (first vaccination), 15, 29 (second vaccination), 43 and 57. ACOV2S results (shown in U/mL - equivalent to BAU/mL per the first WHO international standard) were compared with results from ELISAs specific to antibodies against the Spike protein (S-2P) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as neutralization tests including nanoluciferase (nLUC80), live-virus (PRNT80), and a pseudovirus neutralizing antibody assay (PsVNA50). ResultsRBD-specific antibodies were already detectable by ACOV2S at the first time point of assessment (d15 after first vaccination), with seroconversion before in all but 2 participants (25 g dose group); all had seroconverted by Day 29. Across all post-baseline visits, geometric mean concentration of antibody levels were 3.27-7.48-fold higher in the 100 g compared with the 25 g dose group. ACOV2S measurements were highly correlated with those from RBD ELISA (Pearsons r=0.938; p<0.0001) and S-2P ELISA (r=0.918; p<0.0001). For both ELISAs, heterogeneous baseline results and smaller increases in antibody levels following the second vs first vaccination compared with ACOV2S were observed. ACOV2S showed absence of any baseline noise indicating high specificity detecting vaccine-induced antibody response. Moderate-strong correlations were observed between ACOV2S and neutralization tests (nLUC80 r=0.933; PsVNA50, r=0.771; PRNT80, r=0.672; all p[≤]0.0001). ConclusionThe Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (ACOV2S) can be regarded as a highly valuable method to assess and quantify the presence of RBD-directed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination, and may indicate the presence of neutralizing antibodies. As a fully automated and standardized method, ACOV2S could qualify as the method of choice for consistent quantification of vaccine-induced humoral response.","Jochum, Simon; Kirste, Imke; Hortsch, Sayuri; Grunert, Veit Peter; Legault, Holly; Eichenlaub, Udo; Kashlan, Basel; Pajon, Rolando",,,196

418468,Unexpected Features of Cardiac Pathology in COVID-19 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The nation was recovering from the aftermath of the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfires when the first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Australia. During the peak of the pandemic, Australia closed both its state and international borders to all travelers and interstate travel was very tightly regulated. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were one of the very few primary healthcare workers still serving their communities during these periods of strict lockdown. In this personal view article, the challenges and their toll on the mental health and wellbeing of these ""essential workers"" are described. KEY FINDINGS: Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were under immense pressure to remain open and serve their communities amidst rapidly changing legislation and, at times, conflicting advice from the range of Australian health agencies. Rapid changes to workload and workflow were combined with the dilemma of balancing professional obligations with the personal duty of keeping themselves and their sometimes geographically distant families safe. Fluctuating demands and traumatic situations found community pharmacy staff often feeling distressed and underprepared. SUMMARY: Despite a global pandemic following a season of extraordinary bushfires, it has barely been acknowledged that community pharmacy staff are one of the highest risk groups for long-term psychological impacts. To our knowledge, very little research has addressed the toll of these cataclysmic events on this group of essential healthcare workers.","McCallum, Blake Andrew; Dunkley, Kay; Hotham, Elizabeth; Suppiah, Vijayaprakash",Int J Pharm Pract,,196

Accessibility restriction measures adopted by many countries were a fast and useful response to contain the spread of the virus. Within this topic, the aim of this paper was to support policies and decision makers in the definition of the most appropriate strategies for managing the Covid-19 crisis. Precisely the correlation between the Covid-19 positive cases and the transport accessibility of an area was investigated through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results show that the transport accessibility was the variable that better explained the number of Covid-19 infections (about 40% in weight), meaning that greater is the accessibility of a territorial area, easier the virus reaches its population. Furthermore, other context variables were also significant, i.e. socio-economic, territorial and pollutant variables. Estimated findings underline how the accessibility, that often measures the wealth of a territory, becomes the worst enemy of a territorial area during a pandemic, resulting the main vehicle of contagion among the citizens. These results are original and would allow to define possible policies and/or best practices to better manage mobility restrictions. The quantitative estimations performed show that a possible and probably more sustainable policy for containing social interactions could be to apply lockdowns proportionally to the transport accessibility of the areas, in the sense that greater the accessibility is, greater the mobility restrictive policies must be adopted.","Cartenì, Armando; Di Francesco, Luigi; Martino, Maria",Saf Sci,,196

425152,COVID-19 and Pulmonary Emboli: A Case Series and Literature Review,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 required rapid innovation throughout the healthcare system. Home-based primary care (HBPC) practices faced unique challenges maintaining services for medically complex older populations for whom they needed to adapt a traditionally hands-on, model of care to accommodate restrictions on in-person contact. Our aim was to determine strategies used by New York City (NYC)-area HBPC practices to provide patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of informing planning and preparation for home-based practices nationwide. DESIGN: Cross-sectional qualitative design using semi-structured interviews. SETTING: HBPC practices in the NYC metro area during spring 2020. PARTICIPANTS: HBPC leadership including clinical/medical directors, program managers, nurse practitioners/nursing coordinators, and social workers/social work coordinators (n = 13) at 6 NYC-area practices. MEASUREMENTS: Semi-structured interviews explored HBPC practices' COVID-19 care delivery challenges, adaptations, and advice for providers. Interviewers probed patient care, end-of-life care, telehealth, community-based services and staffing. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed through a combined inductive and deductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Participants described care delivery and operational adaptations similar to those universally adopted across healthcare settings during COVID-19, such as patient outreach and telehealth. HBPC-specific adaptations included mental health services for patients experiencing depression and isolation, using multiple modalities of patient interactions to balance virtual care with necessary in-person contact, strategies to maintain patient trust, and supporting team connection of staff through daily huddles and emotional support during the surge of deaths among long-standing patients. CONCLUSION: NYC-area HBPC providers adapted care delivery and operations rapidly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping older, medically complex patients safe in their homes required considerable flexibility, transparency, teamwork, and partnerships with outside providers. As the pandemic continues to surge around the United States, HBPC providers may apply these lessons and consider resources needed to prepare for future challenges.","Franzosa, Emily; Gorbenko, Ksenia; Brody, Abraham A; Leff, Bruce; Ritchie, Christine S; Kinosian, Bruce; Ornstein, Katherine A; Federman, Alex D",J. am. geriatr. soc,,196

This study aimed to survey the impact of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain using an exploratory sequential mixed design. We first addressed those stages of the poultry supply chain disrupted in an ongoing pandemic, and then elaborated particular disturbances associated with each stage. This study was based on data collected from Iranian poultry industry owners and experts who had sufficient experience in agricultural supply chains as well. As the qualitative phase, the content analysis was conducted to identify the impacts of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain. The results and conclusions that emerged from the qualitative phase were refined and weighted by the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) respectively, in the quantitative phase. The results suggested that the pandemic has further affected the input supply as a stage in the poultry supply chain. This is probably because of the fact that the poultry industry is heavily dependent on inputs' flow. In addition, supply chain governance was seriously impaired due to the persistence of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly affected the stages that are most reliant on transportation. Finally, we found that a part of the disruptions that occur in the downstream of the supply chain is due to the epidemic's direct adverse effects, and another part is due to indirect consequences received from the upstream. Our findings and implications can be useful in decision-making procedures during ongoing epidemics.","Palouj, Mojtaba; Adaryani, Rasool Lavaei; Alambeigi, Amir; Movarej, Maryam; Sis, Yahya Safi",Food Control,,196

430011,Selective Lobe Ventilation and a Novel Platform for Pulmonary Drug Delivery,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality, and finding new treatments is critical. Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm. Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions. We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS: Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.","Staats, Peter; Giannakopoulos, Georgios; Blake, Justyna; Liebler, Eric; Levy, Robert M",Neuromodulation,,196

431726,Economic impact of Coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic on vascular surgeons in India,2020,"Since the emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a number of reports have pointed out an increased coagulation activity in these patients mostly during acute phase of the disease. We are reporting a case of acute superior mesenteric thrombosis in a 55-year-old male with NCP one week after hospital discharge. He returned to the emergency department 7 days later with severe acute abdominal pain and found to have superior mesenteric artery thrombosis. He subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, SMA thrombectomy and bowel resection. Acute arterial thrombosis may occur in post hospitalization period in patients with NPC. Since the emergence of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in December 2019, a number of reports have suggested that a large percentage of patients with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection , particularly those that become critically ill, develop a pro-thrombotic state which places them at a significantly increased risk of thrombosis especially during the acute phase that often requires intensive care unit stay with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1, 2, 3 Interestingly, a wide range of increase in D-dimer levels has also been documented in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and there are early reports linking higher D-dimer levels to worse outcomes.4 Based on these reports, most centers employ thrombosis-prevention strategies ranging from prophylactic regimens to full anticoagulation during NCP hospitalization with improved outcomes.5 The optimal potency and duration of anti-thrombotic management is not clear. In addition, there is little evidence on when the increased coagulation activity returns to normal levels after onset of symptoms. We report a case of acute mesenteric ischemia due to superior mesenteric artery thrombosis in a 55-year-old male patient with NCP one week after hospital discharge. The patient consent to publish the case report was obtained according to our institutional guidelines.","Bannazadeh, Mohsen; Tassiopoulos, Apostolos; Koullias, George",,,196

432082,Does COVID-19 cause an increased risk of hospitalisation or death in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs?,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided a unique set of global supply chain limitations with an exponentially growing surge of patients requiring care. The needs for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for hospital staff and doctors have been overwhelming, even just to rule out patients not infected. High demand for traditionally manufactured devices, challenged by global demand and limited production, has resulted in a call for additive manufactured (3D printed) equipment to fill the gap between traditional manufacturing cycles. This method has the unique ability to pivot in real time, while traditional manufacturing may take months to change production runs. 3D printing has been used to produce a variety of equipment for hospitals including face shields, masks, and even ventilator components to handle the surge. This type of rapid, crowd sourced, design and production resulted in new challenges for regulation, liability, and distribution. This manuscript reviews these challenges and successes of additive manufacturing and provides a forward plan for hospitals to consider for future surge events. Recommendations: To accommodate future surges, hospitals and municipalities should develop capacity for short-run custom production, enabling them to validate new designs. This will rapidly increase access to vetted equipment and critical network sharing with community distributed manufacturers and partners. Clear guidance and reviewed design repositories by regulatory authorities will streamline efforts to combat future pandemic waives or other surge events.","Manero, Albert; Smith, Peter; Koontz, Amanda; Dombrowski, Matt; Sparkman, John; Courbin, Dominique; Chi, Albert",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,196

This paper demonstrates a new approach to support the prioritization of cycling infrastructure and cycling network design, accounting for cyclist preferences and the growing emphasis on 'filtered permeability' and 'Low Traffic Neighborhood' interventions internationally. The approach combines distance decay, route calculation, and network analysis methods to examine where future cycling demand is most likely to arise, how such demand could be accommodated within existing street networks, and how to ensure a fair distribution of investment. Although each of these methods has been applied to cycling infrastructure prioritization in previous research, this is the first time that they have been combined, creating an integrated road segment prioritization approach. The approach, which can be applied to other cities, as shown in the Appendix, is demonstrated in a case study of Manchester, resulting in cycling networks that balance directness against the need for safe and stress-free routes under different investment scenarios. A key benefit of the approach from a policy perspective is its ability to support egalitarian and cost-effective strategic cycle network planning.","Mahfouz, Hussein; Arcaute, Elsa; Lovelace, Robin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03712v1.pdf,196

Protectin DX (PDX), an endogenous lipid mediator, shows anti-inflammatory and proresolution bioactions. In vivo, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with PDX (0.1 µg/mouse) after intratracheal (1 mg/kg) or intraperitoneal (10 mg/kg) LPS administration. Flow cytometry was used to measure inflammatory cell numbers. Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete resident macrophages. RT-PCR, and ELISA was used to measure MIP-2, MCP-1, TNF-&#945; and MMP9 levels. In vitro, sorted neutrophils, resident and recruited macrophages (1 × 106 ) were cultured with 1 µg/mL LPS and/or 100 nmol/L PDX to assess the chemokine receptor expression. PDX attenuated LPS-induced lung injury via inhibiting recruited macrophage and neutrophil recruitment through repressing resident macrophage MCP-1, MIP-2 expression and release, respectively. Finally, PDX inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and transmembrane was associated with TNF-&#945;/MIP-2/MMP9 signalling pathway. These data suggest that PDX attenuates LPS-stimulated lung injury via reduction of the inflammatory cell recruitment mediated via resident macrophages.","Ye, Yang; Zhang, Hua-Wei; Mei, Hong-Xia; Xu, Hao-Ran; Xiang, Shu-Yang; Yang, Qian; Zheng, Sheng-Xing; Gao Smith, Fang; Jin, Sheng-Wei; Wang, Qian",J. cell. mol. med,,196

Associated complications have added to the negative prognosis. Nevertheless, many have fully recovered, even among the most fragile. Factors associated with their survival was investigated. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged &#8805;90 years admitted for COVID-19 to the Internal Medicine wards of two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. RESULTS: Among 34 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 33 (97.1%) had respiratory failure. Eighteen patients (52.9%) survived and 16 (47.1%) died during hospital stay. Survivors compared to deceased had a significantly longer hospitalization (19 vs. 10 days respectively; p = 0.02), a better PaO2:FiO2 ratio (241 vs. 171 respectively; p = 0.003), higher lymphocyte counts (p = 0.01) and lower serum LDH levels (p < 0.001) at admission. At multivariate analysis only higher PaO2:FiO2 was associated with survival (OR 1.06 [95%CI 1.0-1.03]; p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in event-free survival between patients treated or not with LMWH (p < 0.0001) and between those treated or not with beta-blockers (p = 0.008). Cox regression, performed in the subgroup of patients who received LMWH, did not show significant difference for sex (HR 2.7 [95% CI 0.53-14.3], p = 0.23), CCI (HR 0.7 [95% CI 0.37-1.45], p = 0.38), PaO2:FiO2 ratio (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97-1.0], p = 0.07), corticosteroid therapy (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.22-4.5], p = 0.99) and beta-blocker therapy (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.56-14,7], p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher mortality in elderly, treatment with LMWH and betablockers might be associated with better survival. Dedicated studies are required to confirm our result.","Saifi, Erkin Saeed; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Salvetti, Massimo; Maninetti, Letizia; Cavalli, Ilaria; Muiesan, Maria L",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,196

METHODS: A quantitative correlational research study was conducted, using a web-based survey. RESULTS: 1576 participants were involved: 1018 women (64.6%) and 558 men (35.4%). A significant decline in the mean wellbeing scores during the quarantine, compared to before, was reported. A positive correlation between the wellbeing scores and the number of sexual intercourse (SI) before and during the quarantine was found. The mean number of SI decreased significantly during the quarantine. The main reasons were: poor privacy (43.2%) and lack of psychological stimuli (40.9%). 1124 respondents (71.3%) did not report sexual desire (SD) reduction. A positive association between SD and SI during the quarantine was found. 61.2% did not report autoerotism reduction. In those who reported decreased masturbation activity, the main causes were poor privacy (46.4%) and lack of desire (34.7%). We found that men presented lower SD during the quarantine, than women (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Potentially, the more time available might lead couples to reconnect at an intimate level and to improve their sexuality. However, the majority of quarantined participants experienced reduced number of SI per week, with poor household privacy and lack of psychological stimuli as cited causes, even as a majority did not report reduced autoeroticism.","Cito, Gianmartin; Micelli, Elisabetta; Cocci, Andrea; Polloni, Gaia; Russo, Giorgio Ivan; Coccia, Maria Elisabetta; Simoncini, Tommaso; Carini, Marco; Minervini, Andrea; Natali, Alessandro",Urology,,196

Innumerable lives have been lost to this novel infectious disease, the nature of which supersedes conventional medical understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a global health crisis, several aspects of life in the post-COVID-19 era are also being contemplated. Experts in unison are warning that the upcoming changes in all areas of life could potentially be far more drastic than ever experienced in the entire human civilization. The medical community is no exception, and therefore, personnel involved in forensic medicine also need to be adequately prepared for the future. Forensic medicine is a branch of medicine dedicated to one of the most important stages of the human lifecycle and has always been at the forefront in times of unprecedented social change. The autopsy, one of the most important tools of forensic medicine, is also useful to infectious diseases because it identifies the causal relationship between death and infection, reveals medical and epidemiological knowledge, and provides objective evidence for legal disputes. We present new autopsy guidelines in forensic medicine, formulated based on the various infectious diseases that we presently live with and may encounter in the future. In formulation of these guidelines several considerations have been taken into account, namely, the role forensic pathologists should play in the post-COVID-19 era and the necessary preparations as well as the support needed from society to fulfill that role. The present COVID-19 outbreak should be a starting point for formulating improvements in current practices in forensic science, including autopsy biosafety practices and the medicolegal death investigation system.","Kim, Moon Young; Cheong, Harin; Kim, Hyung Seok",J Korean Med Sci,,196

More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H; Llorca, P-M; Drapier, D; Fakra, E; Hingray, C; Meyer, G; Dizet, S; Egron, A; Straczek, C; Roser, M; Masson, M; Gaillard, R; Fossati, P; Haffen, E",Encephale,,196

450196,Risk and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors,2020,"Background There are serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of medical education in its current format during serious crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To explore academic, financial, psychological, & hygienic impact on medical students. Methods A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of students at different medical schools in Jordan. It included both basic and clinical years. Results There were 415 responses. Females constituted 51.8%. Around 50% of the participants were from the 6th year (n = 194, 46.7%). University of Jordan students represented around 40% of the responders. 60% of the students have GPA (Grade Point Average) of less than 3 points. Nearly half of the students indicated that their academic grades were affected during the pandemic. Clinical years’ students (51.0%) were more likely to be negatively affected than students in basic years (36.1%), P value 0.026. Sixty three percent reported that they sanitize their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth. More than two thirds (70.4%) of students indicated that their mental health was affected in the pandemic. Financial influence was a major aspect in around 53% of students and 34% of students were not able to pay the university fees due to the pandemic. The pandemic affected the elective training course location of 70.9% of respondents. Mental health was affected in 70.9% of students and 65.1% became more anxious or depressed with no significant difference among gender and academic years (P values 0.256 and 0.516, respectively). Students in the clinical years were more afraid of getting the infection than students in the basic years, however this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.084). Conclusions Covid-19 Pandemic negatively affected the academic course of the medical students especially at the clinical training years’ level across Jordanian universities. COVID-19 pandemic left a negative impact on psychological & mental health of the students, too, rendering them more anxious, depressed, and afraid of coming to the hospital and handling patients.","Al-Husban, Naser Alkhayat Aysha Aljweesri Mariam Alharbi Reem Aljazzaf Zahraa Al-Husban Nehad Elmuhtaseb Mohammed S.; Al Oweidat, Khaled Obeidat Nail",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,,196

According to Bekenstein's quantization, we find that black hole area discretization can have observable imprints on the gravitational wave signal from an inspiraling binary black hole. We study the impact of quantization on tidal heating. We model the absorption lines and compute gravitational wave flux due to tidal heating in such a case. By including the quantization we find the dephasing of the gravitational wave, to our knowledge it has never been done before. We discuss the observability of the phenomena in different parameter ranges of the binary. We show that in the inspiral, it leads to vanishing tidal heating for the high spin values. Therefore measuring non-zero tidal heating can rule out area quantization. We also argue that if area quantization is present in nature then our current modeling with reflectivity can possibly probe the Hawking radiation which may bring important information regarding the quantum nature of gravity.","Datta, Sayak; Phukon, Khun Sang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11140v3.pdf,196
451997,Treatment Options for COVID-19 in Patients with Reduced or Absent Kidney Function,2020,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has brought about tests from many manufacturers. While molecular and rapid antigen tests are targeted for early diagnosis, immunoassays have a larger role in epidemiological studies, understanding longitudinal immunity, and in vaccine development and response. METHODS: The performance of the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay was evaluated against the Beckman ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in New Mexico, and against the Siemens ADVIA Centaur COV2G assay in New York. Discordant samples were parsed using a microneutralization assay. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate of 23.8% was observed in the samples tested in New York (September 2020), while in the same month the positivity rate was 1.5% in New Mexico. Positive and negative agreement were 67.6% (95% CI 49.5-82.6%) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.5-99.9%), respectively, with the Beckman test, and 98.0% (95% CI 95.7-99.3%) and 94.8% (95% CI 93.4-96.0%), respectively, with the Siemens test. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies discloses an AUC, area under the curve, of 0.996 (95% CI 0.992-0.999) for the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. The criterion associated to the Youden Index was determined to be >12.9 kAU/L with a sensitivity of 99.44% and a specificity of 99.82%. CONCLUSIONS: The LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay is highly sensitive and specific. The balance of these parameters, without emphasis on high specificity alone, is particularly important when applied to high prevalence populations, where a highly sensitive assay will result in reporting a lower number of false negative subjects.","Bonelli, Fabrizio; Blocki, Frank A; Bunnell, Tina; Chu, Edward; De La O, Arriel; Grenache, David G; Marzucchi, Ginevra; Montomoli, Emanuele; Okoye, Lilian; Pallavicini, Luca; Streva, Vincent A; Torelli, Alessandro; Wagner, Aaron; Zanin, Davide; Zierold, Claudia; Wassenberg, James J",Clin. chem. lab. med,,196
452881,Low risk of severe COVID­19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: keep calm and take stock,2021,"This paper demonstrates the potentials of the long short-term memory (LSTM) when applyingwith macroeconomic time series data sampled at different frequencies. We first present how theconventional LSTM model can be adapted to the time series observed at mixed frequencies when thesame mismatch ratio is applied for all pairs of low-frequency output and higher-frequency variable. Togeneralize the LSTM to the case of multiple mismatch ratios, we adopt the unrestricted Mixed DAtaSampling (U-MIDAS) scheme (Foroni et al., 2015) into the LSTM architecture. We assess via bothMonte Carlo simulations and empirical application the out-of-sample predictive performance. Ourproposed models outperform the restricted MIDAS model even in a set up favorable to the MIDASestimator. For real world application, we study forecasting a quarterly growth rate of Thai realGDP using a vast array of macroeconomic indicators both quarterly and monthly. Our LSTM withU-MIDAS scheme easily beats the simple benchmark AR(1) model at all horizons, but outperformsthe strong benchmark univariate LSTM only at one and six months ahead. Nonetheless, we find thatour proposed model could be very helpful in the period of large economic downturns for short-termforecast. Simulation and empirical results seem to support the use of our proposed LSTM withU-MIDAS scheme to nowcasting application.","Kamolthip, Sarun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13777v1.pdf,196
452882,Low risk of severe COVID­19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: keep calm and take stock,2021,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced existing medical systems for automatic disease diagnosis. However, a threat to these systems arises that adversarial attacks make CNNs vulnerable. Inaccurate diagnosis results make a negative influence on human healthcare. There is a need to investigate potential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On the other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT, fundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different from others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed method.","Qi, Gege; Gong, Lijun; Song, Yibing; Ma, Kai; Zheng, Yefeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05232v1.pdf,196

Rapid progression of the outbreak has led to a major global public health problem of a potentially fatal disease. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the pandemic as the sixth public health emergency of the world. Upon this, the whole country has started to take the necessary precautions. The new coronavirus uses membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into the cells, such as SARS-CoV, and mostly affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever (93%), fatigue (70%), cough (70%), anorexia (40%) and dyspnoea (34.5%). The elderly and people with underlying chronic diseases are more susceptible to infection and higher mortality. Currently, a large number of drugs and vaccines studies are ongoing.

454828,Myocarditis in COVID-19 presenting with cardiogenic shock: a case series,2021,"For nearly two decades, coronaviruses have caused many health and economic problems, while no effective commercial vaccine has yet been developed. It is worth mentioning that despite some mutations and recombination in SARS-CoV-2, its genotype is very close to the original strain from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be promising. It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement is may threaten vaccinated people's lives and long-term side effect must be considered. To this end, targeting of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) in spike and not whole spike, glycolization of FC receptors, PD-1 blockers, CPPs, etc. are promising. Therefore, the subunit vaccines or RNA vaccines that encode the RBP segment of the spike are of interest. To enhance the vaccine efficacy, its co-delivery with an adjuvant has been recommended. Nanoparticles modulate immune response with higher efficiency than the soluble form of antigens and can be functionalized with the positively charged moieties and ligands of targeted cells, such as dendritic cells, to increase cellular uptake of the antigens and their presentation on the surface of immune cells. This research aimed to discuss the COVID-19 vaccines entering the clinical trial and their mode of action effective immunity against the virus and discusses their advantages compared to each other.","Tavakol, Shima; Alavijeh, Mo S; Seifalian, Alexander M",Curr. pharm. des,,196

The pregnant population is also another concern for health care professionals. There are physiological changes related to pregnancy that result in different laboratory levels, radiological findings and disease progression. The goal of the present article is to determine whether the laboratory results and radiological findings were different in non-pregnant women (NPWs) of reproductive age and pregnant women (PWs) diagnosed with the Covid-19 infection. METHODS: Out of 34 patients, 15 (44.11%) PWs and 19 (55.8%) NPWs were included in the study. Age, comorbidities, complaints, vitals, respiratory rates, computed tomography (CT) findings and stages, as well as laboratory parameters, were recorded from the hospital database. RESULTS: The mean age of the PWs was of 27.6 ± 0.99 years, and that of the NPWs was of 37.63 ± 2.00; when age was compared between the groups, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was found. The mean systolic blood pressure of the PWs was of 116.53 ± 11.35, and that of the NPWs was of 125.53 ± 13.00, and their difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). The difference in the minimum respiratory rates of the patients was also statistically significant (p = 0.05). The platelet levels observed among the PWs with Covid-19 were lower than those of the NPWs (185.40 ± 39.09 × 109/mcL and 232.00 ± 71.04 × 109/mcL respectively; p = 0.05). The mean D-dimer value of the PWs was lower in comparison to that of the NPWs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The laboratory findings and imaging studies may differ between pregnant and non-pregnant populations. It is important to properly interpret these studies. Future studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these preliminary data.","Ozer, Kadir Burak; Sakin, Onder; Koyuncu, Kazibe; Cimenoglu, Berk; Demirhan, Recep",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,,196
465307,Telemedicine: a useful tool but not the holy grail. Response to: 'Telemedicine will not keep us apart in the COVID-19 pandemic' by Perniola et al,2020,"BACKGROUND: Throughout March 2020, leaders in countries across the world were making crucial decisions about how and when to implement public health interventions to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). They urgently needed tools to help them to explore what will work best in their specific circumstances of epidemic size and spread, and feasible intervention scenarios. OBJECTIVE: We sought to rapidly develop a flexible, freely available simulation model for use by modelers and researchers to allow investigation of how various public health interventions implemented at various time points might change the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS: ""COVOID"" (COVID-19 Open-Source Infection Dynamics) is a stochastic individual contact model (ICM), which extends the ICMs provided by the open-source EpiModel package for the R statistical computing environment. To demonstrate its use and inform urgent decisions on March 30, 2020, we modeled similar intervention scenarios to those reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as novel scenarios. The scenarios involved isolation of cases, moderate social distancing, and stricter population ""lockdowns"" enacted over varying time periods in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people. On April 30, 2020, we simulated the epidemic curve for the three contiguous local areas (population 287,344) in eastern Sydney, Australia that recorded 5.3% of Australian cases of COVID-19 through to April 30, 2020, under five different intervention scenarios and compared the modeled predictions with the observed epidemic curve for these areas. RESULTS: COVOID allocates each member of a population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID on March 30, 2020, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by others. The simulated curve for three local areas of Sydney from March 1 to April 30, 2020, was similar to the observed epidemic curve in terms of peak numbers of cases, total numbers of cases, and duration under a scenario representing the public health measures that were actually enacted, including case isolation and ramp-up of testing and social distancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVOID allows rapid modeling of many potential intervention scenarios, can be tailored to diverse settings, and requires only standard computing infrastructure.

466541,A Case Series of Black and Hispanic COVID-19 Patients Treated with ECMO,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcome by performing a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, perinatal and neonatal outcome. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data up to and including 20 April 2020 (studies were identified through PubMed alert after that date). For the search strategy, combinations of the following keywords and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were used: 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus disease 2019', 'pregnancy', 'gestation', 'maternal', 'mother', 'vertical transmission', 'maternal-fetal transmission', 'intrauterine transmission', 'neonate', 'infant' and 'delivery'. Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient being pregnant on admission and availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcome. Exclusion criteria were non-peer-reviewed or unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study, suspicion of duplicate reporting and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied. RESULTS: We identified a high number of relevant case reports and case series, but only 24 studies, including a total of 324 pregnant women with COVID-19, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review. These comprised nine case series (eight consecutive) and 15 case reports. A total of 20 pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the case reports. In the combined data from the eight consecutive case series, including 211 (71.5%) cases of laboratory-confirmed and 84 (28.5%) of clinically diagnosed COVID-19, the maternal age ranged from 20 to 44 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath, fatigue and myalgia. The rate of severe pneumonia reported amongst the case series ranged from 0% to 14%, with the majority of the cases requiring admission to the intensive care unit. Almost all cases from the case series had positive computed tomography chest findings. All six and 22 cases that had nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or termination were reported. In the consecutive case series, 219/295 women had delivered at the time of reporting and 78% of them had Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at both 1 and 5 min ranged from 7 to 10. Only eight neonates had birth weight < 2500 g and nearly one-third of neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. There was one case of neonatal asphyxia and death. In 155 neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, all, except three cases, were negative for SARS-CoV-2. There were no cases of maternal death in the eight consecutive case series. Seven maternal deaths, four intrauterine fetal deaths (one with twin pregnancy) and two neonatal deaths (twin pregnancy) were reported in a non-consecutive case series of nine cases with severe COVID-19. In the case reports, two maternal deaths, one neonatal death and two cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are insufficient good-quality data to draw unbiased conclusions with regard to the severity of the disease or specific complications of COVID-19 in pregnant women, as well as vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal complications. In order to answer specific questions in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses, through meaningful good-quality research, we urge researchers and investigators to present complete outcome data and reference previously published cases in their publications, and to record such reporting when the data of a case are entered into one or several registries. © 2020 The Authors.

To determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected e-cigarette use among young people in the United States.Methods. Data came from a weekly cross-sectional online survey of youths and young adults (aged 15-24 years). Logistic regression analyses measured odds of past-30-day e-cigarette use (n = 5752) following widespread stay-at-home directives (March 14-June 29, 2020), compared with the preâCOVID-19 period (January 1-March 13, 2020). Logistic regression among a subsample of current e-cigarette users (n = 779) examined factors associated with reduced use following stay-at-home orders.Results. Odds of current e-cigarette use were significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preâCOVID-19 period among youths aged 15 to 17 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54, 0.96) and young adults aged 18 to 20 years (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52, 0.81). E-cigarette users with reduced access to retail environments had higher odds of reporting reduced e-cigarette use (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.14).Conclusions. COVID-19 stay-at-home directives present barriers to e-cigarette access and are associated with a decline in e-cigarette use among young people.Public Health Implications. Findings support the urgent implementation of interventions that reduce underage access to e-cigarettes to accelerate a downward trajectory of youth and young adult e-cigarette use.","Kreslake, Jennifer M; Simard, Bethany J; O039,; Connor, Katie M; Patel, Minal; Vallone, Donna M; Hair, Elizabeth C",Am J Public Health,,196

DESIGN: Simulations of provisional mortality data. SETTING: US and 16 other high income countries in 2010-18 and 2020, by sex, including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. POPULATION: Data for the US and for 16 other high income countries from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Human Mortality Database, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, and at ages 25 and 65, by sex, and, in the US only, by race and ethnicity. Analysis excluded 2019 because life table data were not available for many peer countries. Life expectancy in 2020 was estimated by simulating life tables from estimated age specific mortality rates in 2020 and allowing for 10% random error. Estimates for 2020 are reported as medians with fifth and 95th centiles. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2018, the gap in life expectancy between the US and the peer country average increased from 1.88 years (78.66 v 80.54 years, respectively) to 3.05 years (78.74 v 81.78 years). Between 2018 and 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased by 1.87 years (to 76.87 years), 8.5 times the average decrease in peer countries (0.22 years), widening the gap to 4.69 years. Life expectancy in the US decreased disproportionately among racial and ethnic minority groups between 2018 and 2020, declining by 3.88, 3.25, and 1.36 years in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, reductions in life expectancy were 18 and 15 times the average in peer countries, respectively. Progress since 2010 in reducing the gap in life expectancy in the US between Black and White people was erased in 2018-20; life expectancy in Black men reached its lowest level since 1998 (67.73 years), and the longstanding Hispanic life expectancy advantage almost disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The US had a much larger decrease in life expectancy between 2018 and 2020 than other high income nations, with pronounced losses among the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations. A longstanding and widening US health disadvantage, high death rates in 2020, and continued inequitable effects on racial and ethnic minority groups are likely the products of longstanding policy choices and systemic racism.","Woolf, Steven H; Masters, Ryan K; Aron, Laudan Y",BMJ,,196

A network method was also used to depict structural changes more intuitively. Furthermore, we calculated and compared changes in the hedge ratio, optimal portfolio weights, and hedge effectiveness to guide investors to adjust portfolio strategies during COVID-19. The main findings are as follows: First, COVID-19 had a significant impact on spillover effects, and the total connectedness index increased by an average of 19.94%. Second, the energy market was an important risk recipient of the stock market before COVID-19, and the extent of risk acceptance increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Third, the hedging ratio, optimal portfolio weights, and hedge effectiveness showed huge changes after the COVID-19 outbreak, requiring investors to adjust their portfolio strategies.","Zhang, Hua Chen Jinyu Shao Liuguo",International Review of Financial Analysis,,196

468679,Incidence and risk factors of COVID-19-like symptoms in the French general population during the lockdown period: a multi-cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a widely prevalent yet manageable condition that has been linked to neurocognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple barriers hinder older individuals from being diagnosed with ARHL through pure-tone audiometry. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the closure of many outpatient audiology and otolaryngology offices. Smartphone-based hearing assessment apps may overcome these challenges by enabling patients to remotely self-administer their own hearing examination. The objective of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of current mobile health applications (apps) that claim to assess hearing. DESIGN: Narrative review. MEASUREMENTS: The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were queried for apps that claim to assess hearing. Relevant apps were downloaded and used to conduct a mock hearing assessment. Names of included apps were searched on four literature databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) to determine which apps had been validated against gold standard methods. RESULTS: App store searches identified 44 unique apps. Apps differed with respect to the type of test offered (e.g., hearing threshold test), cost, strategies to reduce ambient noise, test output (quantitative vs qualitative results), and options to export results. Validation studies were identified for seven apps. CONCLUSION: Given their low cost and relative accessibility, smartphone-based hearing apps may facilitate screening for ARHL, particularly in the setting of limitations on in-person medical care due to COVID-19. However, app features vary widely, few apps have been validated, and user-centered designs for older adults are largely lacking. Further research and validation efforts are necessary to determine whether smartphone-based hearing assessments are a feasible and accurate screening tool for ARHL. Key Points Age-related hearing loss is a prevalent yet undertreated condition among older adults. Why Does this Paper Matter? Smartphone-based hearing test apps may facilitate remote screening for hearing loss, but limitations surrounding app validation, usability, equipment calibration, and data security should be addressed.","Irace, Alexandria L; Sharma, Rahul K; Reed, Nicholas S; Golub, Justin S",J Am Geriatr Soc,,196
469315,Thrombosis and thromboembolism related to COVID-19: A clarion call for obtaining solid estimates from large-scale multicenter data,2020,"BACKGROUND: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, in-depth knowledge of specific supporting factors and barriers is required. Conditions and structures of caring for people with dementia differ widely, depending on the country and the care context. Our study aimed to describe the experiences and opinions of nursing experts and managers with regard to facilitators and barriers to the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using individual interviews based on qualitative vignettes as a useful stimulus to generate narrations allowing to study peoples' perceptions and beliefs. The study took place in nursing homes in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein using purposive sampling. We intended to conduct the interviews face-to-face in a quiet room according to the participant's choice. However, due to the lockdown of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, we performed interviews face-to-face and by video. We analysed data thematically following Braun and Clarke to achieve a detailed, nuanced description. To verify our interpretation and to ensure congruence with participants' perspectives, we conducted member checks. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) served to structure our manuscript. RESULTS: Six dyads of nursing home managers and nursing experts from six nursing homes took part in our study (n = 12). Our thematic analysis yielded seven themes reflecting facilitators and barriers to implementing nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care: «A common attitude and cohesion within the organization¼, «Commitment on several levels¼, «A needs-oriented implementation¼, «The effect and the public perception of the intervention¼, «A structured and guided implementation process¼, «Supporting knowledge and competencies¼, as well as «Resources for implementing the intervention¼. CONCLUSIONS: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, active commitment-building seems essential. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible.Commitment-building is the precondition to reach the persons involved, such as nursing home managers, nursing staff, residents and relatives. Furthermore, nurses should precisely inform about the intervention. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible. In addition, nurses should adjust the interventions to the situational needs of people with dementia, thus. Therefore, it is important to support dementia-specific competencies in long-term care. Findings indicate that the barrier is determined by the intervention and its implementation - and not by the behaviour of the person with dementia.","Hirt, Julian; Karrer, Melanie; Adlbrecht, Laura; Saxer, Susi; Zeller, Adelheid",BMC Geriatr,,196

Here, we validate the identity of cancer cell lines in three pharmacogenomic studies and screen for genetic drift within and between datasets. Using SNP data from these datasets encompassing 1,497 unique cell lines and 63 unique pharmacological compounds, we show that genetic drift is widely prevalent in almost all cell lines with a median of 4.5%-6.1% of the total genome size drifted between any two isogenic cell lines. This study highlights the need for molecular profiling of cell lines to minimize the effects of passaging or misidentification in biomedical studies. We developed the CCLid web application, available at www.cclid.ca, to allow users to screen the genomic profiles of their cell lines against these datasets.

476626,"A Simple Epidemic Model Of COVID-19 And Its Application To Ukrainian, Indonesian, And The Global Data",2020,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed serious threats to global public health and economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we first verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor and that its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased &#945;-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site, than the HR1 sequence in S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then, we designed an HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the results presented here provide important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The S protein of coronaviruses mediates viral receptor binding and membrane fusion, thus being considered a critical target for antivirals. Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has evolved a high level of activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of SARS-CoV that emerged previously. The HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability than the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity. Also, importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.","Zhu, Yuanmei; Yu, Danwei; Yan, Hongxia; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",J. virol,,196
476779,A Case Report of Polymerase Chain Reaction-Confirmed COVID-19 in a Patient With Right Ventricular Thrombus and Bilateral Deep Vein Thrombosis,2020,"Complexities of virus genotypes and the stochastic contacts in human society create a big challenge for estimating the potential risks of exposure to a widely spreading virus such as COVID-19. To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020. The correlation experiment with the new cases in the next two weeks shows that the risk estimation model offers promise in assisting people to be more precise about their personal safety and control of daily routine and social interaction. It can inform business and municipal COVID-19 policy to accelerate recovery.","Sun, Ziheng; Di, Liping; Sprigg, William; Tong, Daniel; Casal, Mariana",Health Place,,196

We performed plasma proteomics on 80 COVID-19 patients and controls, grouped according to disease severity and cardiac involvement. Findings were validated in 305 independent COVID-19 patients and investigated in an animal model. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory proteins, markers of biological aging, strongly associate with disease severity and cardiac involvement even in age-matched cohorts. FSTL3, an indicator of Activin/TGFbeta signaling, was the most significantly upregulated protein associated with the heart failure biomarker, NTproBNP (beta = 0.4;p adj =4.6x10 - 7 ), while ADAMTS13, a vWF-cleaving protease whose loss-of-function causes microvascular thrombosis, was the most downregulated protein associated with myocardial injury (beta=-0.4;p adj =8x10 - 7 ). Mendelian randomization supported a causal role for ADAMTS13 in myocardial injury. These data provide important new insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 cardiovascular complications with therapeutic implications.","Roh, J.; Kitchen, R.; Guseh, J.

478659,Maintaining robust HIV and tuberculosis services in the COVID-19 era: A public health dilemma in Zimbabwe,2020,"Following the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to a global pandemic, concerns have arisen for the disease impact in at-risk populations, especially in immunocompromised hosts. On the other hand, clinical studies have clarified that the COVID-19 clinical burden is mostly due to over-inflammation and immune-mediated multiorgan injury. This has led to downsizing the role of immunosuppression as a determinant of outcome, and early reports confirm the hypothesis that patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 with respect to the general population. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 natural reservoirs, such as bats and mice, have evolved mechanisms of tolerance involving selection of genes optimizing viral clearance through interferon type I and III responses and also dampening inflammasome response and cytokine expression. Children exhibit resistance to COVID-19 severe manifestations, and age-related features in innate and adaptive response possibly explaining this difference are discussed. A competent recognition by the innate immune system and controlled pro-inflammatory signaling seem to be the pillars of an effective response and the premise for pathogen clearance in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunosuppression-if not associated with other elements of fragility-do not represent per se an obstacle to this competent/tolerant phenotype in children. Several reports confirm that children receiving immunosuppressive medications have similar clinical involvement and outcomes as the pediatric general population, indicating that maintenance treatments should not be interrupted in suspect or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nicastro, E.; Verdoni, L.; Bettini, L.

METHODS: This study adopted a convenient sampling method and examined the psychological status of 150 front-line medical workers from Zhejiang Province with questionnaire surveys using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The participants had severe anxiety and depression; the top three items under the category of anxiety were genitourinary symptoms, behavior at interview, and respiratory symptoms, whereas the top three items under depression were feelings of guilt, weight loss, and retardation. Among all personal data, the following factors influenced anxiety, in decreasing order: degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms, degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected, and the affiliated hospital (p < .05). As for depression, the factors were the degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms and the degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that front-line medical staff presented symptoms of anxiety and depression when dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak and the factors influencing their psychological stress. Guiding policies and psychological interventions is crucial to maintaining their psychological well-being.

480810,COVID-19: Risk of Alcohol abuse and Psychiatric disorders,2020,"Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: A COVID-19-járvány az egész világon elterjedt. A járvány Európában való elso megjelenése során megfigyelheto volt, hogy a terjedés mértéke kisebb azokban az országokban, ahol a tuberkulózis elleni védekezésül kiterjedt BCG-vakcinációt végeznek. Célkituzés: A jelen munkában olyan összefüggéseket igyekeztünk feltárni, amelyek befolyásolták a járványterjedés paramétereit, különös figyelemmel a BCG-vakcinációs gyakorlatra. Módszerek: A világ összes olyan országára vonatkozóan, ahol megfelelo minoségu statisztikai adatok álltak rendelkezésünkre, vizsgáltuk a járvány terjedésének elso hullámát. A mozgóátlagolt járványgörbéken elemeztük a járvány idotartamát, a tetozés mértékét, a fertozöttek és a halálesetek egymillió lakosra vetített számát. Figyelembe vettük az országok gazdasági mutatóit (GDP, légi forgalom, a tengeri hajózás mértéke). Statisztikai analízis: A vizsgált paraméterek nem mutattak normális eloszlást, így nemparaméteres próbákkal (rangkorreláció, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) statisztikai kapcsolatot kerestünk a járványterjedés mértéke, a BCG-vakcináció és más paraméterek között. Eredmények: A járvány gyorsan elterjedt a világon, de mégis, február elso három hetében a terjedésben egy szünet volt megfigyelheto. A járványhullám Európában nagyjából egyszerre ért véget. A járvány által leginkább azok az országok érintettek, ahol nem alkalmaztak rendszeres BCG-vakcinációt, bár a képet bonyolítja, hogy ezek az országok gazdaságilag többnyire fejlettek. A halálozási rátában nem mutatkozott ilyen különbség. Következtetés: Statisztikailag igazolható tény, hogy a vakcinációt végzo országokból az elso hullám alatt kevesebb fertozöttet jelentettek; az ok-okozati összefüggés bizonytalan, hiszen az országok múltja, szokásai, társadalmi berendezkedése, gazdasági fejlettsége nem azonos. Eredményeink alátámasztják az összehasonlító kontaktkutatás fontosságát annak tisztázására, hogy a BCG-oltás hogyan befolyásolja az emberek vírussal szembeni érzékenységét, valamint a vírus terjesztésének, továbbadásának képességét. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(4): 123-134. INTRODUCTION: The new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic is widespread throughout the world. During the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe it was revealed that the rate of spread was lower in countries where extensive BCG vaccination is used to protect against tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: In the present work, we sought to explore relationships that influenced epidemic spreading parameters, with particular reference to BCG vaccination practice. METHODS: We examined the first wave of the spread of the epidemic for all countries in the world where adequate quality statistics were available. We analyzed the duration of the epidemic, the extent of the peak, the number of infected people, and the number of deaths per million inhabitants with the moving average of epidemic curves. We took into account the economic indicators of the countries (GDP, air traffic and extent of maritime shipping). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The examined parameters did not show a normal distribution, so we looked for a statistical relationship with non-parametric tests (rank correlation, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) between the extents of epidemic spread, BCG vaccination and other parameters. RESULTS: The epidemic spread rapidly around the world, but still, in the first three weeks of February, there was a pause in the spread. The first wave of epidemics ended roughly at the same time in Europe. Those countries are the most affected by the epidemic where regular BCG vaccination has not been used, although the picture is complicated by the fact that these countries are mostly economically developed. There was no such difference observable in the mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Although this work clearly demonstrates that during the first wave of the pandemic, fewer infections were reported worldwide in countries where BCG vaccination is obligatory, however, the causal relationship is uncertain, as the countries' past, customs, social organization and economic development are different. Our results support the necessity of comparative contact tracing to clarify how BCG vaccination affects people's susceptibility to this new type of coronavirus as well as their ability to spread and transmit the virus.

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to assess various dental professionals from both governmental and private sectors through online and social media outlets. RESULTS: A total of 1,033 questionnaires were collected (273 dental students, 193 dental auxiliary personnel, 544 dentists). In all, 63.4% of the respondents worked in hospitals. Of all the respondents, 44.9%, 33.4%, and 21.7% worked in governmental clinics, academia, and the private sector, respectively. Overall knowledge of the incubation period and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was consistent across all dental professions. Knowledge of hand-soap cleaning time was significantly different among dental professionals (p < 0.001). Dental professionals displayed significant disagreement on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the host (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 75.1% of the respondents were reluctant to treat a suspected COVID-19 patient, and 92% of the participants believed that the mode of transmission was droplet inhalation. Fever, coughing, and shortness of breath were identified as the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Most standard methods of prevention in the dental office were selected by at least 50% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Dental professionals seem to be consistent regarding their knowledge of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. However, knowledge of viral survivability and recommended hand-soap washing time was significantly variable among the professionals. A high degree of apprehension toward suspected COVID-19 patients existed among all dental professionals. Pandemic-awareness campaigns are essential among healthcare providers.","Shahin, Suliman Y; Bugshan, Amr S; Almulhim, Khalid S; AlSharief, Mishali S; Al-Dulaijan, Yousif A; Siddiqui, Intisar; Al-Qarni, Faisal D",BMC Oral Health,,196
484089,The prevalence and clinical significance of Presymptomatic COVID-19 patients: how we can be one step ahead in mitigating a deadly pandemic,2021,"Many enveloped viruses induce multinucleated cells (syncytia), reflective of membrane fusion events caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. These syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen ~6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with quantitative cell biology approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for biophysical aspects of the membrane, particularly cholesterol-rich regions, in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our findings potentially provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking statins and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2 and other fusogenic viruses.","Sanders, David W; Jumper, Chanelle C; Ackerman, Paul J; Bracha, Dan; Donlic, Anita; Kim, Hahn; Kenney, Devin; Castello-Serrano, Ivan; Suzuki, Saori; Tamura, Tomokazu; Tavares, Alexander H; Saeed, Mohsan; Holehouse, Alex S; Ploss, Alexander; Levental, Ilya; Douam, Florian; Padera, Robert F; Levy, Bruce D; Brangwynne, Clifford P",eLife (Cambridge),,196

While care is often thought of in terms of proximity, literature on 'landscapes of care' highlights the potential for 'care at a distance'. We extend this literature to examine practices of social distancing, specifically the act of maintaining a 'space between' bodies in communal areas - a practice currently brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the CF clinic as a case study, we examine how distancing can be understood as an emplaced practice of care, shaped by - and shaping - architectures and materialities in particular contexts. We explore these issues drawing on data from Pathways, practices and architectures: containing antimicrobial resistance in the cystic fibrosis clinic, a UK AHRC funded study (AH/R002037/1) examining practices in three cystic fibrosis clinics using visual and ethnographic methods. Clinical staff practices of maintaining distancing were often regarded by patients as 'care-ful', part of personalised 'care in place', embroiling a wider care assemblage including ancillary staff, materialities and architectures. Patients also actively participate in distancing as an 'ethic of care', using strategies of 'holding back' and 'looking out' in confined spaces. Yet our findings also highlight tensions between care, proximity and distance in circulation spaces and communal areas, including transient spaces where the assemblage of care breaks down. The article concludes by considering wider implications for healthcare design and for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buse, Christina; Brown, Nik; Nettleton, Sarah; Martin, Daryl; Lewis, Alan",Soc Sci Med,,196

Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques.

491794,The First Reported Case of COVID-19 Myocarditis Managed with Biventricular Impella Support,2021,"The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there was an upsurge of reports of chilblain like lesions (CLL) especially in young patients possibly implicated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Twelve clinically suspected and histopathologically confirmed cases of IP seen from November 2019 through February 2020 were retrospectively recruited. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological characteristics of these were reviewed and compared with CLL reported in the literature. Mean age of patients was 26.58 ± 15.18 years with an equal male to female ratio. Characteristic histopathology findings were spongiosis (100%), dermal edema (100%), perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (100%) with peri-eccrine accentuation (66.7%), keratinocyte necrosis (50%), focal basal vacuolar damage (58.3%), and lymphocytic vasculitis (58.3%). Significant dermoscopy findings were variable background color ranging from dull red and violaceous to copper red and brown orange, coiled vessels (44.4%) and orange-red structureless areas (63.9%). Lesions over palms and soles preferentially had white dots/clods and lines (38.9%). There appears no exclusive histopathological as well as dermoscopy features of CLL and IP, yet certain clues can be appreciated. Keratinocyte necrosis and severe dermal edema favors IP, whereas fibrin thrombi with involvement of both superficial and deep dermal vessels favor CLL. Dermoscopically presence of irregular, linear or branching vessels, red/purple dots and clods and gray brown reticule supports CLL while white dots/clods and lines supports IP.","Jindal, Rashmi; Chauhan, Payal; Goyal, Dikshita; Shirazi, Nadia",Dermatol Ther,,196

In this paper, we propose a novel method, Multi Vertical Federated Learning (Multi-VFL), to train VFL models when there are multiple data and label owners. Our approach is the first to consider the setting where $D$-data owners (across which features are distributed) and $K$-label owners (across which labels are distributed) exist. This proposed configuration allows different entities to train and learn optimal models without having to share their data. Our framework makes use of split learning and adaptive federated optimizers to solve this problem. For empirical evaluation, we run experiments on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.

496688,"Sociodemographic determinants and clinical risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity: a cross-sectional analysis of over 200,000 patients in Tehran, Iran",2021,"A model to predict the relative levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of coronaviruses (CoVs) by measuring the percentage of protein intrinsic disorder (PID) of the M (Membrane) and N (Nucleoprotein) proteins in their outer and inner shells, respectively, was built before the MERS-CoV outbreak. With MPID = 8.6% and NPID = 50.2%, the 2003 SARS-CoV falls into group B, which consists of CoVs with intermediate levels of both fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials. Further validation of the model came with MERS-CoV (MPID = 9%, NPID = 44%) and SARS-CoV-2 (MPID = 5.5%, NPID = 48%) falling into the groups C and B, respectively. Group C contains CoVs with higher fecal-oral but lower respiratory transmission potentials. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 with MPID = 5.5% has one of the hardest outer shells among CoVs. Because the hard shell is able to resist the antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids, the infected person is able to shed large quantities of viral particles via saliva and mucus, which could account for the higher contagiousness of SARS-COV-2. Further searches have found that high rigidity of the outer shell is characteristic for the CoVs of burrowing animals, such as rabbits (MPID = 5.6%) and pangolins (MPID = 5-6%), which are in contact with the buried feces. A closer inspection of pangolin-CoVs from 2017 to 2019 reveals that pangolins provided a unique window of opportunity for the entry of an attenuated SARS-CoV-2 precursor into the human population in 2017 or earlier, with the subsequent slow and silent spread as a mild cold that followed by its mutations into the current more virulent form. Evidence of this lies in both the genetic proximity of the pangolin-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 (â¼90%) and differences in N disorder. A 2017 pangolin-CoV strain shows evidence of higher levels of attenuation and higher fecal-oral transmission associated with lower human infectivity via having lower NPID (44.8%).

A systematic review and critical appraisal of published risk models,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled countries to impose lockdowns to curb the spread. As a result of the lockdown and need for health care services to cater to acute diseases on priority, patients with chronic illnesses such as Parkinson's disease (PD) may be facing several difficulties. Aims: This study aimed to explore the effects of prolongation of lockdown on patients with PD by evaluating possible problems faced during a lockdown and worsening of symptoms if any. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients with PD and their caregivers were contacted. Results: We observed a significant increase in problems faced due to this pandemic, specifically, the inability to access health care, and difficulty procuring medication. Patients also reported worsening of motor symptoms. Conclusions: The present findings highlight the need for health care systems to consider a plan of action for chronic neurological diseases like PD, which are worsening in the absence of regular hospital visits.","Prasad, Shweta; Holla, Vikram Venkappayya; Neeraja, Koti; Surisetti, Bharath Kumar; Kamble, Nitish; Yadav, Ravi; Pal, Pramod Kumar",Neurol India,,196
501660,"Correlation analysis of coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia: a single-center, retrospective, observational study",2020,"The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has seriously threatened global health security, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the burden of the disease worldwide, still, no licensed vaccine or any specific drug against 2019-nCoV is available. Data from several countries show that few repurposed drugs using existing antiviral drugs have not (so far) been satisfactory and more recently were proven to be even highly toxic. These findings underline an urgent need for preventative and therapeutic interventions designed to target specific aspects of 2019-nCoV. Again the major factor in this urgency is that the process of data acquisition by physical experiment is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Scientific simulations and more in-depth data analysis permit to validate or refute drug repurposing opportunities predicted via target similarity profiling to speed up the development of a new more effective anti-2019-nCoV therapy especially where in vitro and/or in vivo data are not yet available. In addition, several research programs are being developed, aiming at the exploration of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV. Computational-based technology has given us the tools to explore and identify potentially effective drug and/or vaccine candidates which can effectively shorten the time and reduce the operating cost. The aim of the present review is to address the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules and define the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for SARS-CoV-2.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Osali, Abdolreza; Valizadeh, Hamed; Roshangar, Leila; Ahmadi, Majid",J Cell Physiol,,196

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients (mean age, 61 years; 43 males and 30 females) who underwent single-level partial hemilaminectomy of the lumbar spine without postoperative complications or other level spinal abnormalities between January 2010 and December 2018 were enrolled. Two musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated transiting nerve rootlet abnormalities (thickening, signal alteration, distinction, and displacement), epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis on MRI obtained one year after the operations. A spine surgeon blinded to the radiologic findings evaluated each patient for PPP. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between the MRI findings and PPP. RESULTS: The presence of transiting nerve rootlet thickening, signal alteration, and ill-distinction was significantly different between the patients with PPP and those without, for both readers (p &#8804; 0.020). Conversely, the presence of transiting nerve rootlet displacement, epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis was not significantly different between the two groups (p &#8805; 0.128). Among the above radiologic findings, transiting nerve rootlet thickening and signal alteration were the most significant findings in the multivariate analyses (p &#8804; 0.009). CONCLUSION: On MRI, PPP was associated with transiting nerve rootlet abnormalities, including thickening, signal alterations, and ill-distinction, but was not associated with epidural fibrosis or intrathecal arachnoiditis. The most relevant findings were the nerve rootlet thickening and signal alteration.","Park, Chankue; Lee, In Sook; Nam, Kyoung Hyup; Song, You Seon; Lee, Tae Hong; Han, In Ho; Kim, Dong Hwan",Korean j. radiol,,196

We comprehensively reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar for available evidence regarding COVID-19 various ocular manifestations, with special focus on less known and unusual ocular findings. We then categorized the findings based on the parts of the eye which was involved. In anterior sections of the eye, the involvement of the eyelid (tarsadenitis), conjunctiva and cornea (follicular conjunctivitis, pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, and keratoconjunctivitis), episclera (nodular episcleritis), uvea (anterior uveitis) were reported. Also, third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy, retinal vasculitis, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) changes (hyper-reflective lesions and increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness [RNFLT]), optic neuritis, papillophlebitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (PRES), ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery occlusion, and polyneuritis cranialis were reported in different studies. Postmortem evaluation of COVID-19 patients detected no viral RNA in different anterior and posterior segments of the eyes. However, another study revealed a 21.4% positivity of the retinal biopsies of dead patients. The results of this study can help ophthalmologists to be vigilant when they see these findings in a suspected case of COVID-19.

These virtual components will likely be incorporated into future iterations of these conferences even as in-person attendance is reincorporated. In this review, we discuss ways in which usage of the social networking platform Twitter has expanded in the past year during virtual conferences as a method to facilitate-and, in some ways, democratize-information flow and professional networking. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging Twitter-based tools in malignant hematology include presenter-developed #tweetorials, conference-specific ""poster walks,"" and disease-specific online journal clubs. Twitter is also increasingly being used for networking across institutional and international lines, allowing for conversations to continue year-round as a first step toward multicenter collaborations as well as in-person #tweetups at subsequent meetings. The ability of Twitter to enable uninterrupted information exchange has reinforced its central role in medical and scientific communication in a way that will certainly outlive the COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Rahul; Kelkar, Amar H; Logan, Aaron C; Majhail, Navneet S; Pemmaraju, Naveen",Curr Hematol Malig Rep,,196

509937,Clinical outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases: a multicentric matched cohort study,2020,"Mutualistic symbiosis, in which individuals of different species cooperate and both benefit, has long been an evolutionary puzzle. Why should individuals of two different species cooperate? In this case, as in all others, cooperation is not automatic, but rather requires the mediation of evolutionary conflicts. In chemiosmosis, redox reactions produce a trans-membrane ""proton-motive force"" that powers energy-requiring reactions in most organisms. Chemiosmosis may also have a role in conflict mediation. Chemiosmosis rapidly produces considerable amounts of products, increasing the risk of end-product inhibition and the formation of dangerous by-products, such as reactive oxygen species. While several mechanisms can modulate chemiosmosis, potential negative effects can also be ameliorated by simply dispersing excess product into the environment. This ""free lunch you are forced to make"" can attract individuals of other species leading to groups, in which other organisms share the products that are released into the environment by the chemiosmotic cell or organism. Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biology has recognized that groups are the key to the evolution of cooperation. With many small groups, chance associations of cooperators can arise, even if cooperation is selected against at the individual level. Groups of cooperators can then outcompete groups of defectors, which do not cooperate. Indeed, numerous symbioses may have arisen in this way, perhaps most notably the symbioses of host cells and chemiosmotic bacteria that gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. Other examples in which one partner relies on chemiosmotic products supplied by the other include lichens, corals or other metazoans and dinoflagellates, sap-feeding insects, and plant-rhizobia and plant-mycorrhiza interactions. More problematic are cases of gut microbiomes-for instance, those of termites, ruminants, and even human beings. Under some but not all circumstances, chemiosmosis can be co-opted into punishing defectors and enforcing cooperation, thus leading to mutualistic symbioses.","Blackstone, Neil W",Results Probl Cell Differ,,196

However, at this point, it is difficult to determine whether telemedicine fulfills its role as a health care strategy. Arguably, if we had enough previous experience with telemedicine or sufficient preparation for its application, telemedicine could be more smoothly and flexibly adopted in the medical field. As it is still not possible to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, phone consultation and prescription are likely to continue for some time. Hence, it is expected that telemedicine will naturally settle in the medical field in the near future. However, as we have noticed during this outbreak, improvised telemedicine without adequate guidance can be confusing to both patients and health professionals, thus reducing the benefit to patients.

Although the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is predominantly centred on the respiratory system, some patients can develop an abnormal inflammatory reaction involving extrapulmonary tissues. The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion. Additional studies are required to learn about the mechanisms involved in the development of these manifestations and apply that knowledge to achieve early diagnosis and the most suitable therapy.","Ramos-Casals, Manuel; Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Mariette, Xavier",Nat Rev Rheumatol,,196

The participants completed the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED), Children's Negative Cognitive Errors Questionnaire (CNCEQ), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed that the Parent+ group recorded higher SCARED and CNCEQ scores and lower PedsQL scores in comparison with the control group. No statistically significant difference was found between the scores of the Child+ and control groups. Furthermore, high CNCEQ scores and low PedsQL scores in the Parent+ group predicted an increase in their SCARED scores.

519777,A rationale for targeting the P2X7 receptor in Coronavirus disease 19,2020,"Niclosamide (NIC) has demonstrated promising in vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though NIC is already FDA-approved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization.","Brunaugh, A.

We evaluated construct rating variability between the organizations to determine barriers and facilitators. The strongest facilitator determined was stakeholder's awareness of the parent's and student's needs to meet the HPV school-entry requirement. Other facilitators included initiatives for school-entry policies and the relative advantage of this requirement over different strategies. The strongest barriers included was the cost for private providers to administer the HPV vaccine, the negative influence of social media about the vaccine, which affected parents' acceptance, and the lack of school nurses as available staff resources for the school entry requirement. Findings from this study can be used to improve implementation (adaptations/modifications) and inform other states and countries in earlier stages of consideration of the adoption of similar immunization policies. Most barriers can be modifiable with the implementation of educational programs/training across schools, considering that they are the first line of response to parents of this school entry requirement.","Colón-López, Vivian; Soto-Abreu, Roxana; Medina-Laabes, Diana T; Díaz-Miranda, Olga L; Ortiz, Ana P; Suárez, Erick L; Hull, Pamela C",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,196

Prior to COVID-19, numerous barriers limited broad uptake of buprenorphine among people who use drugs at the system, provider, and patient levels, including lack of available DATA 2000 waivered clinicians to prescribe, stigma, and competing livelihood priorities. As two harm reduction primary care programs in New York State that care for people who use drugs and offer buprenorphine, one rural (Ithaca) and one urban (Manhattan), we have rapidly adopted telemedicine to initiate buprenorphine treatment. Our collective experience suggests that telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation is eliminating many traditional barriers to treatment, in particular for individuals leaving incarceration, and people who use drugs and access syringe service programs. Future models of buprenorphine treatment should incorporate telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation, which can be done in collaboration with community-based outreach and peer networks to engage people who use drugs. This regulatory change must be sustained beyond COVID-19, and is vital to increasing access to buprenorphine, closing the opioid use disorder treatment gap, and achieving greater health equity for people who use drugs.","Wang, Linda; Weiss, Jeffrey; Ryan, Elizabeth Bogel; Waldman, Justine; Rubin, Stacey; Griffin, Judy L",J Subst Abuse Treat,,196

However, evidence supporting the effectiveness and benefits of this strategy in SpA is scarce. In this review we discuss the three types of MD care models: (i) combined clinics (MD units), including ‘face to face’, ‘parallel’ and ‘circuit approach’ clinics; (ii) MD team meetings; (iii) group consultations. The most frequently used model in SpA studies has been the ‘parallel’ combined clinic and usually encompasses a rheumatologist and another specialist, most commonly a dermatologist or a gastroenterologist, that work in tandem according to predefined referral criteria and treatment algorithms. MD working seems to improve the care of patients with SpA by a better identification and diagnosis of the disease, an earlier and more comprehensive treatment approach, and better outcomes for patients in terms of disease activity, physical function, quality of life and patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, challenges remain. Data on effectiveness and feasibility are scarce and are mostly derived from studies with design issues and often without a unidisciplinary care comparator arm. Although patient centricity is one of the core values of patient care and MD setting in SpA, the patient often does not play an active role in most of the MD settings studied or in common clinical practice. Further efforts should be made so that MD care reflects patients’ expectations and needs. Overcoming these limits will help to implement successfully SpA MD care in daily clinical practice and subsequently to achieve a higher quality of care for our patients.","Gudu, Tania; Jadon, Deepak R.",Ther Adv Musculoskelet Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354231/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1759720x20975888,196

The aim of this study was to examine how personality traits were associated with adjustment to the COVID pandemic in college students. The sample included 484 first-year university students (76% female) attending a northeastern university who completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality assessment at the beginning of a semester that was disrupted by the COVID pandemic. Using a phone-based app, students completed daily ratings of mood, perceived stress levels, and engagement in a number of health promotion activities (exercise, mindfulness, adequate sleep, etc.) throughout the semester both before and after the onset of the pandemic (e.g., a within-person longitudinal design). Results, as expected, showed that mood and wellness indices generally declined during the COVID period, although stress levels actually decreased. Further, irrespective of COVID, improved mood, less perceived stress and greater participation in health promotion activities were significantly associated with a number of personality traits including neuroticism (lower), extraversion (higher), agreeableness (higher), and conscientiousness (higher). Of primary interest, mixed-effects models were used to test how major personality traits interacted with any changes in daily ratings from the pre-COVID to COVID period. Significant interactions terms were found suggesting differential impacts of the COVID epidemic for students with low versus high levels of particular traits. Higher levels of extraversion, for example, were found to be related to decreases in mood as the pandemic progressed in contrast to those with lower extraversion, for whom there was a slight increase in mood over time. These data support the conclusion that personality traits are related to mental health and can play a role in a person’s ability to cope with major stressful events. Different traits may also be more adaptive to different types of stressors.","Rettew, David C.; McGinnis, Ellen W.; Copeland, William; Nardone, Hilary Y.; Bai, Yang; Rettew, Jeff; Devadenam, Vinay; Hudziak, James J.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730075/,196

Objectives The question of the role of these tests during periods of low circulation of the virus has been legitimately raised. Study design We addressed this question by analyzing the results of more than 16,000 SARS-CoV-2 PCRs during the first half of 2020 in a French region heavily affected by COVID-19. We were thus able to calculate and extrapolate the theoretical sensitivity of the antigenic tests for various periods during and after the first epidemic wave. Results As the PCR-positivity rate of nasopharyngeal swabs declined over time, the proportion of samples with low Ct levels also decreased. Thus, the calculation of the analytical sensitivity of the antigenic tests ranged from 70 to 80% when the percentage of PCR positivity was > 1%, but fell below this score when it was lower. Conclusions The performance and relevance of antigenic tests appears to be more limited during phases of low circulation of the virus. This may have a negative impact on the effectiveness of isolation, testing, and contact tracing strategies.","Brochot, Etienne",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667038021000016?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667038021000016,196

RECENT FINDINGS: Inflammatory cardiomyopathies are increasingly recognized as the etiology of both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. There have been recent studies providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of arrhythmias in inflammatory cardiomyopathies and exploring the role of various diagnostic tools and treatment strategies. SUMMARY: Patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathies often present with one or more arrhythmias, including atrioventricular block, atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and occasionally sudden cardiac death. Given dynamic pathophysiology and heterogeneous presentation, the management of arrhythmias in these patients presents unique challenges. We review the current approach to the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias in this challenging cohort of patients with an emphasis on cardiac sarcoidosis.

The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib is one of the approved treatments for symptomatic Waldenström macroglobulinemia. However, some controversy exists regarding the use of ibrutinib in these patients with high risk of bleeding because of its antiaggregant effect that could increase the risk of bleeding. Here, we present the case of a patient with Waldenström macroglobulinemia with associated acquired von Willebrand syndrome and progressively significant bleeding symptoms, who experienced a rapid increase in von Willebrand factor with ibrutinib treatment, despite only reaching a partial response in IgM levels similar to those reached with other previous treatments. We suggest that the control over the monoclonal protein is not the only mechanism that explains the good response, improvement in the bleeding symptoms and von Willebrand factor levels. This fact could be explained by the reduced glycoprotein Ib receptor expression induced by ibrutinib and the consequent von Willebrand factor increase in peripheral blood.","Poza, María; Íñiguez, Rodrigo; Zamanillo, Irene; Redondo, Sara; Alonso, Rafael; Martínez-López, Joaquín; Jiménez-Ubieto, Ana",Ther Adv Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1177/20406207211039326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471509/,196

In this context, it is important to shed light on the gaps in the epidemiological characteristics and the geographic range for many AFI aetiologies. OBJECTIVES: To review studies on community-acquired fever aetiology other than malaria in Latin America, and to highlight knowledge gaps and challenges needing further investigation. SOURCES: PubMed from 2012 to April 2018. CONTENT: We found 17 eligible studies describing 13 539 patients. The median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5 (range 2–17). A causative pathogen could be determined for 6661 (49.2%) individuals. The most frequently reported pathogen during the study periods was dengue virus (DENV) (14 studies), followed by chikungunya virus (nine studies) and Zika virus (seven studies). Among the studies reporting concurrent infections, 296 individuals (2.2%) were found to have co-infections. In-hospital mortality was reported in eight (47%) studies, ranging between 0% and 18%. IMPLICATIONS: DENV fever is the febrile illness most frequently reported, reflecting its importance, while chikungunya and zika viruses present increasing trends since their emergence in the region. Studies with systematic and harmonized approaches for detection of multiple pathogens are needed and would probably reveal a higher burden of neglected pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. and arenaviruses. The lack of point-of-care tests and harmonized approach limits the care provided by health professionals and the efficacy of surveillance for AFI in the region.","Moreira, J.; Bressan, C.S.; Brasil, P.; Siqueira, A.M.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18304014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18304014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777926/,196

Purpose: This study was designed to evaluate a patient safety education program among hospitalized patients. Of the 69 participants, 33 completed the patient safety education program while the 36 remaining participants were given educational booklets. The program was used to measure knowledge about patient safety, patient safety perception, and willingness to participate in patient safety. Methods: Patient safety education was developed by the analysis–design–development–implementation–evaluation model considering expert advice, patient needs, and an extensive literature review. Data were collected from 20 July to 13 November 2020. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical program. The effectiveness of the experimental and control groups before and after education was analyzed using paired t-tests, and the difference in the amount of increase in the measured variables for each group was analyzed using independent t-tests. Results: The experimental group had significantly higher patient safety scores (t = 2.52, p = 0.014) and patient safety perception (t = 2.09, p = 0.040) than those of the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the willingness to participate in patient safety. Conclusion: The patient safety education program developed using mobile tablet PCs could be an effective tool to enhance patient involvement in preventing events that may threaten the safety of patients. Further studies are recommended to develop a variety of educational interventions to increase patient safety knowledge and perceptions of patients and caregivers.","Shin, Sun Hwa; Kim, Mi Jung; Moon, Ho Jin; Lee, Eun Hye",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809882/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063262,196

Microorganisms from different ecological conditions and engineered microbes capable to produce versatile enzymes and bioproducts are added to native microbial population for in situ treatment of wastewater. Bacterial pathogen borne in wastewater is an important concern for public health because they are not only associated with environmental damage, morbidity, and mortality but also cause economic loss connected with physical and chemical methods in wastewater treatment. Bacteriophages are natural killer of bacteria; they can be used as an alternative, cost-effective, biological method for waterborne bacterial pathogen control. Legionella pneumophila is the most tracked waterborne pathogen requiring specific treatment conditions because despite of biocides use, they are able to persist in water supplies with the help of multispecies biofilms and phagocytic protists. This type of pathogens can be biologically controlled through native complex communities fight for nutrients by means of antagonistic molecules as war weapons.

Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. Regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the DRG microenvironment influences the different regenerative capacities after injury to peripheral or central axons remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptional profiling of mouse DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central axon injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to the three types of injuries. All injuries increased the proportion of a cell type that shares features of both immune cells and glial cells. A distinct subset of satellite glial cells (SGC) appeared specifically in response to peripheral nerve injury. Activation of the PPARα signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury, failed to occur after central axon injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPARα agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single-cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.","Avraham, Oshri; Feng, Rui; Ewan, Eric Edward; Rustenhoven, Justin; Zhao, Guoyan; Cavalli, Valeria",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.68457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586065/,196

Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. Verdict Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months.When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted.","Aucoin, Monique; Cooley, Kieran; Saunders, Paul Richard; Carè, Jenny; Anheyer, Dennis; Medina, Daen N.; Cardozo, Valentina; Remy, Daniella; Hannan, Nicole; Garber, Anna",Adv Integr Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212958820301373?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aimed.2020.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212958820301373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837894/,196

The bivariate logistic regression test was used to analyse the predictors associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: CPs were more susceptible to acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than the general public (12.9% vs. 1.5%). The significant predictors of infection included a family member with confirmed COVID-19 infection, age <40 years, encountering patients in pharmacy without a protective glass-barrier, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or colleagues with confirmed COVID-19 during practice. Additionally, the mean level of the respondents’ expected rate of infection was 3.27 ± 1.04 (out of 5). This level was significantly higher among female pharmacists and Lebanese pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CPs are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 compared with the general public. This is attributed to several occupational factors that increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Therefore, healthcare authorities are advised to enforce strict occupational guidelines for CPs.","Khojah, Hani M.J.; Itani, Rania; Mukattash, Tareq L.; Karout, Samar; Jaffal, Fatima; Abu-Farha, Rana",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361221001347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305508/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361221001347; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.06.007,196

Their structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR as well as LC/MS. The cytotoxicity of these novel isatins against human leukemia K562 cells were evaluated by MTT assay in vitro. SAR studies indicated that the N-substituted benzyl and C-5 substituted phenyl groups greatly enhance their cytotoxic activity, whereas an intact carbonyl functionality on C-3 present in the parent ring is required to maintain such a potency. Particularly, N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(p-methoxyphenyl)isatin (compound 2m) showed the highest antitumor activity against K562 cell lines (IC(50) = 0.03 μM). Moreover, treatment with compound 2m significantly inhibited liver cancer HepG2 cells proliferation and migration, which could also reduce the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) tube formation. In conclusion, compound 2m exhibited very good cancer cells proliferation inhibition by angiogenesis responses in vitro, and 2m might be a promising angiogenesis inhibitor for cancer treatment.","Zhang, Qian; Teng, Yuou; Yuan, Yuan; Ruan, Tingting; Wang, Qi; Gao, Xing; Zhou, Yao; Han, Kailin; Yu, Peng; Lu, Kui",Eur J Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30055465/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523418305889; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523418305889; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.032,196

An online survey for children aged 7–12 years of age and parent/caregivers from the UK, Sweden, Brazil, Spain, Canada and Australia was conducted between 6(th) of April and the 1(st) of June 2020. The surveys included demographic questions and both closed and open questions focussing on access to and understanding of COVID-19 information. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis procedures were conducted. The findings show that parents are the main source of information for children during the pandemic in most countries (89%, n = 347), except in Sweden where school was the main source of information. However, in many cases parents chose to shield, filter or adapt their child’s access to information about COVID-19, especially in relation to the death rates within each country. Despite this, children in this study reported knowing that COVID-19 was deadly and spreads quickly. This paper argues for a community rather than individual approach to addressing children’s health literacy needs during a pandemic.","Bray, Lucy; Carter, Bernie; Blake, Lucy; Saron, Holly; Kirton, Jennifer A.; Robichaud, Fanny; Avila, Marla; Ford, Karen; Nafria, Begonya; Forsner, Maria; Nilsson, Stefan; Chelkowski, Andrea; Middleton, Andrea; Rullander, Anna-Clara; Mattsson, Janet; Protheroe, Joanne",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566813/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246405,196

Three scenes from small group CVA discussions were selected for analysis from 14 CVA discussions where 8–12 learners interacted via the annotation tool on top of a video. The twenty-second scenes were analyzed for semiotic meaning-making practices and this revealed a variety of participatory media literacy levels among these undergraduates. Topics of discussions were related but not identical, and the selected exemplars showed a range of attention to communicative features of the media. Discussions evolved in dramatically different ways due to the interplay of images, text, and learner choices.

In simple SIR models the number of infections grows at the outbreak as $I(t) \propto t^{d-1}$ on $d$-dimensional Euclidean lattices in the endemic phase or follow a slower universal PL at the critical point, until finite sizes cause immunity and a crossover to an exponential decay. Heterogeneity may alter the dynamics of spreading models, spatially inhomogeneous infection rates can cause slower decays, posing a threat of a long recovery from a pandemic. COVID-19 statistics have also provided epidemic size distributions with PL tails in several countries. Here I investigate SIR like models on hierarchical modular networks, embedded in 2d lattices with the addition of long-range links. I show that if the topological dimension of the network is finite, average degree dependent PL growth of prevalence emerges. Supercritically the same exponents as of regular graphs occurs, but the topological disorder alters the critical behavior. This is also true for the epidemic size distributions. Mobility of individuals does not affect the form of the scaling behavior, except for the $d=2$ lattice, but increases the magnitude of the epidemic. The addition of a super-spreader hot-spot also does not change the growth exponent and the exponential decay in the herd immunity regime.","'Odor, G'eza",Physical review.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of staff is already identified as an area of high risk; therefore, providing timely access to psychological support may be vital, although limited evidence is available on how these risks are best managed. AIMS: To describe implementation and analysis of a psychology-led COVID-19 telephone support line in a National Health Service OHS. METHODS: Data from calls made to the support line were collected over the first 4 weeks of service implementation. Numerical data including frequency of calls and average waiting time were first considered. A content analysis was then conducted on call notes to identify prevalence of themes. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty-five calls were received, and 362 notes included sufficient information for use within the content analysis. Frequency of calls peaked within the first week followed by a reduction in the number of calls received per day over time. Most calls included discussion around clarification of guidance (68%) with a smaller subset of calls offering support around anxiety (29%). Prevalence of themes did not appear to change over time. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and timely information is vital to support the well-being of healthcare staff. A psychologically informed telephone support line was a good use of occupational health service resources in the interim while more tailored advice and services could be established.","Matthewson, J; Tiplady, A; Gerakios, F; Foley, A; Murphy, E",Occup Med (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449754/,196

We show that when case fatalities and transmission rates are represented by simple Sigmoid functions, historical cases and fatalities can be fit with a relative-root-mean-squared-error accuracy on the order of 2% for most American states over the period from initial cases to July 20 (2020). We find that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in disease progression across regions.","Lyu, M.; Hall, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201905v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201905,196

METHODS: We enrolled all passengers and crew suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, who bounded for Beijing on international flights. We specified the characteristics of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and utilised Wells-Riley equation to estimate the infectivity of COVID-19 during air travel. RESULTS: We screened 4492 passengers and crew with suspected COVID-19 infection, verified 161 confirmed cases (mean age 28.6 years), and traced two confirmed cases who may have been infected in the aircraft. The estimated infectivity was 375 quanta/h (range 274–476), while the effective infectivity was only 4 quanta/h (range 2–5). The risk of per-person infection during a 13 h air travel in economy class was 0.56‰ (95% CI 0.41‰–0.72‰). CONCLUSION: We found that the universal use of face masks on the flight, together with the plane's ventilation system, significantly decreased the infectivity of COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the lifestyle in the world, especially air travel which has the potential to spread SARS-CoV-2. The universal use of face masks on the flight, together with the plane's ventilation system, significantly decreased the infectivity of COVID-19 on an aircraft.

In the first part, several liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) methods were compared to each other in order to observe their extraction ability for the analyte. VA-SFDF-LPME method was selected as an efficient and easy extraction method due to its higher extraction efficiency. Optimization studies were carried out for the parameters such as extraction solvent type, sodium hydroxide volume/concentration, sample volume, spraying number and mixing type/period. Tukey's method based on post hoc test was applied to all experimental data for the selection of optimum values. Optimum extraction parameters were found to be 12 mL initial sample volume, two sprays of dichloromethane, 0.75 mL of 60 g/kg sodium hydroxide and 15 s vortex. Under the optimum conditions, limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) were calculated as 2.8 and 9.2 μg/kg, respectively. Detection power of the GC–MS system was increased by approximately 317 folds with the developed extraction/preconcentration method.

Although the prognosis of CNS infections is often favorable, mortality and long-term sequelae can occur. The aims of this narrative review were to describe the specific microbiological and clinical features of the most frequent pathogens and to provide an update on the diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies for viral CNS infections in children. A literature analysis showed that the most common pathogens worldwide are enteroviruses, arboviruses, parechoviruses, and herpesviruses, with variable prevalence rates in different countries. Lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed as soon as possible when CNS infection is suspected, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples should always be sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Due to the lack of specific therapies, the management of viral CNS infections is mainly based on supportive care, and empiric treatment against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection should be started as soon as possible. Some researchers have questioned the role of acyclovir as an empiric antiviral in older children due to the low incidence of HSV infection in this population and observed that HSV encephalitis may be clinically recognizable beyond neonatal age. However, the real benefit-risk ratio of selective approaches is unclear, and further studies are needed to define appropriate indications for empiric acyclovir. Research is needed to find specific therapies for emerging pathogens. Moreover, the appropriate timing of monitoring neurological development, performing neuroimaging evaluations and investigating the effectiveness of rehabilitation during follow-up should be evaluated with long-term studies.","Autore, Giovanni; Bernardi, Luca; Perrone, Serafina; Esposito, Susanna",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572214/,196

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a vital role in viral infection and serves as a major target for developing neutralizing antibodies. In this study, the antibody response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was analyzed by a panel of sera from animals immunized with RBD-based antigens and four linear B-cell epitope peptides (R345, R405, R450 and R465) were revealed. The immunogenicity of three immunodominant peptides (R345, R405, R465) was further accessed by peptide immunization in mice, and all of them could induced potent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that the three determinants in the RBD were immunogenic. We further generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (15G9, 12C10 and 10D2) binding to these epitope peptides, and finely mapped the three immunodominant epitopes using the corresponding antibodies. Neutralization assays showed that all three monoclonal antibodies had neutralization activity. Results from IFA and western blotting showed that 12C10 was a cross-reactive antibody against both of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Results from conservative and structural analysis showed that (350)VYAWN(354) was a highly conserved epitope and exposed on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, whereas (473)YQAGSTP(479) located in the receptor binding motif (RBM) was variable among different SARS-CoV-2 strains. (407)VRQIAP(412) was a highly conserved, but cryptic epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. These findings provide important information for understanding the humoral antibody response to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and may facilitate further efforts to design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the target of COVID-19 diagnostic.","Jiang, Min; Zhang, Gaiping; Liu, Hongliang; Ding, Peiyang; Liu, Yunchao; Tian, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yanwei; Wang, Aiping",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.707977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621266/,196

Viral load, host innate-immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and comorbidities have a direct impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients and determine the diverse disease trajectories. The initial SARS-CoV-2 penetrance and replication in the host causes death of infected cells, determining the viral response. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the host triggers the activation of host antiviral immune mechanisms, determining the inflammatory response. While a healthy immune response is essential to eliminate infected cells and prevent spread of the virus, a dysfunctional immune response can result in a cytokine storm and hyperinflammation, contributing to disease progression. Current therapies for COVID-19 target the virus and/or the host immune system and may be complicated in their efficacy by comorbidities. Here we review the evidence for use of two classes of anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of COVID-19.

This paper examines the introduction, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19 into Pacific SIDS. Methods: Calculate the rate of transmission (the average number of new cases per day between the first recorded case and the most recent day) and connectivity (daily direct flights to the leading airport in each selected island group) using flight history and COVID-19 transmission data. Results: Correlational analyses show that connectivity is positively related with (a) first-case dates and (b) spread rate in Pacific SIDS. Conclusion: Connectivity plays a central role in the spread of COVID-19 in Pacific SIDS. The continued entry of people was a significant factor for spread within countries. Efforts to prevent transmission by closing borders reduced transmission but also created significant economic hardship because many Pacific SIDS rely heavily on tourism and international exchange. The findings highlight the importance of exploring the possibility that the COVID-19 spread rate may be higher than official figures indicate, and present pathways to mitigate socio-economic impacts. The practical implications of the findings reveal the vulnerability of Pacific SIDS to pandemics and the key role of connectivity in the spread of COVID-19 in the Pacific region.","Leal Filho, Walter; Lütz, Johannes M.; Sattler, David N.; Nunn, Patrick D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731327/,196

Peu de données existent concernant les plus de 75 ans, notamment lorsqu’ils ont des troubles cognitifs et du comportement. Objectif : Présenter les caractéristiques des symptômes observés dans deux populations de patients hospitalisés : les patients en unités protégées « Alzheimer » et les patients « standards » hospitalisés en unité dédiée Covid, et comparer les taux de mortalité. Matériel et méthode : Étude rétrospective incluant les patients de plus de 65 ans hospitalisés à Paul Brousse du 13 mars au 15 avril 2020 en unité Alzheimer et en unité Covid, et ayant une infection au Sars-CoV2 confirmée par RT-PCR ou sérologie.

Résultats : Cent soixante-dix-huit patients (87 ans [82 ; 91], 67% de femmes) ont été inclus dont 60 patients « Alzheimer » (86 ans [81 ; 88,25], 68% de femmes) et 118 patients « standards » (88 ans [83,25 ; 92], 66% de femmes). Le groupe standard était plus âgé et avait un score de Charlson plus élevé. Le taux de mortalité n’était pas significativement différent entre les 2 groupes (p = 0,09). Cliniquement, le groupe « standard » présentait une infection plus grave que le groupe « Alzheimer » : le score qSOFA et le débit d’oxygène maximum nécessaire étaient plus élevés. De même, biologiquement, le groupe « standard » présentait une lymphopénie non observée dans le groupe « Alzheimer ». En revanche, les patients du groupe « Alzheimer » consommaient significativement plus de neuroleptiques. Conclusion : Le taux de mortalité était le même chez les patients en unités Alzheimer et en unité Covid, avec cependant une tendance à y avoir plus de décès dans le groupe « standard » (27% vs 17%, p = 0,09).

Introduction: By July 1st, 2020, the SARS-CoV2 epidemic had affected more than 200 countries with more than 10 million identified cases and 508,000 deaths. Many older people have been infected, but little data exists for those aged over 75 years, especially for those presenting cognitive and behavioral problems. Objective: To describe the characteristics of the symptoms presented by two populations of hospitalized patients: patients hospitalized in an “Alzheimer's” protected unit and “standard” patients hospitalized in a dedicated COVID unit, and to compare the mortality rates. Materials and method: A retrospective study including patients over 65 years old hospitalized in Paul Brousse was conducted from March 13 to April 15, 2020 in an Alzheimer's unit and a COVID unit, with Sars-CoV2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or serology. Data was derived from medical records concerning the patient's background, long-term treatments, and clinical and laboratory data during the infection. Results: One hundred and seventy-eight patients (87 years [82 ; 91], 67% women) were included, including 60 “Alzheimer” patients (86 years [81 ; 88,25], 68% women) and 118 ""standard"" patients (88 years [83,25 ; 92], 66% female). The ""standard"" group was older and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index. The mortality rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (p = 0,09). Clinically, the ""standard"" group had a more serious infection than the ""Alzheimer's"" group: the qSOFA score and the maximum oxygen flow required were higher. Also, biologically, the “standard” group had more marked lymphopenia and eosinopenia. On the other hand, patients in the “Alzheimer” group were significantly more often receiving neuroleptics. Conclusion: The mortality rate was the same among patients in the Alzheimer's unit and in the Covid unit, with however a tendency to register more deaths in the “standard” group (27% vs 17%, p = 0.09).

There is an urgent need for a summary of neuroimaging findings to accelerate diagnosis and treatment plans. We reviewed prospective and retrospective studies to classify neurological abnormalities observed in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS The relevant studies published in Scopus, PubMed and Clarivate Analytics databases were analysed. The search was performed for full-text articles published from 23 January 2020 to 23 February 2021. RESULTS In 23 studies the number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 20,850 and the number of patients with neurological manifestations was 1996 (9.5%). The total number of patients with neuroradiological abnormalities was 602 (2.8%). SARS-CoV-2 has led to various neuroimaging abnormalities which can be categorised by neuroanatomical localisation of lesions and their main probable underlying pathogenesis. Cranial nerve and spinal root abnormalities were cranial neuritis and polyradiculitis. Parenchymal abnormalities fell into four groups of: (a) thrombosis disorders, namely ischaemic stroke and sinus venous thrombosis; (b) endothelial dysfunction and damage disorders manifested as various types of intracranial haemorrhage and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; (c) hypoxia/hypoperfusion disorders of leukoencephalopathy and watershed infarction; and (d) inflammatory disorders encompassing demyelinating disorders, encephalitis, vasculitis-like disorders, vasculopathy and cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum. Leptomeninges disorders included meningitis. Ischaemic stroke was the most frequent abnormality in these studies. CONCLUSION The review study suggests that an anatomical approach to the classification of heterogeneous neuroimaging findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and neurological manifestations would lend itself well for use by practitioners in diagnosis and treatment planning.","Bahranifard, Bahar; Mehdizadeh, Somayeh; Hamidi, Ali; Khosravi, Alireza; Emami, Ramin; Mirzaei, Kamran; Nemati, Reza; Nemati, Fatemeh; Assadi, Majid; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",The neuroradiology journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224248/; https://doi.org/10.1177/19714009211029177,196

Surprisingly enough we showed that, in these patients, the COVID was moderate and did not result in fatalities. The pathogenesis of the COVID is characterized by the profound dysregulation of the immune system. To explain our findings, we speculated that the immunosuppression due to the brain injury could be protective against the development of the COVID in patients with DOC. More recently, a second group of authors (Marino and colleagues, PLoSOne, 2021-06-30) described the course of the COVID in an independent cohort of patients with DOC. Since our results were quite unexpected, we have been very comforted by the data reported by Marino and colleagues. Moreover, these data also offer a unique opportunity to further evaluate our theory regarding the COVID pathogenesis in patients with DOC. In the current Letter to the Editor it is shown that the independent data presented by Marino and colleagues do support our theory. Waiting for larger cohorts to further test it (and in case falsify it), our interpretation seems to remain valid.","Comanducci, Angela; Viganò, Alessandro; Caronni, Antonio",Brain injury,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487470/; https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.1972456,196

Due to changes in the immune system and respiratory physiology, pregnant women are vulnerable to severe viral pneumonia. We review the clinical course, pregnancy outcomes, and management of women with COVID-19 in pregnancy with a focus on those with kidney involvement. Current evidence does not show an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and the maternal course appears to be similar to non-pregnant patients. However, severe maternal disease can lead to complex management challenges and has shown to be associated with higher incidence of preterm and caesarean births. The risk of congenital infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. All neonates must be considered as high-risk contacts and should be screened at birth and isolated. Pregnant women should follow all measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and this fear should not compromise antenatal care. Use of telemedicine, videoconferencing, and non-invasive fetal and maternal home monitoring devices should be encouraged. High- risk pregnant patients with comorbidities and COVID-19 require hospitalization and close monitoring. Pregnant women with COVID-19 and kidney disease are a high-risk group and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team approach including a nephrologist and neonatologist.","Bajpai, Divya; Shah, Silvi",Adv Chronic Kidney Dis,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2020.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308505/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154855952030121X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S154855952030121X,196
611541,"Hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID‐19: a descriptive observational analysis of 30 cases from a single center in Wuhan, China",2020-06-17,"Background The ability of global health systems to cope with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases is of major concern. In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community. Ongoing attention to maintaining and strengthening the capacity of health care systems and workers to manage cases is needed.","Moss, Robert; Wood, James; Brown, Damien; Shearer, Freya; Black, Andrew J; Cheng, Allen; McCaw, James M; McVernon, Jodie",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056184,196

613087,"Complete Heart Block, Severe Ventricular Dysfunction and Myocardial Inflammation in a Child with COVID-19 Infection",2020-05-27,"BACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the relatively preserved respiratory system compliance despite severe hypoxemia, with specific pulmonary vascular dysfunction, suggests a possible hemodynamic mechanism for VA/Q mismatch, as hypoxic vasoconstriction alteration. This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)–almitrine combination to restore oxygenation in severe COVID-19 ARDS (C-ARDS) patients. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric preliminary pilot study in intubated patients with severe C-ARDS. Respiratory mechanics was assessed after a prone session. Then, patients received iNO (10 ppm) alone and in association with almitrine (10 μg/kg/min) during 30 min in each step. Echocardiographic and blood gases measurements were performed at baseline, during iNO alone, and iNO–almitrine combination. The primary endpoint was the variation of oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio). RESULTS: Ten severe C-ARDS patients were assessed (7 males and 3 females), with a median age of 60 [52–72] years. Combination of iNO and almitrine outperformed iNO alone for oxygenation improvement. The median of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio varied from 102 [89–134] mmHg at baseline, to 124 [108–146] mmHg after iNO (p = 0.13) and 180 [132–206] mmHg after iNO and almitrine (p < 0.01). We found no correlation between the increase in oxygenation caused by iNO–almitrine combination and that caused by proning. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of severe C-ARDS patients, iNO–almitrine combination was associated with rapid and significant improvement of oxygenation. These findings highlight the role of pulmonary vascular function in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Bagate, François; Tuffet, Samuel; Masi, Paul; Perier, François; Razazi, Keyvan; de Prost, Nicolas; Carteaux, Guillaume; Payen, Didier; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150525/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00769-2,196

We compared the characteristics of patients with DKA with and without COVID-19 and their effect on mortality. Research design and methods A retrospective study at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York was performed using ICD-10 codes to identify patients with DKA from March 1 to May 31 in 2019 and 2020. Results While comparing COVID-19 patients with DKA to the DKA patients without COVID-19 in both 2019 and 2020, hispanic patients, males, and type 2 diabetes predominated. COVID-19 patients were older (p=0.010), had more hypertension (p=0.002), and severe lactic acidosis (p=0.006). Mortality for DKA patients with COVID-19 was 57%, for DKA patients without COVID-19 it was 2.1% (p=0.0001), and for diabetic patients (no DKA) with COVID-19 it was 39% (p=0.035). Within the COVID-19 group, older age (mean age 65), (p=0.014), elevated CRP (p=0.012), low O(2) saturation (p=0.001), and beta blocker use (P=0.01) were associated with increased mortality. Conclusions COVID-19 patients are older, have a history of hypertension, more severe DKA and lactic acidosis than patients without COVID-19. There was no increase in DKA with HHS. DKA, but not diabetic parameters, hypertension, and older age predicted a poor outcome.","Patel, Urja; Deluxe, Linda; Salama, Carlos; Jimenez, Aaron Ross; Whiting, Adrian; Lubin, Cedrick; Tarlin, Nancy",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414048/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16427,196
615529,Association between Inflammation-Based Parameters and Prognosis in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury,2021-09-05,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concern for exposure to healthcare providers through aerosol generating procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Current society guidelines recommended limiting use of BAL to reduce operators' risk for infection, yet data on the infection rate for providers after BAL is sparse. Since March 2020, our institution used a modified protocol to perform over 450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients. We therefore sought to describe the subsequent infectious risks to providers associated with BAL. Methods: Fifty-two pulmonary and critical care providers (faculty and fellows) at our tertiary-care, urban medical center were surveyed. Survey participants were asked to provide the number of BALs on COVID-19 patients they performed, the number of weeks they cared for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19, and the results of any SARS-CoV-2 testing that they received. Participants were asked to assess the difficulty of BAL on intubated COVID-19 patients as compared to routine ICU BAL using a numeric perceived difficulty score ranging from 1 (easier) to 10 (harder). Results: We received forty-seven responses from fifty-two surveyed (90% response rate), with 2 declining to participate. Many respondents (19/45, 42%) spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19 patients. The number of BALs performed by providers ranged from 0 to >60. Sixteen of the 35 providers (46%) who performed BALs underwent at least one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to test for SARS-CoV-2, but none were positive. Twenty-seven of the 35 providers (77%) who performed BALs underwent SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, and only one (3.7%) was positive. Respondents indicated occasionally not being able to follow aerosol-minimizing steps but overall felt BALs in COVID-19 patients was only slightly more difficult than routine ICU BAL. Discussion: At a high-volume center having performed >450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients with aerosol-limiting precautions, our survey of bronchoscopists found no positive NP SARS-CoV-2 tests and only one positive antibody test result. While the optimal role for COVID-19 BAL remains to be determined, these data suggest that BAL can be safely performed in intubated COVID-19 patients if experienced providers take precautions to limit aerosol generation and wear personal protective equipment.","Gao, C.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of symptomatic Covid-19 and its correlations with both organ involvement and ongoing treatments in a large series of Italian ASD patients during the first wave of pandemic. METHOD: Our multicenter telephone 6-week survey included 3,029 unselected ASD patients enrolled at 36 tertiary referral centers of northern, central, and southern Italian macro-areas with different diffusion of pandemic. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was classified as definite Covid-19 (presence of symptoms plus positive oral/nasopharyngeal swabs) or highly suspected Covid-19 (highly suggestive symptoms, in absence of a swab testing). RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence of definite plus highly suspected Covid-19 compared to Italian general population was detected in the whole ASD series (p=.000), as well as in patients from the three macro-areas (p=.000 in all). Statistically higher prevalence of Covid-19 was also found in connective tissue diseases compared to chronic arthritis subgroup (p=.000) and in ASD patients with pre-existing interstitial lung involvement (p=.000). Patients treated with either conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or biological DMARDs showed a significantly lower prevalence of Covid-19 (p=.000 in both). Finally, scleroderma patients undergoing low-dose aspirin showed significantly lower rate of Covid-19 compared to those without (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of Covid-19 in ASD patients along with the significant correlations with important clinical features and therapeutic regimens suggests the need to develop targeted prevention/management strategies during the current pandemic wave.","Ferri, Clodoveo; Giuggioli, Dilia; Raimondo, Vincenzo; L'Andolina, Massimo; Dagna, Lorenzo; Tavoni, Antonio; Caso, Francesco; Ursini, Francesco; Ruscitti, Piero; Caminiti, Maurizio; Foti, Rosario; Riccieri, Valeria; Guiducci, Serena; Pellegrini, Roberta; Zanatta, Elisabetta; Varcasia, Giuseppe; Olivo, Domenico; Gigliotti, Pietro; Cuomo, Giovanna; Murdaca, Giuseppe; Cecchetti, Riccardo; De Angelis, Rossella; Romeo, Nicoletta; Ingegnoli, Francesca; Cozzi, Franco; Codullo, Veronica; Cavazzana, Ilaria; Colaci, Michele; Abignano, Giuseppina; De Santis, Maria; Lubrano, Ennio; Fusaro, Enrico; Rossa, Alessandra Della; Spinella, Amelia; Lumetti, Federica; De Luca, Giacomo; Bellando-Randone, Silvia; Visalli, Elisa; Dal Bosco, Ylenia; Amato, Giorgio; Giannini, Daiana; Bilia, Silvia; Masini, Francesco; Pellegrino, Greta; Pigatto, Erika; Generali, Elena; Mariano, Giuseppa Pagano; Pettiti, Giorgio; Zanframundo, Giovanni; Brittelli, Raffaele",Curr. pharm. des,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612827666210903103935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477509/,196

We wonder whether suitable spatial allocation strategies might significantly improve a campaign's efficacy in averting damaging outcomes. To that end, we address the problem of optimal control of COVID-19 vaccinations in a country-wide geographic and epidemiological context characterized by strong spatial heterogeneities in transmission rate and disease history. We seek the vaccine allocation strategies in space and time that minimize the number of infections in a prescribed time horizon. We examine scenarios of unfolding disease transmission across the 107 provinces of Italy, from January to April 2021, generated by a spatially explicit compartmental COVID-19 model tailored to the Italian geographic and epidemiological context. We develop a novel optimal control framework to derive optimal vaccination strategies given the epidemiological projections and constraints on vaccine supply and distribution logistic. Optimal schemes significantly outperform simple alternative allocation strategies based on incidence, population distribution, or prevalence of susceptibles in each province. Our results suggest that the complex interplay between the mobility network and the spatial heterogeneities imply highly non-trivial prioritization of local vaccination campaigns. The extent of the overall improvements in the objectives grants further inquiry aimed at refining other possibly relevant factors so far neglected. Our work thus provides a proof-of-concept of the potential of optimal control for complex and heterogeneous epidemiological contexts at country, and possibly global, scales.","Lemaitre, J.

In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against M. domestica. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of M. domestica depicting an LC(50) at 14.88 mg/ dm(3) which was 17.19 mg/ dm(3) for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD(50), 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC(50) concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against M. domestica.

This situation forced the complete closure of sport practice and national or international competitions, leading to a negative impact on physical and psychological health of high-performance athletes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (a) to determine the effects of the COVID-19 health crisis on Spanish high-performance athletes in terms of sports practice, life quality, and emotional state and (b) to identify the profile with the greatest difficulties during and after the lockdown. A sample of 130 high-performance athletes aged between 18 and 34 years (67 women and 63 men) participated in this study (83.1% achieved a medal in National–International elite competitions; 86.9% were considered student-athletes). Measures included socio-demographic data through a 5-dimension ad hoc survey: physical activity and exercise using an adapted version from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); health status and limitations using an adapted version of SF-12 Health Questionnaire; Perceived stress (Short-PSS); and Mood States (29-item POMS). All participants have shown a significant decrease pre–post-lockdown in both health and performance perception, especially in women, individual athletes, medalists, and student-athletes. Strong limitations of training, attention, and motivation as well as a moderate negative emotional state during lockdown were reported, in women, individual athletes, medalists, and student-athletes. Even with an improved emotional state and energy level in the post-lockdown period, moderate-to-high stress scores were reported by women and medalists. Our findings highlight the importance of paying attention to the physical and psychological health of elite athletes on three profiles: team athletes (due to social distance), student-athletes (dual-career issues), and women athletes (prevalence of implicit gender inequalities in sport).","Conde, Elena; Martínez-Aranda, Luis Manuel; Sanz, Gema; López de Subijana, Cristina; Sánchez-Pato, Antonio; Díaz-Aroca, Álvaro; Leiva-Arcas, Alejandro; García-Roca, Juan Alfonso; Ramis, Yago; Torregrossa, Miquel",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646217/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.736499,196

Seven HIV inhibitors, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir, were used as the potential lead drugs to investigate access to the drug binding sites in M(pro). The frequently accessed sites on M(pro) were classified based on contacts between the ligands and the protein, and the differences in site distributions of the encounter complex were observed among the ligands. All seven ligands showed binding to the active site at least twice in 28 simulations of 200 ns each. We further investigated the variations in the complex structure of the active site with the ligands, using microsecond order simulations. Results revealed a wide variation in the shapes of the binding sites and binding poses of the ligands. Additionally, the C-terminal region of the other chain often interacted with the ligands and the active site. Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of dynamic sampling of protein–ligand complexes and suggest the possibilities of further drug optimisations.","Komatsu, Teruhisa S.; Okimoto, Noriaki; Koyama, Yohei M.; Hirano, Yoshinori; Morimoto, Gentaro; Ohno, Yousuke; Taiji, Makoto",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046764/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74099-5,196

Healthcare systems worldwide are under great pressure, and there is an urgent need for effective antiviral treatments. The only currently approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral genome replication. SARS-CoV-2 proliferation relies on the enzymatic activities of the non-structural proteins (nsp), which makes them interesting targets for the development of new antiviral treatments. With the aim to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we have purified the exoribonuclease/methyltransferase (nsp14) and its cofactor (nsp10) and developed biochemical assays compatible with high-throughput approaches to screen for exoribonuclease inhibitors. We have screened a library of over 5000 commercial compounds and identified patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as inhibitors of nsp14 exoribonuclease in vitro. We found that patulin and ATA inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a VERO E6 cell-culture model.

Thus far, sensitivity ([≤]85%) of lateral-flow assays has limited scale-up. Conceivably, microfluidic immunofluorescence Ag-RDTs could increase sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Materials and Methods: This multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study investigated performance of the microfluidic immunofluorescence LumiraDx assay, enrolling symptomatic and asymptomatic participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants collected a supervised nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) self-swab for Ag-RDT testing, in addition to a professionally-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for routine testing with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results were compared to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Sub-analyses investigated the results by viral load, symptom presence and duration. An analytical study assessed exclusivity and limit-of-detection (LOD). In addition, we evaluated ease-of-use. Results: Study conduct was between November 2nd 2020 and January 21st 2021. 761 participants were enrolled, with 486 participants reporting symptoms on testing day. 120 out of 146 RT-PCR positive cases were detected positive by LumiraDx, resulting in a sensitivity of 82.2% (95% CI: 75.2%-87.5%). Specificity was 99.3% (CI: 98.3-99.7%). Sensitivity was increased in individuals with viral load [≥] 7 log10 SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/ml (93.8%; CI: 86.2%-97.3%). Testing against common respiratory commensals and pathogens showed no cross-reactivity and LOD was estimated to be 2-56 PFU/mL.

624635,Post-COVID-19 Necrotizing Pneumonia in Patients on Invasive Mechanical Ventilation,2021-09-08,"Tom70 is a versatile adaptor protein of 70 kDa anchored in the outer membrane of mitochondria in metazoa, fungi and amoeba. The tertiary structure was resolved for the Tom70 of yeast, showing 26 α-helices, most of them participating in the formation of 11 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Tom70 serves as a docking site for cytosolic chaperone proteins and co-chaperones and is thereby involved in the uptake of newly synthesized chaperone-bound proteins in mitochondrial biogenesis. In yeast, Tom70 additionally mediates ER-mitochondria contacts via binding to sterol transporter Lam6/Ltc1. In mammalian cells, TOM70 promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer by association with the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3). TOM70 is specifically targeted by the Bcl-2-related protein MCL-1 that acts as an anti-apoptotic protein in macrophages infected by intracellular pathogens, but also in many cancer cells. By participating in the recruitment of PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, TOM70 can be implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease. TOM70 acts as receptor of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and thereby participates in the corresponding system of innate immunity against viral infections. The protein encoded by Orf9b in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 binds to TOM70, probably compromising the synthesis of type I interferons.","Kreimendahl, Sebastian; Rassow, Joachim",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21197262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019591/,196

We tested the feasibility of chest X-ray (CXR)-based radiomics metrics to develop machine-learning algorithms for predicting patients with poor outcomes. METHODS: In this Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant, retrospective study, we evaluated CXRs performed around the time of admission from 167 COVID-19 patients. Of the 167 patients, 68 (40.72%) required intensive care during their stay, 45 (26.95%) required intubation, and 25 (14.97%) died. Lung opacities were manually segmented using ITK-SNAP (open-source software). CaPTk (open-source software) was used to perform 2D radiomics analysis. RESULTS: Of all the algorithms considered, the AdaBoost classifier performed the best with AUC = 0.72 to predict the need for intubation, AUC = 0.71 to predict death, and AUC = 0.61 to predict the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). AdaBoost had similar performance with ElasticNet in predicting the need for admission to ICU. Analysis of the key radiomic metrics that drive model prediction and performance showed the importance of first-order texture metrics compared to other radiomics panel metrics. Using a Venn-diagram analysis, two first-order texture metrics and one second-order texture metric that consistently played an important role in driving model performance in all three outcome predictions were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the quantitative nature and reliability of radiomic metrics, they can be used prospectively as prognostic markers to individualize treatment plans for COVID-19 patients and also assist with healthcare resource management. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: We report on the performance of CXR-based imaging metrics extracted from RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients at admission to develop machine-learning algorithms for predicting the need for ICU, the need for intubation, and mortality, respectively.","Varghese, Bino Abel; Shin, Heeseop; Desai, Bhushan; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali; Lei, Xiaomeng; Perkins, Melissa; Oberai, Assad; Nanda, Neha; Cen, Steven; Duddalwar, Vinay",Br J Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20210221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520246/,196

626666,The Effect of Pandemic Prevalence on the Reported Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021-06-07,"Enveloped viruses and cellular transport vesicles share obvious morphological and functional properties. Both are composed of a closed membrane, which is lined with coat proteins and encases cargo. Transmembrane proteins inserted into the membrane define the target membrane area with which the vesicle or virus is destined to fuse. Here we discuss recent insight into the functioning of enveloped viruses in the framework of the “functional module” concept. Vesicular transport is an exemplary case of a functional module, as defined as a part of the proteome that assembles to perform a specific autonomous function in a living cell. Cellular vesicles serve to transport cargo between membranous organelles inside the cell, while enveloped viruses can be seen as carriers of the viral genome delivering their cargo from an infected to an uninfected cell. The turnover of both vesicles and viruses involves an analogous series of submodular events. This comprises assembly of elements, budding from the donor compartment, uncoating and/or maturation, docking to and finally fusion with the target membrane to release the cargo. This modular perception enables us to define submodular building blocks so that mechanisms and elements can be directly compared. It will be analyzed where viruses have developed their own specific strategy, where they share functional schemes with vesicles, and also where they even have “hijacked” complete submodular schemes from the cell. Such a perspective may also include new and more specific approaches to pharmacological interference with virus function, which could avoid some of the most severe side effects.","Thaa, Bastian; Hofmann, Klaus Peter; Veit, Michael",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488910000121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488910000121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100522/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.011,196

Schools are valuable social institutions to this effect and school safety and adolescent health outcomes can be threatened by drug use and violence. As such, collaborative, multi-level, evidence-based, developmentally sensitive, substance use prevention programs are imperative. The International Standards, in their latest version, did not reflect specific evidence of law enforcement officer-based programs with effect on drug use prevention, including in school settings. Nevertheless, the collaboration between law enforcement agencies and school-based substance use prevention programs continue to be the focus of research and policy. In this project, we aim to explore in more detail the role of law enforcement in preventing substance use in schools. We use mixed methods, including three phases: (i) scoping review on the best practices for effective law enforcement in school-based drug and crime prevention; (ii) interviews with experts, using the Delphi method, in substance use prevention and training law enforcement in school-based drug prevention; and iii) developing guidelines for law enforcement based on the findings. Initially, we identified a total of 17 papers that were categorized in four categories based on their results (negative or null effect n = 11 studies, positive effect n = 1 study, mixed effects n = 4 studies and indefinite conclusion n = 1 study). However, the authors of the studies with negative or null effect did recommend being cautious about these results due to the respective studies’ methodological limitations. The actual and perceived roles of police are largely unclear and/or variable. Therefore, clear outlines regarding law enforcement’s role within schools are crucial as one study showed that an officer’s role influences how they respond to student conduct. A secondary emergent theme from this review indicates that there is potential for positively impacting a youth’s perceptions of police through collaborative and engaging school-based programs. Currently the project is gradually moving to Phase II, where we are identifying the key experts based on scientifically published peer reviewed and grey literature/guidelines to investigate elements that make the role of law enforcement officers in school-based prevention more effective. Given the frequency with which policy makers around the world request information about the role of law enforcement in effective prevention efforts, guidelines on their roles within schools is a gap that needs to be filled. Such efforts would improve drug prevention in schools and better orient law enforcement’s role in drug prevention within educational settings.","El-Khatib, Ziad; Herrera, Celina; Campello, Giovanna; Mattfeld, Elizabeth; Maalouf, Wadih",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807797/,196

Toroviruses appear to occur worldwide, and torovirus-like particles in fecal preparations have been reported from Europe, the Americas, Asia, New Zealand, and South Africa. These viruses have a unique C-shape or open torus morphology in the extracellular environment. There are four recognized species in the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales): Equine torovirus, Bovine torovirus, Human torovirus, and Porcine torovirus. Among them there is little genetic divergence (20–40%). Antigenic cross-reactivity has revealed a relationship between equine torovirus (EToV), bovine torovirus (BToV), and human torovirus (HToV). The torovirus genome contains six open reading frames (ORFs), which are transcribed as a 3′ co-terminal nested set of four mRNAs. ORF1a and -1b encode the replicase, and ORFs 2–5 encode the spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively. EToV is apathogenic, and the only torovirus that has been grown in vitro. All BToV strains are pathogenic, causing diarrhea in experimentally or naturally infected calves.

The objective of this study was to determine the clinical course and risk factors for patients showing recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. A total of 1087 COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Advanced age was significantly associated with mortality. In addition, 81 (7.6%) of the discharged patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the isolation period. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to recurrence was 50 days. Multivariate regression analysis identified elevated serum IL-6, increased lymphocyte counts and CT imaging features of lung consolidation during hospitalization as the independent risk factors of recurrence. We hypothesized that the balance between immune response and virus toxicity may be the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. For patients with a high risk of recurrence, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.","Chen, Jie; Xu, Xiaoping; Hu, Jing; Chen, Qiangda; Xu, Fengfeng; Liang, Hui; Liu, Nanmei; Zhu, Hengmei; Lan, Jinlong; Zhou, Lan; Xing, Jiajun; Pu, Ning; Cai, Zhigang",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909961/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103795,196

Approximately 11.5 to 66 million U.S. adults may suffer from this condition. This population often avoids seeking medical care including vaccinations. The exact number of people suffering from this phobia is unknown, and the potential years of life lost in the American health care system cannot be estimated accurately. The resistance to vaccinations among this population may delay achieving herd immunity to end this current pandemic. An overview of needle phobia, vaccinations, and current treatments are explored. The use of telemedicine could prove critical for reaching this population as well as those who are hesitant about vaccinations.

Amidst growing concerns that the health care system could face a shortage of ventilators in the future, there is a need for an affordable, simple, easy to use, emergency stockpile ventilator. METHODS: Our team of engineers and clinicians designed and tested an emergency ventilator that uses a single limb portable ventilator circuit. The circuit is controlled by a pneumatic signal with electronic microcontroller input, using air and oxygen sources found in standard patient rooms. Ventilator performance was assessed using an IngMar ASL 5000 breathing simulator, and it was compared with a commercially available mechanical ventilator. RESULTS: The emergency ventilator provides volume control mode, intermittent mandatory ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure. It can generate tidal volumes between 300 and 800 mL with <10% error, with pressure, volume, and waveforms substantially equivalent to existing commercial ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a cost effective, safe, and easy to use ventilator that can be rapidly manufactured to address ventilator shortages in a pandemic setting. It meets basic clinical needs and can be provided for emergency use in cases requiring mechanical ventilation because of complications due to respiratory failure from infectious diseases.","Knorr, Jacob M.; Sheehan, Megan M.; Santana, Daniel C.; Samorezov, Sergey; Sammour, Ibrahim; Deblock, Michael; Kuban, Barry; Chaisson, Neal; Chatburn, Robert L.",Can J Respir Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043131/; https://doi.org/10.29390/cjrt-2020-023,196

The HIS-tagged fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was then built and purified for the binding assay in vitro. The co-localization of SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 in the cytoplasm of HEK293FT cells was also shown using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is suggested that their interaction might be through direct combination. Under a fluorescence microscope, it was observed that the purified fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was attached to the cell membrane of CXCL16-transfected cells, indicating that SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 can be mutually combined.","Zhang, Yuan-peng; Zhang, Rong-wu; Chang, Wei-shan; Wang, Yan-yan",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20960183/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-010-3129-x,196

The novel map represents Covid-19 discrete-time dynamics standing for the infected, cumulative infected and vaccinated populations. The simplicity of the discrete description allows the analytical calculation of useful information to evaluate the epidemic stage and to support decision making. In this regard, it should be pointed out the estimation of the number death cases and the herd immunization point. Numerical simulations show the model capacity to describe Covid-19 dynamics properly representing real data and describing different scenario patterns. Real data of Germany, Italy and Brazil are of concern to verify the model ability to describe Covid-19 dynamics.

Immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies are more susceptible to COVID-19 and at higher risk of severe complications and worse outcomes compared with general population. In this context, we evaluated the humoral response by determining the titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) after vaccination with the BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccine. An FDA-approved, ELISA-based methodology was implemented to evaluate NAbs on the day of the first vaccine shot, as well as on day 22 and 50 afterwards. 106 patients with WM (43% males, median age 73 years) and 212 healthy controls (46% males, median age 66 years) who were vaccinated during the same period, at the same center were enrolled in the study (which is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04743388). Our data indicate that vaccination with either 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or 1 dose of the AZD1222 vaccine leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM compared with controls both on day 22 and on day 50 (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Disease-related immune dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression are involved in the low humoral response. Importantly, active treatment with either Rituximab or Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors was proven as an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal antibody response following vaccination. In conclusion, patients with WM have low humoral response following COVID-19 vaccination, which underlines the need for timely vaccination ideally during a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures.","Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Terpos, Evangelos; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Gumeni, Sentiljana; Malandrakis, Panagiotis; Fotiou, Despina; Migkou, Magdalini; Theodorakakou, Foteini; Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, Evangelos; Kanellias, Nikolaos; Kastritis, Efstathios; Trougakos, Ioannis P; Dimopoulos, Meletios A",Blood Adv,https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005444; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2473952921005759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529762/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2473952921005759?v=s5,196

We reviewed the existing literature on MRSA prevalence in Canada over time and in diverse populations across the country. MRSA prevalence increased steadily in the 1990s and 2000s and remains a public health concern in Canada, especially among vulnerable populations, such as rural, remote, and Indigenous communities. Antibiotic resistance patterns and risk factors for MRSA infection were also reported. All studies reported high susceptibility (>85%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with no significant resistance reported for vancomycin, linezolid, or rifampin. While MRSA continues to have susceptibility to several antibiotics, the high and sometimes variable resistance rates to other drugs underscores the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. Risk factors for high MRSA infection rates related to infection control measures, low socioeconomic status, and personal demographic characteristics were also reported. Additional surveillance, infection control measures, enhanced anti-microbial stewardship, and community education programs are necessary to decrease MRSA prevalence and minimize the public health risk posed by this pathogen.","Mitevska, Elena; Wong, Britney; Surewaard, Bas G.

Here, we formulate agent-based models that simulate the spread of a respiratory infectious disease in a train wagon in the Manila Light Rail Transit System, and in a 49-seater public utility bus. We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing, and limitation of interaction or movement among the commuters to investigate how these measures will inhibit disease transmission. We also consider the effect of protective gears and practices, crowd density, and prevalence of disease in the community on the possible number of newly-infected individuals. Our simulations show that (i) individuals must have protection with more than 90% effectiveness to inhibit transmission of the disease; (ii) social or physical distancing by more than 1m distance reduces the risk of being infected; (iii) minimizing movement or interaction with other passengers reduces the risk of transmission by 50%; (iv) passenger capacity should be less than 10-50% of the maximum seating capacity to reduce the number of infections depending on the level of imposed social distancing and passenger interaction; (v) vehicles with greater number of occupied seating capacity generate higher number of infections but vehicles with smaller dimensions have faster disease transmissions; and (vi) ideal set-up for a 24-seater train wagon (49-seater bus) is to allow a maximum of 12 (24) passengers, with little to no interaction among passengers, with social distancing of more than 1m distance apart, and each person has a protection with 90% effectiveness as much as possible.

The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO. Methods This retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris–Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS. Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected. Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1–4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death. Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition. Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020. Findings From March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs. Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41–56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO. Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16–21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54–68) mm Hg. At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3–14) for state 1, 18% (11–28) for state 2, 45% (35–56) for state 3, and 31% (22–42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke. 30 patients died. Interpretation The estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS. If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO should be considered for patients developing refractory respiratory failure despite optimised care.

The emergence of new infectious diseases and increase in frequency of drug resistant viruses demand effective and novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we used bioinformatics approach to investigate the possible inhibitory potentials of phytochemical constituents of Vernonia amygdalina towards coronavirus-2 major protease. Pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicological profiles of the compounds were also examined using the pkCSM server. All the phytochemicals showed good binding affinity to the binding pocket of PDB ID 6LU7. It was observed that veronicoside A exhibited the highest binding affinity when compared to remdesivir, hydroxy-vernolide, vernodalin, vernodalol, and vernolide. The amino acids LEU272, LEU287, GLY275, TYR237, LYS236, THR198, THR199, ARG131, and LYS5 were showed as the key residues for veronicoside A binding to human SARS-COV2 major protease. The Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics results suggested that all the tested phytochemicals have significant drug likeness properties and they could be absorbed through the human intestine. Furthermore, all the tested phytochemicals are not hepatoxic and also exhibited non or relatively low toxic effects in human. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that all the tested phytochemicals are potential putative inhibitors of SARS-COV2 major protease with non or low toxicity effects.

Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single tertiary care hospital and included consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables, including required oxygen supplementation, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality, were examined. Results: Fifty-six patients were included in the study. The median age was 54.5 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (78 vs. 50 years; P = .0013). RNAemia was detected in 19.6% of patients (11/56) and in 1.0% (1/25), 50.0% (6/12), and 100.0% (4/4) of moderate, severe, and critically ill cases, respectively. Patients with RNAemia required more frequent oxygen supplementation (90.0% vs. 13.3%; P < .0001) and ICU admission (81.8% vs. 6.7%; P < .0001) and required invasive mechanical ventilation (27.3% vs. 0.0%; P < .0001). Among patients with RNAemia, the median viral loads of NP swabs that were collected around the same time as the serum were significantly higher in critically ill cases (5.4 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 4.2-6.3]) than in moderate-severe cases (2.6 Log10 copies/L [1.1-4.5]; P =.030) and were significantly higher in nonsurvivor cases (6.2 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 6.0-6.5]) than in survivor cases (3.9 Log10 copies/L [1.6-4.6]; P =.045). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a relatively high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity. Moreover, among the patients with RNAemia, the viral loads of NP swabs were correlated with severity and mortality, thus suggesting the potential utility of combining serum testing with NP tests as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 with a higher quality than each separate test.","Kawasuji, H.; Morinaga, Y.; Tani, H.; Yoshida, Y.; Takegoshi, Y.; Kaneda, M.; Murai, Y.; Kimoto, K.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Kawago, K.; Fukui, Y.; Kimura, M.; Yamada, H.; Sakamaki, I.; Yamamoto, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248388v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.17.20248388,196
637649,Difficulties of Managing Submassive and Massive Pulmonary Embolism in the era of COVID-19,2020-05-19,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Global Strategy (2016–30) emphasize that all women, children and adolescents ‘survive, thrive and transform’. A key element of this global policy framework is that gender equality is a stand-alone goal as well as a cross-cutting priority. Gender inequality and intersecting social and structural determinants shape health systems, including the content of policy documents, with implications for implementation. This article applies a gender lens to policy documents by national government bodies that have mandates on adolescent health in South Africa. Data were 15 policy documents, authored between 2003 and 2018, by multiple actors. The content analysis was guided by key lines of enquiry, and policy documents were classified along the continuum of gender blind to gender transformative. Only three policy documents defined gender, and if gender was addressed, it was mostly in gender-sensitive ways, at times gender specific, but rarely gender transformative. Building on this, a critical discourse analysis identified what is problematized and what is left unproblematized by actors, identifying the key interrelated dominant and marginalized discourses, as well as the ‘silences’ embedded in policy documents. The discourse analysis revealed that dominant and marginalized discourses reflect how gender is conceptualized as fixed, categorical identities, vs as fluid social processes, with implications for how rights and risks are understood. The discourses substantiate an over-riding focus on adolescent girls, outside of the context of power relations, with minimal attention to boys in terms of their own health or through a gender lens, as well as little consideration of LGBTIQ+ adolescents beyond HIV. Dynamic and complex relationships exist between the South Africa context, actors, content and processes, in shaping both how gender is problematized and how ‘solutions’ are represented in these policies. How gender is conceptualized matters, both for policy analysis and for praxis, and policy documents can be part of foundations for transforming gender and intersecting power relations.","Jacobs, Tanya; George, Asha; De Jong, Michelle",Health Policy Plan,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czab041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852727/,196

This nationally funded study is analysing the response of the Colombian health system to the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on qualitative case studies of three local health systems within the country. The approach will be informed by the concept of ‘major system change’—or coordinated change among a variety of healthcare organizations and other relevant stakeholders— to identify processes that both enable and inhibit adaptation of health services to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The study will collect information on capacity ‘bottlenecks’ as well as successful practices and forms of innovation that have emerged locally, which have the potential for being ‘scaled up’ across Colombia’s health services. METHODS/DESIGN: This qualitative study will be undertaken in two phases. In the first, up to 30 stakeholder interviews will be conducted to ascertain immediate challenges and opportunities for improvement in response to COVID-19 that can be shared in a timely way with health service leaders to inform health service planning. The stakeholders will include planning, provider and intermediary organizations within the health system at the national level. In the second, up to 60 further interviews will be conducted to develop in-depth case studies of three local health systems at the metropolitan area level within Colombia. The interview data will be supplemented with documentary analysis and, where feasible, non-participant observation of planning meetings. DISCUSSION: The study’s findings will aid evaluation of the relevance of the concept of major system change in a context of ‘crisis’ decision-making and contribute to international lessons on improving health systems’ capacity to respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Study findings will be shared among various stakeholders in the Colombian healthcare system in a formative and timely way in order to inform healthcare planning in response to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Conducting the study at a time of COVID-19 raises a number of practical issues (including physical distancing and pressure on health services) which have been anticipated in the study design and research team’s ways of working.","Turner, Simon; Niño, Natalia",Implement Sci Commun,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-020-00063-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939458/,196

This genome limitation forces them to gain control over cellular processes to ensure their successful propagation. A diverse spectrum of virally encoded proteins tackling a broad spectrum of cellular pathways during most steps of the viral life cycle ranging from the host cell entry to viral protein translation has evolved. Since the host cell PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical regulatory role in many cellular processes including RNA processing, translation, autophagy and apoptosis, many viruses, in widely varying ways, target it. This review focuses on a number of remarkable examples of viral strategies, which exploit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for effective viral replication.","Diehl, Nora; Schaal, Heiner",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v5123192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24351799/,196

DESIGN: Nationwide seroepidemiological study. SETTING: First wave of covid-19 pandemic in Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Community dwelling individuals of all ages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was overall, and age and sex specific, infection fatality risk for SARS-CoV-2 (the number of covid-19 deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections) in the community dwelling Spanish population. Deaths with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo), up to 15 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections in Spain were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61 098 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide seroepidemiological survey between 27 April and 22 June 2020. RESULTS: The overall infection fatality risk was 0.8% (19 228 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed covid-19 deaths and 1.1% (24 778 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The infection fatality risk was 1.1% (95% confidence interval 1.0% to 1.2%) to 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) to 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The infection fatality risk increased sharply after age 50, ranging from 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) to 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men aged 80 or more and from 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) to 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women aged 80 or more. CONCLUSION: The increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality risk after age 50 appeared to be more noticeable in men than in women. Based on the results of this study, fatality from covid-19 was greater than that reported for other common respiratory diseases, such as seasonal influenza.","Pastor-Barriuso, Roberto; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Hernán, Miguel A; Pérez-Olmeda, Mayte; Yotti, Raquel; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesús; Sanmartín, Jose L; León-Gómez, Inmaculada; Fernández-García, Aurora; Fernández-Navarro, Pablo; Cruz, Israel; Martín, Mariano; Delgado-Sanz, Concepción; Fernández de Larrea, Nerea; León Paniagua, Jose; Muñoz-Montalvo, Juan F; Blanco, Faustino; Larrauri, Amparo; Pollán, Marina; Aparicio Azcárraga, Pilar; Blanco, Faustino; Gutiérrez Fernández, Rodrigo; Martín, Mariano; Mezcua Navarro, Saturnino; Molina, Marta; Muñoz-Montalvo, Juan F; Salinero Hernández, Matías; Sanmartín, Jose L; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; León Paniagua, José; Yotti, Raquel; Delgado-Sanz, Concepción; Fernández de Larrea, Nerea; Fernández-Navarro, Pablo; Gómez-Barroso, Diana; Larrauri, Amparo; León-Gómez, Inmaculada; Pastor-Barriuso, Roberto; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Pollán, Marina; Avellón, Ana; Fedele, Giovanni; Fernández-García, Aurora; Oteo Iglesias, Jesús; Pérez Olmeda, María Teresa; Cruz, Israel; Fernández Martínez, Maria Elena; Rodríguez-Cabrera, Francisco D; Hernán, Miguel A; Padrones Fernández, Susana; Rumbao Aguirre, José Manuel; Navarro Marí, José M; Palop Borrás, Begoña; Pérez Jiménez, Ana Belén; Rodríguez-Iglesias, Manuel; Calvo Gascón, Ana María; Lou Alcaine, María Luz; Donate Suárez, Ignacio; Suárez Álvarez, Oscar; Rodríguez Pérez, Mercedes; Cases Sanchís, Margarita; Villafáfila Gomila, Carlos Javier; Carbo Saladrigas, Lluis; Hurtado Fernández, Adoración; Oliver, Antonio; Castro Feliciano, Elías; González Quintana, María Noemí; Barrasa Fernández, José María; Hernández Betancor, María Araceli; Hernández Febles, Melisa; Martín Martín, Leopoldo; López López, Luis-Mariano; Ugarte Miota, Teresa; De Benito Población, Inés; Celada Pérez, María Sagrario; Vallés Fernández, María Natalia; Maté Enríquez, Tomás; Villa Arranz, Miguel; Domínguez-Gil González, Marta; Fernández-Natal, Isabel; Megías Lobón, Gregoria; Muñoz Bellido, Juan Luis; Ciruela, Pilar; Mas i Casals, Ariadna; Doladé Botías, Maria; Marcos Maeso, M Angeles; Pérez del Campo, Dúnia; Félix de Castro, Antonio; Limón Ramírez, Ramón; Elías Retamosa, Maria Francisca; Rubio González, Manuela; Blanco Lobeiras, María Sinda; Fuentes Losada, Alberto; Aguilera, Antonio; Bou, German; Caro, Yolanda; Marauri, Noemí; Soria Blanco, Luis Miguel; del Cura González, Isabel; Hernández Pascual, Montserrat; Alonso Fernández, Roberto; Merino-Amador, Paloma; Cabrera Castro, Natalia; Tomás Lizcano, Aurora; Ramírez Almagro, Cristóbal; Segovia Hernández, Manuel; Ascunce Elizaga, Nieves; Ederra Sanz, María; Ezpeleta Baquedano, Carmen; Bustinduy Bascaran, Ana; Iglesias Tamayo, Susana; Elorduy Otazua, Luis; Benarroch Benarroch, Rebeca; Lopera Flores, Jesús; Vázquez de la Villa, Antonia",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246972/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4509,196

We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western Australia. Cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOR; 95% CI) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% CI) for pneumonia was estimated. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). At least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOR: 58.4; 95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOR: 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively.

Many efforts have been made to create vaccines and develop new antiviral drugs to cope with the disease. Here, we propose the application of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to degrade the viral genome, thus reducing viral infection. By introducing the concept of the probability of binding efficiency (PBE) and combining the secondary structures of RNA molecules, we designed 11 siRNAs that target the consensus regions of three key viral genes: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) genes of SARS-CoV-2. The silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were determined in human lung and endothelial cells overexpressing these viral genes. The results suggested that most of the siRNAs could significantly reduce the expression of the viral genes with inhibition rates above 50% in 24 hours. This work not only provides a strategy for designing potentially effective siRNAs against target genes but also validates several potent siRNAs that can be used in the clinical development of preventative medication for COVID-19 in the future.","Wu, Renfei; Luo, Kathy Qian",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.59151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907515/,196

Iran, as one of the first countries to experience the onset of the virus outbreak, made and implemented some policies that should be assessed, so that lessons may be learned for the future. Although some negative actions and policies, such as delays in cancellation of international flights especially from China, not taking the disease seriously and comparing it with seasonal influenza, and the like, are hard to ignore, some impressive actions are also vividly clear. Policies, such as social distancing, dramatically increasing social awareness about preventive actions in terms of public health, and using masks and hand washing, were cost-effective policies that resulted in successful control of the virus in the first onset. While some quite clearly ineffective decisions were made by Iranian authorities, the huge catastrophic effect of sanctions cannot be forgotten.

We systematically reviewed databases until August 15, 2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts, and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, and so on. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti‐viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and and so on. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug‐induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions, which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. Lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life‐threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug‐induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID‐19.","Najar Nobari, Niloufar; Seirafianpour, Farnoosh; Mashayekhi, Farzaneh; Goodarzi, Azadeh",Dermatol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.14662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301232/,196

Data were obtained from 2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates to create an SES index by ZCTA. Other predictors obtained from 2018 census data were the proportions of white residents, Hispanic residents and residents ≥ 65 years old. Multivariable Poisson regressions were performed to assess the rate of change for antibody testing and positivity, and to assess the independent associations with SES, race and age. Results: There was a significant association between the rate of antibody tests and SES quartiles (Q1: β(adj) = 0.04, Q2: β(adj) = 0.03 and Q3: β(adj) = − 0.03, compared to Q4), and the proportion of residents who are white (β(adj) = 0.004, p < .0001), Hispanic (β(adj) = 0.001, p < .0001), and ≥ 65 years (β(adj) = 0.01, p < .0001).

In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may impact general cardiovascular risk for years to come, and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions. From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence. Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute cardiovascular events. Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and mis-information may have negatively impacted adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents. From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to income loss, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse cardiovascular risk-factor control and outcomes. We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health impacts of COVID-19.","Lau, Darren; McAlister, Finlay A.",Can J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.11.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20310722; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20310722?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212203/,196

À l’hôpital Avicenne, l’augmentation de 16 à 40 lits de réanimation n’a pas permis de répondre complètement à la demande. Cela a conduit à la mise en place d’une unité de soins intensifs respiratoires (USIR) de 10 lits à l’aide de matériel d’assistance respiratoire de domicile. Notre objectif est de décrire les modalités de mise en place de cette unité. Méthodes Les lits d’USIR ont été localisés au sein d’un service d’orthopédie avec une infirmière pour 5 patients. Chaque chambre a été équipée d’un ventilateur Trilogy Evo (Philips-Respironics) mis à disposition par Asten Santé. L’oxygénothérapie à haut débit était délivrée à l’aide de systèmes de domicile Airvo2 (Fisher-Paykel). Chaque chambre a été équipée d’un système de surveillance continue développé spécifiquement pour cette USIR. Le système de surveillance comprenait un oxymètre de pouls (Nonin Xpod) connecté au ventilateur. À l’aide d’un driver co-développé par Philips et Kernel Biomedical, le ventilateur transmettait les données en temps réel à un ordinateur (Raspeberry Pi). L’ordinateur localisé dans la chambre transmettait en temps réel les données d’oxymétrie et de la ventilation (volume courant, fuites, fréquence respiratoire, asynchronismes) à un serveur de surveillance accessible depuis l’ensemble des postes informatiques du service et sur lequel des alarmes sonores et visuelles pouvaient être réglées de manière individuelle (Fig. 1). Résultats De l’identification du besoin à la mise en place de l’USIR, 12jours se sont écoulés. Un total de 38 patients a été admis au cours du mois d’avril. Les personnels paramédicaux ont reçu une formation dédiée à la prise en charge des patients de cette USIR notamment relative aux modalités techniques. Une permanence des soins sur place était assurée par l’équipe de pneumologie 24h/24. Le nombre moyen d’alarmes de désaturation (<90 %) était de : 8,1±10,0/h et le nombre moyen d’alarmes de fuites excessive (>40 L/min) était de 6,7±12,9/h, soulignant la sévérité des patients admis. Aucun événement indésirable grave lié à l’utilisation du matériel ou au système de monitoring n’est survenu.

648167,A Case Series of Black and Hispanic COVID-19 Patients Treated with ECMO,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Globally, tobacco smoking remains the largest cause of premature death. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced nations to take unprecedented measures including ‘lockdowns’ that might impact tobacco smoking behaviour. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess smoking behaviour changes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched Medline/Embase/PsycINFO/BioRxiv/MedRxiv/SSRN databases (January-November 2020) for published and pre-print articles that reported specific smoking behaviour changes or intentions after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used random-effects models to pool prevalence ratios comparing the prevalence of smokers during and before the pandemic, and the prevalence of smoking behaviour changes. RESULTS: 33 studies were included in meta-analyses, with smoking data for ∼230,000 participants across 24 countries. The proportions of smokers during and before the pandemic were similar, with a pooled prevalence ratio 0.85 (95%CI:0.76-0.95). In studies limited to smokers, 27% (95%CI:21-32%) smoked more, 17% (95%CI:13-21%) smoked less, 54% (95%CI:47-61%) smoked the same and 5% (95%CI:2-9%) reported quitting smoking. Among all participants, 1% (95%CI:0-2%) started smoking during the pandemic. All studies were at high risk of bias due to use of non-representative samples, likely non-response bias, and utilisation of non-validated questions. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking behaviour changes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly mixed. Meta-analyses indicated slightly lower overall smoking prevalence during the pandemic, but higher intensity among smokers. KEY MESSAGES: More recent and higher quality studies of smoking behaviour changes are required to measure the longer term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vaneckova, Pavla; Sarich, Peter; Cabasag, Citadel Jungco; Liebermann, Erica; Carle, Chelsea; Hughes, Suzanne; Egger, Sam; O'Connell, Dianne; Weber, Marianne; da Costa, Allini Mafra; Caruana, Michael; Gouda, Hebe; Canfell, Karen; Ginsburg, Ophira; Steinberg, Julia; Soerjomataram, Isabelle",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab168.679,196

METHODS: Among 4855 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital, 839 were positive and of these 189 died from COVID-19. Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: BMI was associated strongly with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID-19 related death (P(interaction) = 0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity (P(interaction) = 0.010) and death (P(interaction) = 0.002) in non-whites (predominantly South Asians and Afro-Caribbean's), compared with whites. CONCLUSIONS: These data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in younger people and non-white ethnicities. If future studies confirm causality, lifestyle interventions to improve adiposity status may be important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in all, but perhaps particularly, non-white communities.","Sattar, Naveed; Ho, Frederick K.; Gill, Jason MR.; Ghouri, Nazim; Gray, Stuart R.; Celis-Morales, Carlos A.; Katikireddi, S.

In addition, a subset of B cells, known as regulatory B cells (Bregs), exhibit immunosuppressive functions via diverse regulatory mechanisms. Bregs modulate immune responses via the secretion of IL‐10, IL‐35, and tumor growth factor‐β (TGF‐β), and by direct cell contact. The balance between effector and regulatory B cell functions is critical in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. The importance of Bregs in airway immune responses is emphasized by the different respiratory disorders associated with abnormalities in Breg numbers and function. In this review, we summarize the role of immunosuppressive Bregs in airway inflammatory diseases and highlight the importance of this subset in the maintenance of respiratory health. We propose that improved understanding of signals in the lung microenvironment that drive Breg differentiation can provide novel therapeutic avenues for improved management of respiratory diseases.","Menon, Madhvi; Hussell, Tracy; Ali Shuwa, Halima",Immunol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410165/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12941,196

METHODS: Analyzing Covid-19 cases, deaths, and tests in Ontario, Canada, we compared the CFR between the first wave and the second wave across 26 Public Health Units in Ontario. We also explored whether a high testing rate was associated with a large CFR decrease. RESULTS: The first wave CFR ranged from 0.004 to 0.146; whereas the second wave CFR ranged from 0.003 to 0.034. The pooled RR estimate of the second wave Covid-19 case fatality, compared to first wave, was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19-0.32). Additionally, Covid-19 testing percentages were not associated with the estimated RR (p-value = 0.246). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 CFR decreased profoundly in Ontario during the second wave, and Covid-19 testing was not a driving factor for this decrease.","Hsu, Sylvia H.; Chang, Su-Hsin; Gross, Cary; Wang, Shi-Yi",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216734/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.06.059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221005488?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221005488,196

The current members are Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Because arteriviruses share with coronaviruses a similar genome organization, conserved replicase motifs, and a common genome expression strategy, which includes a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to generate multiple subgenomic RNAs, they have been joined in the order Nidovirales. However, arteriviruses differ from coronaviruses in the smaller size of their genomes, the smaller size and morphology of their virions, and the properties of their structural proteins. The arteriviruses each have distinct narrow host ranges but are widely distributed geographically. Transmission of arteriviruses occurs via the respiratory route or via bodily fluids and in all cases their primary target cells are macrophages. The outcomes of infections with the different arteriviruses range from asymptomatic infections that can be either persistent or acute, to abortion, respiratory disease, arteritis, fatal hemorrhagic fever, and poliomyelitis. Mechanisms that are thought to contribute to persistence include masking of the primary neutralization epitope by glycosylation, the generation of neutralization escape variants, infection of macrophages by immune complexes via Fc receptors, and the presence of an immunodominant decoy epitope near the primary neutralizing epitope.","Brinton, M.A.; Snijder, E.J.",Encyclopedia of Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104005379; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104005379,196

We describe implementation at the first US site, the UPMC health system, and offer recommendations for implementation at other sites. METHODS: To implement REMAP-COVID, we focused on six major areas: engaging leadership, trial embedment, remote consent and enrollment, regulatory compliance, modification of traditional trial management procedures, and alignment with other COVID-19 studies. RESULTS: We recommend aligning institutional and trial goals and sharing a vision of REMAP-COVID implementation as groundwork for learning health system development. Embedment of trial procedures into routine care processes, existing institutional structures, and the electronic health record promotes efficiency and integration of clinical care and clinical research. Remote consent and enrollment can be facilitated by engaging bedside providers and leveraging institutional videoconferencing tools. Coordination with the central institutional review board will expedite the approval process. Protocol adherence, adverse event monitoring, and data collection and export can be facilitated by building electronic health record processes, though implementation can start using traditional clinical trial tools. Lastly, establishment of a centralized institutional process optimizes coordination of COVID-19 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the REMAP-COVID trial within a large US healthcare system is feasible and facilitated by multidisciplinary collaboration. This investment establishes important groundwork for future learning health system endeavors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02735707.

However, the extent of this effect requires further investigation. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long‐term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID‐19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3) from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015–2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID‐19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long‐term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long‐term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID‐19 patients. Air pollutants such as PM2.5 may assist with the prediction of CFR for COVID‐19 patients.","Hou, Chang‐kai; Qin, Ya‐fei; Wang, Grace; Liu, Quan‐lei; Yang, Xin‐yu; Wang, Hao",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470428/,196

Group testing offers a way to increase throughput by testing pools of combined samples; however, most proposed designs have not yet addressed key concerns over sensitivity loss and implementation feasibility. Here, we combined a mathematical model of epidemic spread and empirically derived viral kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 infections to identify pooling designs that are robust to changes in prevalence and to ratify sensitivity losses against the time course of individual infections. We show that prevalence can be accurately estimated across a broad range, from 0.02 to 20%, using only a few dozen pooled tests and using up to 400 times fewer tests than would be needed for individual identification. We then exhaustively evaluated the ability of different pooling designs to maximize the number of detected infections under various resource constraints, finding that simple pooling designs can identify up to 20 times as many true positives as individual testing with a given budget. Crucially, we confirmed that our theoretical results can be translated into practice using pooled human nasopharyngeal specimens by accurately estimating a 1% prevalence among 2304 samples using only 48 tests and through pooled sample identification in a panel of 960 samples. Our results show that accounting for variation in sampled viral loads provides a nuanced picture of how pooling affects sensitivity to detect infections. Using simple, practical group testing designs can vastly increase surveillance capabilities in resource-limited settings.","Cleary, Brian; Hay, James A.; Blumenstiel, Brendan; Harden, Maegan; Cipicchio, Michelle; Bezney, Jon; Simonton, Brooke; Hong, David; Senghore, Madikay; Sesay, Abdul K.; Gabriel, Stacey; Regev, Aviv; Mina, Michael J.",Sci Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abf1568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619080/,196

The International Society of Orthopaedic Centers (ISOC) is a consortium of academic orthopaedic centers whose members’ practices likely reflect contemporary evidence and indicate how orthopaedic surgery residents and fellows are trained. METHODS: We administered a 65 question, electronic survey of adult reconstruction surgeons across the ISOC centers in September 2020 to assess practice patterns. Results were assessed using descriptive statistics or by modeling the underlying response distribution, and the analysis was stratified by hospital region. RESULTS: 79 surgeons across 19 ISOC centers in 5 continents (Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America) completed the survey. Selected findings include: in total hip arthroplasty (THA), the posterolateral approach was used for 71 ± 42% of THA (mean ± standard deviation) and the direct anterior approach in 18% ± 34%. In total knee arthroplasty, posterior-stabilized (66% ± 39%) and cruciate-retaining (19 ± 33%) implants were most common. Robots were available in 56% (44 of 79) of surgeons’ centers more commonly in Asia, Australia, and North America. Tranexamic acid was routinely used in arthroplasty by 99% (78 of 79) of surgeons. Eighty-six percent (68 of 79) submit data to joint or other registries. Virtual visits were used for 13% ± 16% of outpatient visits and by 82% (64 of 79) of surgeons overall.

The global economy has changed dramatically during an extremely short period of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All levels of the economy and people’s behavior have been modified, and according to experts, these changes are almost irreversible. In this situation, there is a need not only to change the management system of all levels of economic systems, but also to transform education, especially Russian higher education system, due to the fact that now Russian education has two simultaneous tasks: to adapt to the changes that have occurred under the influence of the pandemic and to increase the prestige of Russian universities in the international educational space. Universal scientific methods were used in this research process, including comparative and factor analysis methods, synthesis, and generalization. Achievements: 1. In the article the current trends in the development of the Russian economy in the context of the pandemic and the entry of innovative technologies in all areas of economic relations were analyzed, which have an impact on the formation of new labor market demands. 2. The specific features and problematic aspects of the current system of Russian education, which are slowing down the processes of its transformation, are identified. 3.

657046,Mother and neonate suffering from COVID-19 infection. Is there any risk of vertical transmission? A case report.,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk–benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E.; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A.; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B.; Schild, Steven E.; Senan, Suresh; Simone II, Charles B.; Slotman, Ben J.; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S.; Palma, David",Radiother Oncol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167814020301821; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167814020301821; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342863/,196

658273,"A case of concomitant pulmonary embolism and pulmonary tuberculosis in the era of COVID 19, a matter of cautious approach",2021-03-24,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus infecting humans that is associated with acute pneumonia, occasional renal failure, and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health. The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-ΔE) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-ΔE genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells. The infectious virus was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the E protein in trans, indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective. Therefore, the rMERS-CoV-ΔE mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2012, it has already spread to 10 different countries, infecting around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50%. This article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, based on the construction of an infectious cDNA clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using this system, a collection of rMERS-CoV deletion mutants has been generated. Interestingly, one of the mutants with the E gene deleted was a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing E protein in trans, whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo. This virus constitutes a vaccine candidate that may represent a balance between safety and efficacy for the induction of mucosal immunity, which is needed to prevent MERS-CoV infection.","Almazán, Fernando; DeDiego, Marta L.; Sola, Isabel; Zuñiga, Sonia; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Marquez-Jurado, Silvia; Andrés, German; Enjuanes, Luis",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00650-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023385/,196

In this article, we propose that justice demands the improvement of what we call the ‘health agency’ of parents-to-be as part of a response to these poor outcomes. We take health agency to have three aspects: (i) the capacity to form health-goals one has reason to value, (ii) the control one perceives to have over achieving those health-goals and (iii) the freedom(s) one has to achieve those health-goals. We will moreover argue that this demand of justice can be best based on a perfectionist rather than neutralist method of justification. Subsequently, we will argue that perfectionist policy may be paternalistic but not wrongfully paternalistic. This leads us to conclude that perfectionism should be adopted to inform and justify public health policy that is aimed at improving health agency in general and counteracting poor pregnancy outcomes and inequalities in perinatal health outcomes in particular.","Ismaili M’hamdi, Hafez; de Beaufort, Inez",Public Health Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650620/; https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phab009,196

The vitamin D status of ethnic minority groups has been examined both in UK and European populations, but not in the Irish context. The aim of this study is to assess the vitamin D status from a selection of the Dublin population of South East Asian descent. A search was conducted, using the laboratory information system of St James’s Hospital, Dublin, for vitamin D requests by General practitioners. From 2013 to 2016, 186 participants were identified and 25(OH)D analysis was quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Overall, the median age was 32 years, 51% were male, and the 25(OH)D concentration ranged from 10 to 154 nmol/L. In total, 66.7% of the total sample were vitamin D deficient and 6.7% had a 25(OH)D status greater than 50 nmol/L (the 25(OH)D concentration defined by the EU as ‘sufficient’). Females had a significantly higher 25(OH)D concentration than males (25.0 vs. 18.0 nmol/L; p = 0.001) but both groups had a significant proportion with deficient status (56% and 76.8%, respectively). Seasonal variation of 25(OH)D was not evident while high rates of deficiency were also observed in those aged <18 years and >50 years. Given the importance of vitamin D for health, this sub-population could be at a significantly increased risk of rickets, impaired bone metabolism, and osteoporosis. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several non-bone related conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Currently, there is no unique vitamin D intake or vitamin D status maintenance guidelines recommended for adults of non-Irish descent; this needs to be considered by the relevant public health bodies in Ireland.","Laird, Eamon; Walsh, James Bernard; Lanham-New, Susan; O’Sullivan, Maria; Kenny, Rose Anne; Scully, Helena; Crowley, Vivion; Healy, Martin",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260572/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123674,196

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of influenza vaccinations among pediatric patients seen in U.S. health centers, and to explore potential disparities in vaccination coverage among subpopulations. Funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, these health centers provide primary and preventive care to underserved and vulnerable individuals and families in order to reduce health disparities based on economic, geographic, or cultural barriers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data, analyzed in 2019, came from the most recent waves of the Health Center Patient Survey (2009, 2014). The sample consisted of children ages 2–17 years receiving care from HRSA-funded health centers. The outcome of interest was self- or parent-reported receipt of influenza vaccine in the past year. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted prevalence rate ratios for the association between demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty level, urban/rural residence, geographic region), health-related variables (receipt of well-child check-up, asthma diagnosis), and influenza vaccination. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients increased from 46.6% in 2009 to 67.8% in 2014. In the adjusted model for 2014, there were few statistically significant differences in vaccination coverage among subpopulation groups, however American Indian/Alaska Native children had 31% increased vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic White children (aPRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02–1.60) and children living in the South had 26% decreased vaccination coverage compared with those living in the Northeast (aPRR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54–0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients in 2014 exceeded the national average (as of 2018–2019), and few differences were found among at-risk subpopulations. HRSA-funded health centers are well-positioned to further increase the vaccination rate among children living in underserved communities.","Lebrun-Harris, Lydie A.; Mendel Van Alstyne, Judith A.; Sripipatana, Alek",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713680/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20309348; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20309348; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.021,196

DESIGN: REDcap online‐based survey of hospital capacity. SETTING: UK secondary and tertiary hospitals providing head and neck cancer surgery. PARTICIPANTS: One representative per hospital was asked to report the capacity for head and neck cancer surgery in that institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The principal measures of interests were new patient referrals, capacity in outpatients, theatres and critical care; therapeutic compromises constituting delay to surgery, de‐escalated surgery and therapeutic migration to non‐surgical primary modality. RESULTS: Data were returned from approximately 95% of UK hospitals with a head and neck cancer surgery specialist service. 50% of UK head and neck cancer patients requiring surgery have significantly compromised treatments during the second wave: 28% delayed, 10% have received radiotherapy‐based treatment instead of surgery, and 12% have received de‐escalated surgery. Surgical capacity has been more severely constrained in the second wave (58% of pre‐pandemic level) compared with the first wave (62%) despite the time to prepare. CONCLUSIONS: Some hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID‐19 and unable to offer essential cancer surgery, but all have neighbouring hospitals in their region retaining good (or even normal) capacity. It is noteworthy that very few patients have been appropriately redirected away from the hospitals most constrained by their burden of COVID‐19. The paucity of an effective central or regional strategic response to this evident mismatch between demand and surgical capacity is to the detriment of our head and neck cancer patients.","Shaw, Richard",Clin Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660920/; https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13749,196

Spatial differences in access to food are mainly blamed as the cause for these nutritional inequalities. This study first detected hot and cold spots of food providers in West Virginia and then used those places in a quasi-experimental method (entropy balancing) to study the effects of those places on diabetes and obesity rates. We found that although hot spots have lower rates of chronic diseases than non-hot spots and cold spots have higher rates of chronic diseases than non-cold spots—the situation is complicated. With the findings of income induced chronic disease rates in urban areas, where most hot spots are located, there is evidence of another case for ""food swamps."" However, in cold spots which are located mainly in rural areas, higher rates of chronic diseases are attributed to a combination of access to food providers along with lacking the means (i.e., income for low-income households) to form healthier habits.","Kariburyo, Mohamed Shabani; Andress, Lauri; Collins, Alan; Kinder, Paul",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937778/,196

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need, and numerous compounds have already been selected for in vitro testing by several groups. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein, we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA-approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, lumefantrine, an antimalarial was selected for testing and showed limited antiviral activity in cell-based assays while demonstrating binding (Kd 259 nM) to the spike protein using microscale thermophoresis. Several other compounds which we prioritized have since been tested by others and were also found to be active in vitro. This combined machine learning and in vitro testing approach can be expanded to virtually screen available molecules with predicted activity against SARS-CoV-2 reference WIV04 strain and circulating variants of concern. In the process of this work, we have created multiple iterations of machine learning models that can be used as a prioritization tool for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug discovery programs.

The WHO guideline cites “high certainty” evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis does not reduce mortality and does not reduce hospital admission, and “moderate certainty” evidence of poor tolerability because of a significantly increased rate of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. Yet there is no such evidence. In the three pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis RCTs evaluated in the guideline there were no deaths and only two COVID-19-related hospital admissions, and there was a mistake in the analysis of the number of discontinuations (after correction there is no longer a statistically significant difference between those taking the drug and the controls). Guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 should be based on sufficient verified evidence, understanding of the disease process, sound statistical analysis and interpretation, and an appreciation of global needs.","Schilling, William HK; Callery, James J.; Chandna, Arjun; Hamers, Raph L; Watson, James A; White, Nicholas J",Wellcome Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395925/; https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16741.1,196
663943,Improvement of Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Pruritus After Treatment With Intravenous Naloxone.,2021-09-29,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 which was first reported in China is the cause of infection known as COVID-19. In comparison with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower but the transmissibility is higher. Immune dysregulation is the most common feature of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 that leads to hyperinflammation. Micronutrients such as zinc are essential for normal immune function. According to the assessment of WHO, approximately one-third of the world’s society suffer from zinc deficiency. Low plasma levels of zinc are associated with abnormal immune system functions such as impaired chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and phagocytosis, dysregulated intracellular killing, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, decreased antibody production, and sensitivity to microbes especially viral respiratory infections. Zinc exerts numerous direct and indirect effects against a wide variety of viral species particularly RNA viruses. The use of zinc and a combination of zinc-pyrithione at low concentrations impede SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Accordingly, zinc can inhibit the elongation step of RNA transcription. Furthermore, zinc might improve antiviral immunity by up-regulation of IFNα through JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in leukocytes. On the other hand, zinc supplementation might ameliorate tissue damage caused by mechanical ventilation in critical COVID-19 patients. Finally, zinc might be used in combination with antiviral medications for the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current review article, we review and discuss the immunobiological roles and antiviral properties as well as the therapeutic application of zinc in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses infections.","Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Nikfarjam, Sepideh; Majidi Zolbanin, Naime; Nassiri, Reza; Jafari, Reza",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921002666?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882442/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921002666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107630,196

While there are mRNA agents on the horizon as apotential prevention, adefinitive drug therapy is an unmet medical need. The hyperinflammatory response, known as the ‘cytokine storm’, is chiefly responsible for complications and deaths. The binding of spike-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR4 receptors has been documented in several studies and has been found to play arole in hyperinflammation; hence, there is an interest in TLR4 as apotential drug target. Areas covered: This review discusses the neurological and respiratory complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progresses to examine the role of the ‘cytokine storm’ and the involvement of TLR4 receptors in these complications. The possibility of using TLR4 modulators to curb the complications are considered and finally, ashort perspective on future potential drug treatments is offered. Various databases were searched including Pub-Med, Google Scholar, and Medline. The search mainly included research articles, meta-analysis, retrospective studies, reports, and systematic reviews.

Therefore, to reduce the transmission of this pathogen, several countries have taken many intervention measures. In this paper, we show that the impact of these measures in India is different from several other countries. It is shown that an early lockdown in late March 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of COVID-19 to a linear one, but a surge in the number of cases from late April 2020 brought India back to a quadratic trajectory. A regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states. It is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests, and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread. This insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for India nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions. Nonetheless, future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data, and a comparative study is presented. In the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections, these projections will have a limited accuracy: with that limitation, the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through September 2020.","Ranjan, R.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129197; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.12.20129197v1?rss=1,196
665725,Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak,2020-04-14,"Abstract Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We aimed to i) examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory virus infections a year previous; ii) compare current smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence; and iii) examine concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the medical notes. Methods: This retrospective case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. London smoking prevalence was obtained from the representative Annual Population Survey. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework. Findings: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had lower odds of being current smokers than patients admitted with other respiratory viruses (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). Odds were equivocal for former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Current smoking in cases was significantly lower than expected from London prevalence (9.4% vs. 12.9%, p=.02). Smoking status recorded on the EHR deviated significantly from that recorded within the medical notes ({chi}2(3)=226.7, p<.001).

667399,Commentary: Case Report: Hyperbilirubinemia in Gilbert Syndrome Attenuates Covid-19-Induced Metabolic Disturbances,2021-07-22,"Rationale: Patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have complex organ support needs that necessitate prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), likely to result in a high incidence of neuromuscular weakness and loss of well-being. Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations. Objectives: To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation, and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Adults admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for >24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score to identify the time taken to first mobilize (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge. Results: A total of n = 177 patients were identified, of whom n = 110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. While on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19 ± 10 d), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The mean ± standard deviation time to first mobilize was 14 ± 7 days, with a median Manchester Mobility Score at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4–6), which represents participants able to stand and step around to a chair with or without assistance. Time to mobilize was significantly longer in those with higher body mass index (P < 0.001), and older patients (P = 0.012) and those with more comorbidities (P = 0.017) were more likely to require further rehabilitation after discharge. Conclusions: The early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom resembles the experience in other countries, with high acuity of illness and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation required for those patients admitted to the ICU. Although the time to commence rehabilitation was delayed owing to this severity of illness, rehabilitation was possible within the ICU and led to increased levels of mobility from waking before ICU discharge.

In an attempt to address this we used a rapidly growing genomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with relevant metadata information. Remarkably, by simply ordering SARS-CoV-2 genomes by their date of collection, we find a progressive increase of C-to-U substitutions resulting in 5'-UCG-3' motif reduction that in turn have reduced the CpG frequency over just a few months of observation.

670711,Therapeutic approach for severe COVID-19 and immunocompromised patients. A case series,2021-03-24,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a robust framework for the assessment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in businesses, using the construction industry as an example and with the primary focus on combating climate change (SDG 13). We provide a critical analysis of a selection of relatively widely used SDG impact assessment tools, combined with a case study from the construction industry to explore how a meaningful SDG assessment can be framed with linkages between SDG 13 and other related SDGs. Our analysis points towards the importance of framing SDG assessments in a way that discourages “Greenwashing”. Any SDG assessment that relates to climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement should identify the processes and activities that can be expected to be particularly challenging in terms of their abatement. In our road construction work case, we identify four such hard-to-abate activities: 1) introducing biomass for renewable transportation fuels for use in construction equipment and heavy transport; 2) electrification of transport and industrial processes; 3) substitution as part of transitioning from fossil fuel use; and 4) applying carbon capture and storage technologies in the production of basic materials, such as cement and steel. The approach applied will avoid that businesses only focus on SDGs in situations where they are already performing well or can apply low-cost measures or that they only relate to the part of the supply chain that pertains to their own business (Scope 1 emissions). For an SDG assessment to provide basis for informed decisions regarding real change towards more sustainable and equitable corporate practices it should: (i) identify and include concrete measures to align with the terms of the Paris Agreement; (ii) include relevant value chains; and (iii) consider both the short-term and long-term effects of strategic choices.","Johnsson, Filip; Karlsson, Ida; Rootzén, Johan; Ahlbäck, Anders; Gustavsson, Mathias",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120303208; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.110029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234615/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120303208,196

Infection induced by various respiratory viruses may lead to thrombotic complications. Infection-elicited thrombosis may involve a repertoire of distinct, yet interconnected pathophysiological mechanisms, implicating a hyperinflammatory response, platelet activation and triggering of the coagulation cascade. In the present review, we present current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie thrombotic complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we provide clinical data regarding the incidence rate of thrombotic events in several viral respiratory infections that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and finally we summarize current recommendations concerning thromboprophylaxis and antithrombotic therapy in patients with thrombotic complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Moschonas, Iraklis C.; Tselepis, Alexandros D.",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02374-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449290/,196

Methods This retrospective, single-center study included 595 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from February 26, 2020 to March 26, 2020. Demographic data, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected and compared between patients based on diabetes status. Complications and clinical outcomes were followed up until April 4, 2020. Results From among the 595 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55 years and 401 (67.4%) were male. The most common symptoms included fever (419 [70.4%]), dry cough (368 [61.8%]) and dyspnea (363 [61%]). A total of 148 patients (24.9%) had diabetes, and compared with patients without diabetes, these patients had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension [48.6% vs. 22.3%; P <.001]); had higher levels of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood urea nitrogen, and had a higher proportion of patchy ground-glass opacity in chest computed tomography findings (52.7% vs. 25.7%; P <.001). Significantly, patients with diabetes had more complications and needed more respiratory support than those without diabetes (P <.001). At the end of the follow-up, treatment failure and death was significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (17.8% vs. 8.7%; P = 0.003). Conclusion COVID-19 patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of complications and a higher in-hospital mortality during hospitalization. Diabetes status of COVID-19 patients and frequent monitoring of glycemia would be helpful to prevent deteriorating clinical conditions.","Akbariqomi, Mostafa; Sadat Hosseini, Mahboobeh; Rashidiani, Jamal; Sedighian, Hamid; Biganeh, Hossein; Heidari, Reza; Moosazadeh Moghaddam, Mehrdad; Farnoosh, Gholamreza; Kooshki, Hamid",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979419/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720307208; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720307208?v=s5,196
672348,Sinomaxillary mucormycosis an increasingly common occurrence in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-06,"The Covid-19 pandemic led to threatening shortages in healthcare of medical products such as face masks. Due to this major impact on our healthcare society an initiative was conducted between March and July 2020 for reprocessing of face masks from 19 different hospitals. This exceptional opportunity was used to study the costs impact and the carbon footprint of reprocessed face masks relative to new disposable face masks. The aim of this study is to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess and compare the climate change impact of disposed versus reprocessed face masks. In total 18.166 high quality medical FFP2 face masks were reprocessed through steam sterilization between March and July 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions during production, transport, sterilization and end-of-life processes were assessed. The background life cycle inventory data were retrieved from the ecoinvent database. The life cycle impact assessment method ReCiPe was used to translate emissions into climate change impact. The cost analysis is based on actual sterilization as well as associated costs compared to the prices of new disposable face masks. A Monte Carlo sampling was used to propagate the uncertainty of different inputs to the LCA results. The carbon footprint appears to be 58% lower for face masks which were reused for five times compared to new face masks which were used for one time only. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the loading capacity of the autoclave and rejection rate of face masks has a large influence on the carbon footprint. The estimated cost price of a reprocessed mask was €1.40 against €1.55. The Life Cycle Assessment demonstrates that reprocessed FFP2 face masks from a circular economy perspective have a lower climate change impact on the carbon footprint than new face masks. For policymakers it is important to realize that the carbon footprint of medical products such as face masks may be reduced by means of circular economy strategies. This study demonstrated a lower climate change impact and lower costs when reprocessing and reusing disposable face masks for five times. Therefore, this study may serve as an inspiration for investigating reprocessing of other medical products that may become scarce. Finally, this study advocates that circular design engineering principles should be taken into account when designing medical devices. This will lead to more sustainable products that have a lower carbon footprint and may be manufactured at lower costs.","van Straten, Bart; Ligtelijn, S.; Droog, L.; Putman, E.; Dankelman, J.; Weiland, N.

672456,The Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter National Retrospective Cohort,2021-01-23,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has an RNA genome, which is, overall, closely related to the bat coronavirus sequence RaTG13. However, the ACE2-binding domain of this virus is more similar to a coronavirus isolated from a Guangdong pangolin. In addition to this unique feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content. This has been postulated to be the signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host antiviral protein ZAP. Here, we analyzed the sequences of a wide range of viruses using both alignment-based and alignment free approaches to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our analyses revealed a high level of similarity between the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and that of the Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. This suggests bat and pangolin coronaviruses might have recombined at least twice (in the 5’UTR and ACE2 binding regions) to seed the formation of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative hypothesis is that the lineage preceding SARS-CoV-2 is a yet to be sampled bat coronavirus whose ACE2 binding domain and 5’UTR are distinct from other known bat coronaviruses. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of viral genome compositions as well as expression and RNA binding data of ZAP to show that the low CpG abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is not related to an evolutionary pressure from ZAP.","Afrasiabi, Ali; Alinejad-Rokny, Hamid; Lovell, Nigel; Xu, Zhenming; Ebrahimi, Diako",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.23.351353,196

To date, there is no evidence of a higher incidence of COVID in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases and we support the approach of maintaining chronic rheumatological treatments. However, once infected there is a small but significant increased risk of mortality. Among the different treatments, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of complications, but data for other drugs are conflicting or incomplete. The use of certain drugs for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms appears to be a potentially interesting options for the treatment. The rationale for their use is based on the immune system runaway and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il1, IL6, TNFα) in severe forms of the disease. Notably, patients on chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for their autoimmune rheumatic disease are not protected from COVID-19.","Grange, Lucile; Guilpain, Philippe; Truchetet, Marie-Elise; Cracowski, Jean-Luc",Therapie,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720301189?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665090/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720301189; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.013,196

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China using a 37-item questionnaire developed based on previous research. A professional online survey tool (www.wjx.cn) and a social media platform (WeChat) were used to display and distribute the questionnaire. Data were collected during April 11 to 13, 2020, when most regions of China had resumed dental practice except for high-risk regions such as Wuhan. Then the data were analyzed with multivariable generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 2,669 valid questionnaires were collected. Orthodontic services were suspended for nearly all respondents (97.8%) during the epidemic, and 68.0% had resumed work by the time they completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (80.2%) were confident that they understood COVID-19 related knowledge, but most of them only correctly answered less than half of the questions testing their actual level of knowledge. About two-thirds (64.1%) were willing to treat/care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

Molecular mimicry, the cross‐activation of autoreactive T cells by mimic peptides from infectious agents, is a possible explanation for infection‐induced autoimmunity. Infection of mice with a non‐pathogenic strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) engineered to express an epitope from Haemophilus influenzae (HI) sharing 6/13 amino acids with the dominant proteolipid protein (PLP) epitope, PLP(139–151), can induce CNS autoimmune disease. Here we demonstrate that another PLP(139–151) mimic sequence derived from murine hepatitis virus (MHV) which shares only 3/13 amino acids with PLP(139–151) can also induce CNS autoimmune disease, but only when delivered by genetically engineered TMEV, not by immunization with the MHV peptide. Further, we demonstrate the importance of proline at the secondary MHC class II contact residue for effective cross‐reactivity, as addition of this amino acid to the native MHV sequence increases its ability to cross‐activate PLP(139–151)‐specific autoreactive T cells, while substitution of proline in the HI mimic peptide has the opposite effect. This study describes a structural requirement for potential PLP(139–151) mimic peptides, and provides further evidence for infection‐induced molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.","Croxford, J.

Strengthened HIS enable prompt case detection and effective response to halt disease transmission and prevent probable outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the importance and feasibility of implementing recommendations for improving surveillance core functions, support functions and surveillance attributes concerning PC-NTDs in Kenya. METHODS: A descriptive web-based Delphi process comprising of two survey rounds was used to achieve group consensus on the importance of recommended actions and feasibility of their implementation. In the first round, participants were enrolled to complete a five-point likert-type self-administered electronic questionnaire comprising of 60 statements across 12 sub-domains on the importance of recommendations. In the second round, participants reappraised their responses following completion of a questionnaire with 56 rephrased statements on feasibility of implementing the recommendations to improve PC-NTDs surveillance and response. Data from both rounds were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis performed for the open-ended responses. RESULTS: Sixty-two key stakeholders actively involved in surveillance and response activities in seven PC-NTDs endemic counties in Kenya were invited to participate. Of these, 50/62 completed the first round (81 % response rate) and 45/50 completed the second round (90 % response rate). Consensus was achieved (defined as > 70 % agreement) on the importance (93 %) of recommendation statements and feasibility (82 %) of implementing the important recommendations. Stakeholders agreed on the importance and feasibility of specific recommendations across the 12 sub-domains: case detection and registration, reporting, data analysis, feedback, epidemic preparedness and response, supervision, training, resources, simplicity, acceptability, stability and flexibility. However, there was lack of consensus on the feasibility of conducting routine data analysis, increasing supervision of surveillance activities at lower levels and retaining trained surveillance staff across all levels.

679686,Clinical dilemma of DKA and Covid-19 infection: A case report,2020-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a common problem and is associated with high costs, including those related to health care and indirect costs due to absence at work or reduced productivity. Previous studies have demonstrated that acupuncture or electroacupuncture can relieve low back pain. Electronic acupuncture shoes (EAS) are a novel device designed in this study. This device combines the properties of acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for clinical use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of EAS in patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: In this prospective double-blinded randomized controlled study, the data of 83 patients who experienced chronic low back pain were analyzed. Patients came to our clinic for 20 visits and underwent assessment and treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either EAS plus placebo nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (EAS group, n=42) or sham EAS plus NSAIDs (NSAID group, n=41). The visual analog scale (VAS) score and range of motion were assessed at baseline, before and after each EAS treatment, and 2 weeks after the last treatment. The time for achieving pain remission was recorded. Quality of life was assessed at the 2nd, 14th, and 20th visits. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of treatment, the treatment success rate in each visit in the EAS group was higher than that in the NSAID group, as revealed by the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, but significant differences were observed only during the 16th visit in the ITT analysis (EAS group: 31/37, 84% and NSAID group: 21/34, 62%; P=.04). The change in the VAS score from baseline in each visit in the EAS group was greater than that in the NSAID group, as revealed by the ITT and PP analyses, and significant differences were observed in the 5th visit and 9th visit in the ITT analysis (P=.048 and P=.048, respectively). Significant differences were observed in the left rotation in the 2nd visit and 4th visit (P=.049 and P=.03, respectively).

680559,2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in hemodialysis patients: a report of two cases,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: A number of community based surveys have identified an increase in psychological symptoms and distress but there has been no examination of symptoms at the more severe end of the mental health spectrum. AIMS: We aimed to analyse numbers and types of psychiatric presentations to inform planning for future demand on mental health services in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We analysed electronic data between January and April 2020 for 2534 patients referred to acute psychiatric services, and tested for differences in patient demographics, symptom severity and use of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA), before and after lockdown. We used interrupted time-series analyses to compare trends in emergency department and psychiatric presentations until December 2020. RESULTS: There were 22% fewer psychiatric presentations the first week and 48% fewer emergency department presentations in the first month after lockdown initiated. A higher proportion of patients were detained under the MHA (22.2 v. 16.1%) and Mental Capacity Act 2005 (2.2 v. 1.1%) (χ(2)(2) = 16.3, P < 0.0001), and they experienced a longer duration of symptoms before seeking help from mental health services (χ(2)(3) = 18.6, P < 0.0001). A higher proportion of patients presented with psychotic symptoms (23.3 v. 17.0%) or delirium (7.0 v. 3.6%), and fewer had self-harm behaviour (43.8 v. 52.0%, χ(2)(7) = 28.7, P < 0.0001). A higher proportion were admitted to psychiatric in-patient units (22.2 v. 18.3%) (χ(2)(6) = 42.8, P < 0.0001) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: UK lockdown resulted in fewer psychiatric presentations, but those who presented were more likely to have severe symptoms, be detained under the MHA and be admitted to hospital. Psychiatric services should ensure provision of care for these patients as well as planning for those affected by future COVID-19 waves.","Mukadam, Naaheed; Sommerlad, Andrew; Wright, Jessica; Smith, Abigail; Szczap, Aleksandra; Solomou, Solomis; Bhome, Rohan; Thayalan, Roshan; Abrol, Esha; Aref-Adib, Golnar; Maconick, Lucy; Aubrey-Jones, Dominic; Tugrul, Senem; Knowles, Melanie; Menys, Helen; Sathanandan, Shivanthi; Moslehi, Sarah; Huntley, Jonathan; Liu, Kathy; Carlos Bazo-Alvarez, Juan",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266510/,196

Here, we show that CC40.8 targets the conserved S2 stem-helix region of the coronavirus spike fusion machinery. We determined a crystal structure of CC40.8 Fab with a SARS-CoV-2 S2 stem-peptide at 1.6 Å resolution and found that the peptide adopts a mainly helical structure. Conserved residues in β-CoVs interact with the antibody, thereby providing a molecular basis for its broad reactivity. CC40.8 exhibits in vivo protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a hamster model with reduction in weight loss and lung viral titers. Furthermore, we noted CC40.8-like bnAbs are relatively rare in human COVID-19 infection and therefore their elicitation may require rational vaccine strategies. Overall, our study describes a new target on CoV spikes for protective antibodies that may facilitate the development of pan-β-CoV vaccines.

Simultaneously, in Italy, in which the first case had occurred on February 18, the rigid phase of the lockdown began. The country has attracted worldwide attention, becoming at the same time a field of study both concerning the spread of the pandemic and advanced assessments of the effectiveness of political, public health, and therapeutic measures. The protagonists of the Italian crisis were the healthcare workers (HCWs) who were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without having any perception of what they were facing, courageously contributing to the containment of the epidemic to be defined by the media as “heroes.” However, in the first phase of the pandemic (March–May 2020), the price that the Italian Public Health System had to pay both in terms of the number of positive virus cases and deaths among the HCWs was beyond and represented a peculiarity compared to what happened in other countries. In the current study, after a summary of the evolution of the pandemic in Italy, we offer an analysis of the statistical data concerning contagions and deaths among healthcare workers (physicians in particular).

Since immunity against M. leprae is characterized by humoral and cellular markers, we developed a lateral flow test measuring multiple host proteins based on six previously identified biomarkers for various leprosy phenotypes. This multi-biomarker test (MBT) demonstrated feasibility of quantitative detection of six host serum proteins simultaneously, jointly allowing discrimination of patients with multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy from control individuals in high and low leprosy endemic areas. Pilot testing of fingerstick blood showed similar MBT performance in point-of-care (POC) settings as observed for plasma and serum. Thus, this newly developed prototype MBT measures six biomarkers covering immunity against M. leprae across the leprosy spectrum. The MBT thereby provides the basis for immunodiagnostic POC tests for leprosy with potential for other (infectious) diseases as well.","van Hooij, Anouk; Tjon Kon Fat, Elisa M.; de Jong, Danielle; Khatun, Marufa; Soren, Santosh; Chowdhury, Abu Sufian; Chandra Roy, Johan; Alam, Khorshed; Kim, Jong-Pill; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Geluk, Annemieke; Corstjens, Paul L.A.M.",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490914/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.102006,196

They are associated with mortality, hospitalization, substantial extra costs and lower patient’s quality of life. Thus, this study aimed to assess the community’s knowledge of COVID-19 and associated factors in Mizan-Aman town, southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among the community of Mizan-Aman from April 14 to May 14, 2020. A systematic sampling technique was used to collect data from selected households. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.0.2.101 and then exported to SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. To identify the predictors of knowledge of COVID-19, multiple backward logistic regression analysis was used. To show the accuracy of data analysis, 95% CI was used, and statistical significance was considered at p <0.05. RESULTS: From 423 sampled population, 393 (92.9%) of them responded to the questionnaire. Of these, 233 (59.3%) were male, 225 (57.3%) were 18–34 years old, and 250 (63.6%) were married. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 74.75%. More than 85% of respondents were well aware of the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19, its transmission by close contact, its prevention by not going to crowded places and isolation of infected persons. Male gender (AOR=3.74, CI: 1.87–7.49), age (35–54 years) (AOR=3.81, CI: 1.35–10.70), age ≥55 (AOR=2.97, CI: 1.16–7.62), lack of formal education (AOR=6.0, CI: 1.54–23.40), farmer (AOR=8.72, CI: 2.08–35.53), daily laborer (AOR=7.57, CI: 2.28–25.15), merchant (AOR=6.34, CI: 2.06–19.43), house wife (AOR=11.59, CI: 2.91–46.23) were significantly associated with poor knowledge, whereas single marital status was less likely associated with poor knowledge of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: One-third of the study participants had poor knowledge regarding COVID-19. Male gender, age above thirty-five years, lack of formal education, being farmer, daily laborer, merchant and house wife were significantly associated with poor knowledge.

However, early mortality of COVID19 in cancer patients has not been compared to historical real-world data from oncology population in pre-pandemic times. Methods: Longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclínicas Group in Brazil from March to December 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. As historical control, we selected patients from Oncoclínicas Data Lake treated before December 2019 and propensity score-matched to COVID-19 cases (3:1) based on the following clinical characteristics: age, gender, tumor type, disease setting (curative or palliative), time from diagnosis of cancer (or metastatic disease) to COVID-19 infection. Results: In total, 533 cancer patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, with median age 60 years, 67% females, most frequent tumor types breast (34%), hematological (16%), gastrointestinal (15%), genitourinary (12%) and respiratory tract malignancies (10%). Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (84%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (55%). In the overall population, early death rate was 15%, which was numerically higher than the Brazilian general population with COVID-19 diagnosis in 2020 (2.5%). We were able to match 442 cancer patients with COVID-19 to 1,187 controls with cancer from pre-pandemic times. The 30-day mortality rate was 12.4% in COVID-19 cases as compared to 5.4% in pre-pandemic controls with cancer (Odds Ratio 2.49, 95%CI 1.67 - 3.70;P value < 0.01, Power 97.5%). COVID-19 cancer patients had significantly higher death events than historical controls (Hazard Ratio 2.18, 95%CI 1.52 - 3.12;P value < 0.01, Power 99.7%), particularly from 20 to 30 days after diagnosis of the infection. Conclusions: Cancer patients with COVID-19 have an excess mortality 30 days after the infection when compared to matched cancer population from pre-pandemic times and the general population with COVID-19, reinforcing the need for priority vaccination in public health strategies.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID‐19 has placed the global health system under threat, which seriously influences the normal operations of human society. Safe and effective nursing measures should be taken to ensure the normal operation of dental clinics. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: We searched and referenced many references on the PubMed database. Through the combination of related literatures and our experience, we describe various strategies, including personnel management, personal protection, disinfection and isolation, adopted in the dental clinic of our Chinese hospital during the pandemic of COVID‐19. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: We introduced strategies for the nursing staff in dental clinics to assist them with the prevention and control of COVID‐19. The successful implementation of the protective measures could ensure the safety of medical staff and patients, and contributed to the normal operation of dental clinics during the pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: During the pandemic, frontline nurses are under physical and mental pressure facing the threat of infection while at work. In addition to pandemic prevention, we should also pay attention to the needs of nursing staff. More reasonable and effective nursing and health policies should be formulated to ensure their safety and protect their rights and interests.

Nevertheless, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with intravenous (i.v.) biologics had to move to hospitals for drug infusion. We investigated the impact of hospitalisation in patients with IBD. We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients initially in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics at the end of the first lockdown period. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at hospital for i.v.-treated patients or at home for patients treated with s.c. drugs. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 12 questions, specifically related to COVID-19 and its implications. A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. No relapses were recorded in either group (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, p = ns), as well as which, COVID-19 infections were not demonstrated in patients in contact with people with suspected symptoms or directly experiencing them. The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1 ± 2.8 vs. 37.2 ± 2.8; p = 0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n = 17), the rate of satisfaction with telemedicine (58.8%) was significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8%; p < 0.0005). Our results suggest that hospitalisation during the COVID-19 outbreak does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection as well as the risk of IBD relapse; moreover, the similar levels of anxiety in both groups could confirm that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy.","Bertani, Lorenzo; Barberio, Brigida; Tricò, Domenico; Zanzi, Federico; Maniero, Daria; Ceccarelli, Linda; Marsilio, Ilaria; Coppini, Francesca; Lorenzon, Greta; Mumolo, Maria Gloria; Zingone, Fabiana; Costa, Francesco; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362053/,196

The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human–animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human–animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.","Gray, Gregory C.; Robie, Emily R.; Studstill, Caleb J.; Nunn, Charles L.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917745/,196

Previously, electron microscopy was used to detect the presence of enteric viruses, which were identified solely on the basis of their morphology. With the advent of rapid molecular diagnostic methods and next generation nucleic acid sequencing, researchers have made long strides in identification and characterization of viruses associated with PEC. The molecular techniques have also helped us in identification of pathogens which were previously not known. Regional and national surveys have revealed the presence of several different enteric viruses in PEC including rotavirus, astrovirus, reovirus and coronavirus either alone or in combination.
