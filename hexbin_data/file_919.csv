The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to generate mild as well as critical courses. Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac, and kidney injury as well as shock. Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients.","Bemtgen, Xavier; Krüger, Kirsten; Supady, Alexander; Duerschmied, Daniel; Schibilsky, David; Bamberg, Fabian; Bode, Christoph; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid L",ASAIO journal,919,0

METHODS In this European, multicenter, parallel-group, blinded trial, we randomly assigned adults who had been admitted to the ICU for an acute condition (i.e., an unplanned admission) and who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding to receive 40 mg of intravenous pantoprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor) or placebo daily during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was death by 90 days after randomization. RESULTS A total of 3298 patients were enrolled; 1645 were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole group and 1653 to the placebo group. Data on the primary outcome were available for 3282 patients (99.5%). At 90 days, 510 patients (31.1%) in the pantoprazole group and 499 (30.4%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.13; P=0.76). During the ICU stay, at least one clinically important event (a composite of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, or myocardial ischemia) had occurred in 21.9% of patients assigned to pantoprazole and 22.6% of those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.11). In the pantoprazole group, 2.5% of patients had clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, as compared with 4.2% in the placebo group. The number of patients with infections or serious adverse reactions and the percentage of days alive without life support within 90 days were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Among adult patients in the ICU who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, mortality at 90 days and the number of clinically important events were similar in those assigned to pantoprazole and those assigned to placebo.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extracorporeal endotoxin removal by Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP), in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and secondary bacterial infection. We conducted a subgroup analysis of a multicenter, multinational, prospective, and observational web-based database (EUPHAS2 registry). We included 12 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from nasal/oral swab, admitted to the intensive care unit between February and May 2020, who were affected by septic shock and received PMX-HP as per clinical indication of the attending physician. Septic shock was diagnosed in nine patients (75%), with a median time between symptoms onset and PMX-HP treatment of 16 (14-22) days. We identified Gram-negative bacteria in most of the microbiological cultures (N = 17, 65%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria in (N = 4, 15%), fungi (N = 3, 12%) and no growth (N = 2, 8%). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score progressively improved over the next 120 hours following PMX-HP and it was associated with median endotoxin activity assay (EAA) decrease from 0.78 [0.70-0.92] at T0 to 0.60 [0.44-0.72] at T120 (P = .245). A direct correlation was observed between SOFA score and EAA. Lung Injury Score decreased and was associated with hemodynamic improvement over the same period. No statistically significant difference was observed for RIFLE score at each time point. Nine out of 12 patients (75%) required continuous renal replacement therapy because of acute kidney injury. In a series of consecutive COVID-19 patients with endotoxic shock, PMX-HP was associated with organ function recovery, hemodynamic improvement, and contemporary EAA level reduction. No PMX-HP-related complications were observed.","De Rosa, Silvia; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Ferrer, Ricard; Antonelli, Massimo; Ronco, Claudio",Artif. organs,919,26
