94,Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS): review of common infectious manifestations and treatment options,2007-05-08,"The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) results from restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens. A paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a new condition after initiating therapy characterizes the syndrome. Potential mechanisms for the syndrome include a partial recovery of the immune system or exuberant host immunological responses to antigenic stimuli. The overall incidence of IRIS is unknown, but is dependent on the population studied and its underlying opportunistic infectious burden. The infectious pathogens most frequently implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria, varicella zoster, herpesviruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). No single treatment option exists and depends on the underlying infectious agent and its clinical presentation. Prospective cohort studies addressing the optimal screening and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients eligible for ART are currently being conducted. These studies will provide evidence for the development of treatment guidelines in order to reduce the burden of IRIS. We review the available literature on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of IRIS, and present treatment options for the more common infectious manifestations of this diverse syndrome and for manifestations associated with a high morbidity.","Murdoch, David M; Venter, Willem DF; Van Rie, Annelies; Feldman, Charles",AIDS Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1871602/,67
325,"Let the sun shine in: effects of ultraviolet radiation on invasive pneumococcal disease risk in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2009-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia and bacteremia. Excess wintertime mortality related to pneumonia has been noted for over a century, but the seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been described relatively recently and is poorly understood. Improved understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality has taken on new urgency due to global climate change. METHODS: We evaluated 602 cases of IPD reported in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, from 2002 to 2007. Poisson regression models incorporating seasonal smoothers were used to identify associations between weekly weather patterns and case counts. Associations between acute (day-to-day) environmental fluctuations and IPD occurrence were evaluated using a case-crossover approach. Effect modification across age and sex strata was explored, and meta-regression models were created using stratum-specific estimates for effect. RESULTS: IPD incidence was greatest in the wintertime, and spectral decomposition revealed a peak at 51.0 weeks, consistent with annual periodicity. After adjustment for seasonality, yearly increases in reporting, and temperature, weekly incidence was found to be associated with clear-sky UV index (IRR per unit increase in index: 0.70 [95% CI 0.54-0.91]). The effect of UV index was highest among young strata and decreased with age. At shorter time scales, only an association with increases in ambient sulphur oxides was linked to disease risk (OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the wintertime predominance of IPD in a major urban center. The major predictor of IPD in Philadelphia is extended periods of low UV radiation, which may explain observed wintertime seasonality. The mechanism of action of diminished light exposure on disease occurrence may be due to direct effects on pathogen survival or host immune function via altered 1,25-(OH)(2)-vitamin-D metabolism. These findings may suggest less diminution in future IPD risk with climate change than would be expected if wintertime seasonality was driven by temperature.","White, Alexander NJ; Ng, Victoria; Spain, C Victor; Johnson, Caroline C; Kinlin, Laura M; Fisman, David N",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797517/,67
6121,Complications of plasma exchange in patients with neurological diseases,1990-12-01,"Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABS) are among the most frequent causes of bacterial infections during childhood. In addition to well-known local infections, scarlet fever, and sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF) have been noted with increasing frequency.NF can also be induced in children by superinfected varicella, which is associated with a higher mortality rate.Triggering factors include pathogen-specific capsular proteins, virulent factors, and toxins as superantigens. Immunological quick tests display high reliability, and PCR enables analyses of types and toxins.Furthermore, type-specific streptococcal sequelae can be caused by group C streptococci.Rheumatic fever is rather rare in industrialized nations, but cardiac involvement accurs more frequent than previously assumed.Chorea apparently correlates with neuronal antibodies, as do pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS),and a series of cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) associated with streptococci have also been reported. No resistance to penicillin exists, but pathogenic persistence remains a problem.A 26-M valent vaccine is in clinical trials, but is still subject to controversy.","Keitzer, R.",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096022/,67

In this regard, we have previously shown that immunogenicity of vaccine antigens can be improved by targeting the antigens to the antigen-presenting cells. Specifically, groups of mice immunized intranasally with a fusion protein (Bivalent-FP) containing a fragment of pneumococcal-surface-protein-A (PspA) as antigen and a single-chain bivalent antibody raised against the anti-human Fc-gamma-receptor-I (hFcγRI) elicited protective immunity to pulmonary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. In order to further enhance the immunogenicity, an additional hFcγRI-binding moiety of the single chain antibody was incorporated. The modified vaccine (Trivalent-FP) induced significantly improved protection against lethal pulmonary S. pneumoniae challenge compared to Bivalent-FP. In addition, the modified vaccine exhibited over 85% protection with only two immunizations. Trivalent-FP also induced S. pneumoniae-specific systemic and mucosal antibodies. Moreover, Trivalent-FP also induced IL-17- and IL-22-producing CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, it was found that the hFcγRI facilitated uptake and presentation of Trivalent-FP. In addition, Trivalent-FP also induced IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNF-α; modulated recruitment of dendritic cells and macrophages; and induced CD80/86 and MHC-II expression on antigen presenting cells.","Kumar, Sudeep; Sunagar, Raju; Gosselin, Edmund J.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349865/,67

21530,A case report of endometrial adenocarcinoma with leptomeningeal metastases,2021-09-21,"[Image: see text] Thermal drawing has been recently leveraged to yield multifunctional, fiber-based neural probes at near kilometer length scales. Despite its promise, the widespread adoption of this approach has been impeded by (1) material compatibility requirements and (2) labor-intensive interfacing of functional features to external hardware. Furthermore, in multifunctional fibers, significant volume is occupied by passive polymer cladding that so far has only served structural or electrical insulation purposes. In this article, we report a rapid, robust, and modular approach to creating multifunctional fiber-based neural interfaces using a solvent evaporation or entrapment-driven (SEED) integration process. This process brings together electrical, optical, and microfluidic modalities all encased within a copolymer comprised of water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) tethered to water-insoluble poly(urethane) (PU-PEG). We employ these devices for simultaneous optogenetics and electrophysiology and demonstrate that multifunctional neural probes can be used to deliver cellular cargo with high viability. Upon exposure to water, PU-PEG cladding spontaneously forms a hydrogel, which in addition to enabling integration of modalities, can harbor small molecules and nanomaterials that can be released into local tissue following implantation. We also synthesized a custom nanodroplet forming block polymer and demonstrated that embedding such materials within the hydrogel cladding of our probes enables delivery of hydrophobic small molecules in vitro and in vivo. Our approach widens the chemical toolbox and expands the capabilities of multifunctional neural interfaces.","Tabet, Anthony; Antonini, Marc-Joseph; Sahasrabudhe, Atharva; Park, Jimin; Rosenfeld, Dekel; Koehler, Florian; Yuk, Hyunwoo; Hanson, Samuel; Stinson, Jordan; Stok, Melissa; Zhao, Xuanhe; Wang, Chun; Anikeeva, Polina",ACS Cent Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8461769/,67

After comprehensive treatment, the patient was successfully treated and survived for a long time. CONCLUSIONS: There is a low successful clinical treatment rate for patients with pneumonia, pyopneumothorax with severe ARDS and septic shock. The successful treatment of this patient benefited from early and effective empirical therapy, targeted drug selection in the later stage, adequate closed thoracic drainage, repeated bronchial lavage, early CRRT, an appropriate respiratory support mode and parameter setting, immunotherapy and nutritional support therapy.

43911,465. Risk Factors Associated with Critical COVID-19 Requiring Mechanical Ventilation,2020-12-31,"Over the past four decades, China’s extensive economic growth mode has led to substantial greenhouse gas emissions, and China has become the world’s largest emitter since 2009. In order to alleviate the dual pressures from international climate negotiations and domestic environmental degradation, the Chinese government has pronounced it will reach its emission peak before 2030. However, through analyzing 12 scenarios, we found that it will be very difficult to meet this ambitious goal under the current widely used policies. With the trial implementation of China’s carbon emission trading system (ETS), concerns arise over whether national ETS can accelerate the carbon peak process. In this paper, we propose a new proactive data envelopment analysis approach to investigate the impacts of national carbon ETS on carbon peak. Several important results are obtained. For example, we find that carbon ETS has a significant accelerating effect on carbon peak, which effect will advance the carbon peak by one to 2 years, and the corresponding peak values are reduced by 2.71–3 Gt. In addition, the setting of carbon price in the current Chinese pilot carbon market is found to be overly conservative. Last, our estimation on the carbon trading volume indicates that the ETS lacks vitality as the annual average carbon trading volume only represents approximately 4.3% of the total average carbon emissions. Based on these findings, several policy implications are suggested regarding the means by which China can more smoothly peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and implement national carbon ETS.","Wu, Liangpeng; Zhu, Qingyuan",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778728/,67

The Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans’ Health Attitudes and Information Seeking Behavior,2020-12-31,"Social networks are the rich sources to people for sharing the knowledge on health-related issues. Nowadays, Twitter is one of the great significant social platforms to the people for a discussion on topics. Analyzing the clusters for the tweets concerning terms is a complex process due to the sparsity problem. Topic models are useful or avoiding this problem with derivations of topic clusters. Finding pre-cluster tendency is the major problem in many clustering methods. Existing methods, such as visual access tendency (VAT), cosine-based VAT (cVAT), multi viewpoints-based cosine similarity VAT (MVS-VAT) majorly used to access the prior information about clusters tendency problem. Solution of cluster tendency indicates the tractable number of clusters. The MVS-VAT enables the cluster tendency for the tweet documents effectively than other visual methods. However, it takes a higher number of viewpoints, thus requiring more computational time for the clustering of tweets data. Therefore, sampling-based visual methods are proposed to overcome the computational problem. Several standard health keywords are used for the extraction of health tweets to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed work in the experimental study.","Prasad, K. Rajendra; Reddy, B.

The Impact of Combating COVID-19 on Blood Culture Contamination and Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection Rates,2020-12-31,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease with a complex aetiology and high mortality. Functional and structural changes in the small pulmonary arteries lead to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, resulting in right heart failure. The pathobiology of PAH is not fully understood, and novel treatment targets in PAH are desperately needed. The renin-angiotensin system is critical for maintaining homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. The system consists of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis and the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas receptor axis. The former, the ACE-Ang II-AT(1)R axis, is involved in vasoconstrictive and hypertensive actions along with cardiac and vascular remodelling. The latter, the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis, generally mediates counterbalancing effects against those mediated by the ACE-Ang II-AT(1)R axis. Based on established functions, the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis may represent a novel target for the treatment of PAH. This review focuses on recent advances in pulmonary circulation science and the role of the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis in PAH.","Zhang, Feng; Chen, Aidong; Pan, Yan; Wang, Xingxing; Xu, Yu; Desai, Ankit A.; Tang, Haiyang; Han, Ying",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779643/,67

Diagnostic Utility of a Ferritin to Procalcitonin Ratio to Differentiate Patients with COVID-19 from Those with Bacterial Pneumonia,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common and serious acute paralytic neuropathy and is usually caused by infection. It is thought to be the result of an aberrant response of the immune system. To our knowledge, GBS, especially severe GBS, after orthopaedic surgery has rarely been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report the case of a 58-year-old man who developed quadriplegia and respiratory failure on the 6th day after surgery for multiple fractures. The patient had no symptoms of respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection within 4 weeks before the onset. The white blood cell count was normal, and there was no redness, swelling, heat or pain in the surgical incision. Brain, cervical and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging were normal, albuminocytological dissociation was found on cerebrospinal fluid examination, and electrophysiological examination showed that sensory and motor nerve evoked potentials could not be elicited. A diagnosis of post-traumatic GBS was made, and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, as well as supportive care and rehabilitation exercise. The length of stay was 18 months, and the in-hospital-related costs amounted to $127,171. At the last follow-up, the patient had recovered only grade 3 power in the upper limbs and grade 2 power in the lower limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Severe GBS is a rare complication after orthopaedic surgery. When progressive weakness occurs in trauma patients, the possibility of GBS should be considered, and cerebrospinal fluid and electrophysiological examinations should be performed in a timely manner. For patients with severe GBS after trauma, the treatment costs may be high, and the prognosis may be poor.","Chen, Jian; Ma, Jian-xiong; Zuo, Cai-hong; Zhang, Qing; Chen, Heng-ting; Ma, Xin-long",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781168/,67

In this study, structural equation modeling methodology (EQS 6.3) was applied to a sample of 120 top managers to examine how the cognitive orientation of scanning (rational vs. intuitive analysis of environment) may influence final issue categorizations. Results confirm that not only is procedural rationality needed when scanning the environment, as traditional arguments have posited, but also that intuition plays a relevant role, complementing rational processes and configuring a mixed set of competencies to assess different issue dimensions, such as favorability, urgency, and influence.","García-Carbonell, Natalia; Martín-Alcázar, Fernando; Sánchez-Gardey, Gonzalo",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781557/,67

Hepatic Laboratory Abnormalities Associated with Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19: A Pooled Analysis of 6 Retrospective Cohort Studies Including 755 Patients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) often do not have sufficient resources to practice public health interventions. PEH may reside at overcrowded shelters, have poor access to health care, and often suffer from significant co-morbid conditions. In this study, we describe prevalence of COVID-19 amongst PEH and homeless service staff in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as demographic data, underlying conditions, and symptoms. METHODS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Atlanta, PEH and homeless service providers were offered PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal, nasal mid-turbinate, and oropharyngeal swabs. Shelters identified as having a higher number of COVID-19 infections underwent re-testing 3–4 weeks after initial testing. Demographic information was collected, and individuals were screened for symptoms and underlying conditions. RESULTS: A total of 2,294 PEH and 544 staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from April 8 - May 6, 2020. 24 homeless shelters were included in this study. The majority of individuals were male (66.3% sheltered, 85.5% unsheltered, 55.3% staff), and 2,192 of 2,838 (78.3%) persons identified as black. Approximately half of individuals had no known underlying conditions (51.5% sheltered, 47.7% unsheltered, 55.5% staff). Cardiovascular disease was the most frequently reported condition (32.0%), followed by chronic lung disease (14.8%). In total, 45 of 2,823 (1.6%) individuals had detectable PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, including 35 of 1,666 (2.1%) sheltered clients, 3 of 614 (0.5%) unsheltered clients, and 7 of 543 (1.3%) staff. Among individuals with detectable SARS-CoV-2, 5 of 20 (25%) reported at least one symptom in the last week. Most shelters (16 of 24) had at least one individual with detectable SARS-CoV-2. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of shelters (19 of 24) was < 3%, with a median prevalence of 0.2% across all shelters. Upon retesting 4 shelters with a higher number of COVID-19 infections, only 3 individuals from 2 shelters tested positive out of 357 total retested (0.8%).

44090,361. A Case Control Study of COVID-19 Outcome in Patients with HIV,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in San Diego, California, the Infectious Disease Division at the University of California San Diego established a COVID-19 Clinic dedicated solely to managing patients safely in their homes. This strategy was developed in response to: i) concerns regarding transmission of infection in the healthcare setting, ii) avoiding overwhelming the healthcare system with COVID-19 patients, iii) providing patients with expedited access to specialists, and iv) reducing the burden on the emergency department and urgent care. METHODS: The COVID-19 clinic staff is comprised of a dedicated nurse, administrative assistant, and four infectious diseases (ID) physicians who aim to see patients within 24 hours of referral via virtual clinics 5 days a week. An ID physician initially assesses each patient in a direct telemedicine visit and answers their questions, assesses disease severity, provides both symptom management and emotional support, and education about self-isolation and transmission-based precautions. The patients are then triaged to daily nursing phone calls and follow up visits as needed. RESULTS: Over a period of 12 weeks (March 27 to June 16, 2020), the clinic has seen 179 patients. To assess the impact of the clinic, patients are asked to complete a 6-point verbal patients satisfaction survey after their visit. Of the 133 patients who have completed the survey to date, the vast majority reported high satisfaction with their encounters with the COVID-19 physician, with a mean score of 4.8 or higher on all six questions (on a scale of 1 to 5). When asked “Did you feel comfortable talking to your COVID-19 ID physician?” on a scale of 1 to 5, the average score was 4.9. When asked “Did the physician do a good job answering your questions?” the average was 4.9. Patients reported feeling safer after talking with their physician (mean score 4.8), and felt better educated on how to self-quarantine at home (mean score 4.85) and when to seek care from an emergency room, urgent care or hospital (mean score 4.83). CONCLUSION: The UCSD COVID-19 Clinic demonstrates how telemedicine can be utilized in response to a public health crisis by creating a virtual clinic to provide ID care for patients in their homes.

44093,362. A Modified Early Warning Score Predicts Decompensation in COVID-19 Patients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: One day after the pandemic was announced, Tennessee declared a state of emergency on March 12, 2020 with implementation of a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020. Data regarding the routes and patterns of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are limited. We initiated an investigation after clusters of confirmed COVID-19 cases attended a large social gathering. METHODS: We were notified of clinical providers who attended a “Silent School Auction” on March 7, 2020, of which several confirmed-cases were identified as targeted participants. To derive a standardized REDCap web-survey, we conducted a hypothesis-generating interview with three confirmed attendees to collect event details. Once finalized, enrollment included collecting sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data. Attendees were classified as: 1) confirmed if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; 2) suspected if they developed symptoms 21-days before or after the auction; and 3) asymptomatic if no symptoms were noted. RESULTS: From March 20-June 16, 100/166 (60%) of attendees were enrolled, with a median age of 41 years, 54% female, and 99% white. Of those, 34 and 32 were confirmed- and suspect-cases, respectively. Table 1 compares sociodemographic behaviors of all attendees, with the majority of confirmed-cases eating late in the evening. From March 6 to March 8, 58 participants reported attending other social events, of which three (i.e., church service, women’s retreat, and a birthday party) were common among 43 attendees and five individuals reported onset of mild respiratory symptoms prior to the event (Figure 1). Confirmed-cases were more likely to report having shortness of breath, chest tightness, loss of taste, loss of smell, and fever compared to suspect-cases (Figure 2) and no one required hospitalization. Dining tables from the school auction depicted a clustering of cases occurring at each table, with some individuals visiting more than one table during the event (Figure 3). CONCLUSION: We identified several COVID-19 cases from a single event that occurred prior to social mitigation strategies. Our investigation highlights the importance of staying home when sick and the significance of social distancing to halt transmission of COVID-19. DISCLOSURES: Danielle A.

Critically Ill patients Receiving Tocilizumab Compared With Those Not Receiving Tocilizumab for Treatment of COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the pandemic there has been limited data on mortality in people living with HIV (PLWH) who have Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States (US). We conducted a retrospective review to investigate potential risk factors associated with survival and need for medical ventilation for PLWH and COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort from a large academic center across three campuses, conducted from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Thirty day readmissions were observed from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Our patients were identified by an ICD-10 code (B20) corresponding to HIV and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. As a primary endpoint, we compared survivors vs. non-survivors. As a secondary endpoint, we compared patients who needed mechanical ventilator (MV) vs. those who did not need MV. RESULTS: Seventy two PLWH (28 female patients (39%), median [IQR] age was 62 [-/+16] years) had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests during this retrospective review. Median CD4+ count was 235 cells/ul and 11 (15%) had an HIV viral load >200 copies/mL. The median length of stay was 5 days and 6 patients were directly discharged from the emergency department. Ten patients were readmitted within 30 days with SARS-CoV-2 – like symptoms and 2 are still inpatient. Twenty patients (27.8%) have expired. All non-survivors that expired had an undetectable HIV viral load (0%, p=0.02). The 11 patients with unsuppressed HIV viral loads at the start of the study period all survived, p=0.02. Non-survivors were more likely to have chronic kidney disease CKD (p< 0.01) acute kidney injury (p< 0.01), higher absolute neutrophils (p< 0.01), and elevated IL-6 levels (p< 0.01) compared to survivors. Fifteen patients (20.8%) required mechanical ventilation (MV), 3 (4.1%) of those patients survived. Patients that required MV were more likely to be male (p=0.01) obese (p< 0.01) and had higher absolute neutrophil counts (p=0.01) versus those that did not need MV. Patients with lower CD4 counts (< 200 cells/uL) did not require more mechanical ventilation (p=0.04). Table 1: Demographics, Primary and Secondary Outcome Results [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: PLWH who had COVID-19 had a high mortality rate. Since all the patients who died had an undetectable HIV viral load across CD4 counts, our study suggests that patients with uncontrolled HIV are not at an increased risk of mortality.

44107,62. Association Between Influenza Co-infection and Poor Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: At the time of this writing, there is no FDA approved medication for the treatment of COVID-19. One medication currently under investigation for COVID-19 treatment is tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor. It has been shown there are increased levels of cytokines including IL-6 in severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients attributed to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Therefore, inhibition of IL-6 receptors may lead to a reduction in cytokines and prevent progression of CRS. The purpose of this retrospective study is to utilize a case-matched design to investigate clinical outcomes associated with the use of tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multi-center, case-matched series matched 1:1 on age, BMI, and days since symptom onset. Inclusion criteria included ≥ 18 years of age, laboratory confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 result, admitted to a community hospital from March 1(st) – May 8(th), 2020, and received tocilizumab while admitted. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, total mechanical ventilation days, mechanical ventilation mortality, and incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections. RESULTS: The following results are presented as tocilizumab vs control respectively. The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality for tocilizumab (n=26) vs control (n=26) was 10 (38%) vs 11 (42%) patients, p=0.777. The median hospital length of stay for tocilizumab vs control was 14 vs 11 days, p=0.275. The median days of mechanical ventilation for tocilizumab (n=21) vs control (n=15) was 8 vs 7 days, p=0.139, and the mechanical ventilation mortality was 10 (48%) vs 9 (60%) patients, p=0.463. In the tocilizumab group, for those expired (n=10) vs alive (n=16), 10 (100%) vs 7 (50%) patients respectively had a peak ferritin > 600 ng/mL, and 6 (60%) vs 8 (50%) patients had a peak D-dimer > 2,000 ng/mL. The incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections within 7 days of tocilizumab administration occurred in 5 (19%) patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tocilizumab may be a beneficial treatment modality for severe COVID-19 patients. Larger, prospective, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further validate results.

44131,77. Long Term Care Facility Residents Hospitalized with COVID-19 Infection Present with Atypical Symptoms,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Studies to date indicate that most adults develop IgG antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 6 weeks of COVID-19 symptom onset. The seroconversion rate of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) following COVID-19 is unknown. Elucidation of humoral immune responses following COVID-19 in SOTR may inform risk of reinfection and the development of safe and effective vaccines for immunocompromised hosts. METHODS: We assessed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection among adult SOTR diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR assays between 3/1/2020 and 6/5/2020. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in serum using the Abbott IgG assay at the manufacturer’s recommended cut-off. Our primary objective was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity after COVID-19. A secondary objective was to identify clinical factors associated with seroconversion. The mean age and nadir absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were calculated between seropositive and negative SOTR and compared by Student’s t-test. RESULTS: Among 93 SOTR diagnosed with COVID-19, 19 died before SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing could be performed, and 18 had testing pending as of abstract submission. 56 SOTR (44 kidney, 5 heart, 4 liver, 1 lung, and 1 heart-kidney recipients) completed testing and were included in the analysis. Median age was 58 years (IQR 49.5–67), and all received maintenance immunosuppression at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis with median nadir ALC during illness of 400 (IQR 200–600). SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was performed at a median of 60 days (IQR 50–70) from symptom onset, the shortest interval being 16 days. 47 out of 56 SOTR tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The likelihood of seroconversion was not different between those who were tested at < or ≥ 60 days from symptom onset (p=0.26), nor did it vary significantly by age (p =0.59), gender (p=0.53) or nadir ALC (p =0.28). CONCLUSION: 83% of evaluated SOTR with COVID-19 disease had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum at a median of 60 days after symptom onset. Studies are ongoing to identify variables associated with poor antibody response among the nearly 20% of SOTR in this cohort who failed to seroconvert. The significance of seroconversion on risk of reinfection and vaccine immunogenicity remains to be determined.

52518,Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19 Infection,2021-05-06,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection has resulted in a global pandemic with survival statistics 95–99%, however severe disease has been described. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients > age 18 admitted to Henry Ford Health System in Detroit from March 1 - June 1, 2020 for COVID-19 infection with aims to: 1. Determine the incidence of poor outcomes (mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU admission, death, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)), 2. Describe the clinical characteristics of this group, and 3. Evaluate relationships between demographics, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and inflammatory markers on outcomes. We hypothesized that older age, male gender, African American ethnicity, DM, obesity, and elevated inflammatory markers would predict poor outcomes. 8751 inpatients were included, of whom 682 (7.79%) required MV, 867 (9.91%) were admitted to the ICU, 753 (8.6%) died, and 430 (4.91%) had VTE. 4447 (50.8%) were African American, 4951 (56.6%) female, 5152 (58.9%) > age 50, and 2068 (23.6%) had DM. Of those who had BMI and A1c recorded, 2556 (50.2%) had BMI >30 kg/m(2) and 1138 (74.3%) had A1c >5.7%. Analyses controlling for demographics and comorbidities found that age and male gender were significant predictors of MV (OR = 1.031; CI= 1.025–1.037; P < 0.0001, OR =2.023; CI= 1.700–2.407; P<0.0001), ICU admission (OR 1.024; CI= 1.018–1.029; P<0.0001, OR 1.824; CI= 1.561–2.130; P<0.001), death (OR 1.077; CI= 1.069–1.085; P<0.0001, OR 1.823; CI= 1.521–2.185; P<0.0001), and VTE (OR 1.021; CI= 1.014–1.028; P<0.001, OR 1.293; CI= 1.043–1.603; P=0.0193). African American, compared to Caucasian ethnicity, was significantly associated with MV (OR 1.437; CI= 1.131–1.825; P=0.0009) and ICU admission (OR 1.428; CI= 1.150–1.773; P=0.0002), but not VTE. African Americans had significantly lower odds of death relative to Caucasians (OR 0.765; CI=0.604–0.969; P=0.0200). DM predicted MV (OR 1.999; CI= 1.677–2.383; P<0.0001), ICU admission (OR 2.014; CI= 1.717–2.364; P<0.0001), death (OR 1.501; CI= 1.250–1.803; P<0.0001), and VTE (OR 1.468; CI= 1.171–1.840; P=0.0009). Obesity predicted MV (OR 1.540; CI= 1.284–1.847; P<0.0001) and ICU admission (OR 1.395; CI= 1.186–1.642; P<0.0001) but not death or VTE. All inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ferritin, CRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin) were significantly correlated with MV and death. 3 of the 5 markers were also predictive of both ICU admission and VTE. This large retrospective study of a diverse population with a significant proportion of African Americans highlights the importance of taking age, male gender, African American ethnicity, presence of DM and obesity into account when determining risk of poor outcomes. These results contribute to the growing data on disparities in health care which have become more evident during this pandemic and the need to address this when designing public policy.","Hehar, Jaspreet; Todter, Erika; Lahiri, Sharon Wu",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089739/,67

Immunological methods to detect infection are available; however, cross-reactivity issues have been reported in most of them. Nucleic acid-based molecular assays offer high levels of specificity and sensitivity and can be used to detect the infections. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests to amplify Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in patients' blood. The amplicons were tested by both pH-sensitive dyes for enhanced visual detection and agarose gel electrophoresis. A closed-tube LAMP assay was also evaluated. Cohen's Kappa statistics was used for statistical analysis of the assays. 125 patients consented for blood sampling which were used for clinical analysis of LAMP assays with the PCR method used as the “gold standard.” RESULTS: The sensitivity of the evaluated Wuchereria bancrofti LAMP was 92.3%, with a specificity of 97.3% and kappa statistics value of 0.84, which is in a strong agreement. CONCLUSION: In this study, LAMP assays coupled with fluorescence dye detection have been found to be suitable for diagnosis and monitoring of Wuchereria bancrofti infections in the Kenyan population.","Nancy, Kinyatta; Lillian, Wambua; Wilkinson, Mutahi; Claire, Mugasa; Luna, Kamau; Dorcas, Wachira; Rosemary, Githae; Japheth, Lusweti; Christine, Ichugu; Emily, Waigi; Jim, Kagai",J Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8337116/,67
60824,Maternal finger-prick allogenic blood for persistent corneal epithelial defects.,2021-04-09,"PURPOSE Confirmation of bile excretion into the gastrointestinal tract is important to exclude biliary atresia (BA). We compared the duodenal tube test (DTT) with hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HS) for their efficiency in detecting bile secretion. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 47 infants who underwent both DTT and HS to diagnose or exclude BA between January 2000 and March 2018. RESULTS BA was diagnosed in 32 of the 47 patients, and 7 of the remaining 15 non-BA patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography. Among the various DTT parameters, the total bile acid in duodenal fluid (DF-TBA)/serum (S) gamma-glutamyl transferase (γGTP) ratio was found to be the most specific for BA, with sensitivity and specificity of 98.0-100%, respectively. One BA patient in whom cut off values were not met was a premature infant. The sensitivity and specificity of HS were 100-56.3%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the DF-TBA/S-γGTP parameter was higher than that of HS (98.6% vs. 85.1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The DTT could be more a specific method than HS to detect bile excretion. Thus, the DTT should be incorporated into the multidisciplinary diagnostic approach for the differential diagnosis of BA to prevent unnecessary intraoperative cholangiography in patients who do not have BA.","Yoshii, Daiki; Inomata, Yukihiro; Yamamoto, Hirotoshi; Irie, Tomoaki; Kadohisa, Masashi; Okumura, Kenji; Isono, Kaori; Honda, Masaki; Hayashida, Shintaro; Oya, Yuki; Hibi, Taizo",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02010-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314016/,67

In recent years, the role of inflammation in atherogenesis has been underpinned by pharmacological approaches targeting systemic inflammation that have led to a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although the use of nutraceuticals to prevent CVD has largely focused on lipid-lowering (e.g, red-yeast rice and omega-3 fatty acids), there is growing interest and need, especially now in the time of coronavirus pandemic, in the use of nutraceuticals to reduce inflammatory markers, and potentially the inflammatory CVD burden, however, there is still not enough evidence to confirm this. Indeed, diet is an important lifestyle determinant of health and can influence both systemic and vascular inflammation, to varying extents, according to the individual nutraceutical constituents.

However, right lobe anatomy is complex, not only from the inflow but also from the outflow perspective. Outflow reconstruction is one of the key requirements of a successful LDLT and venous drainage of the liver graft is just as important as hepatic inflow for the integrity of graft function. Outflow complications may cause acute graft failure which is not always easy to diagnose. The right lobe graft consists of two sections and three hepatic venous routes for drainage that require reconstruction. In order to obtain a congestion free graft, several types of vascular conduits and postoperative interventions are needed to assure an adequate venous allograft drainage.

Preliminary evidence suggests that this variability negatively affects people who stutter and that stuttering behaviors are more variable than adverse impact associated with stuttering. More information is needed to determine how variability affects people who stutter and what the clinical and research implications of variability may be. Method Two hundred and four adults who stutter participated in a mixed-methods study exploring (a) how variability of stuttering affects people who stutter in comparison to other aspects of the condition and (b) which aspects of the overall experience of stuttering are variable. Results Analyses indicated that variability is very commonly experienced by people who stutter and that it is among the most frustrating aspects of the condition. Qualitative analyses revealed that variability is experienced in all aspects of the stuttering condition, including the observable behavior other affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions; and the adverse impact of stuttering. Notable individual differences were found in terms of which specific aspects of the condition were more variable for different respondents. Overall, analyses revealed that the variability of different aspects of stuttering can be viewed in a hierarchy from most variable to least variable: more external aspects (e.g., frequency, duration), more internal aspects (e.g., covert behaviors, physical tension), and cognitive-affective experiences (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings, and self-image). Discussion These findings suggest that variability is a common and burdensome aspect of the experience of stuttering and underscore the importance of considering variability in stuttering behavior, reactions, and impact in research, assessment, and treatment for adults who stutter.","Tichenor, Seth E; Yaruss, J Scott",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_ajslp-20-00112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197323/,67

Telemedicine/telehealth will undoubtedly be useful/practical tools even though it remains at an elementary level; the contribution of the family and of caregivers in the management of AUD patients will play a significant role; the multidisciplinary intervention involving experts in the treatment of AUD with specialists in the treatment of COVID-19 disease will need implementation. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly leading addiction specialists towards a new governance scenario of AUD, which necessarily needs an in-depth reconsideration, focusing attention on a safe approach in combination with the efficacy of treatment.","Testino, Gianni; Vignoli, Teo; Patussi, Valentino; Allosio, Pierluigi; Amendola, Maria Francesca; Aricò, Sarino; Baselice, Aniello; Balbinot, Patrizia; Campanile, Vito; Fanucchi, Tiziana; Macciò, Livia; Meneguzzi, Cristina; Mioni, Davide; Parisi, Michele; Renzetti, Doda; Rossin, Raffaella; Gandin, Claudia; Bottaro, Luigi Carlo; Caio, Giacomo; Lungaro, Lisa; Zoli, Giorgio; Scafato, Emanuele; Caputo, Fabio",Addiction biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.13090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532923/,67

Tocotrienol-rich vitamin E, as Tocovid, has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation to ameliorate diabetes in rat models and human subjects. In this prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 54 patients (duration = 18.4 years, HbA1c = 8.8%) with diabetic nephropathy were randomized to receive Tocovid 200 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken to measure HbA1c, serum creatinine, estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine albumin:creatinine ratio, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and thromboxane-B2. Patients were reassessed 6-9 months post-washout. After 12 weeks of supplementation, Tocovid significantly decreased serum creatinine levels (mean difference: -3.3 ± 12.6 versus 5.4 ± 14.2, p = 0.027) and significantly increase eGFR (mean difference: 1.5 ± 7.6 versus -2.9 ± 8.0, p = 0.045) compared with placebo. There were no significant changes in HbA1c, blood pressure, and other parameters. Subgroup analysis revealed that in patients with low serum vitamin E concentrations at baseline, Tocovid reduced serum creatinine, eGFR, and VCAM-1 significantly. After 6-9 months of washout, persistent difference in serum creatinine remained between groups (mean difference: 0.82 ± 8.33 versus 11.26 ± 15.47, p = 0.031), but not eGFR. Tocovid at 400 mg/day significantly improved renal function in 12 weeks of supplementation, as assessed by serum creatinine and eGFR, which remained significant 6-9 months post-washout.","Tan, Gerald Chen Jie; Tan, Suzanne May Quinn; Phang, Sonia Chew Wen; Ng, Yeek Tat; Ng, En Yng; Ahmad, Badariah; Palamisamy, Uma Devi M; Kadir, Khalid Abdul",Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/2042018819895462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903178/,67

Aims: The aims of this study were to (1) create an evidence and gap map of interventions for pediatric chronic pain and (2) identify gaps between existing evidence and recently identified patient-oriented research priorities. Methods: We performed a systematic review of English-language peer-reviewed systematic reviews or clinical practice guidelines of pediatric chronic pain intervention published in the past 20 years. Database searches of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and SCOPUS were conducted inclusive to June 3, 2019. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR-2. Results: Of 4168 unique abstracts, 50 systematic reviews (including 2 clinical practice guidelines) crossing diverse pediatric chronic pain populations and intervention settings were included. One third were rated high quality, with half rated low to critically low quality. The largest proportion of reviews addressed psychological and pharmacological interventions, followed by interdisciplinary, other (e.g., dietary), and physical interventions. Most common outcomes included pain, physical, emotional, and role functioning and quality of life. Treatment satisfaction and adverse events were less common, with minimal report of sleep or economic factors. Most patient-oriented research priorities had not been investigated. Conclusions: Sufficient quality evidence is available to guide evidence-informed policies in pediatric chronic pain, most notably regarding psychological and pharmacological interventions. Numerous evidence gaps in patient-oriented research priorities and treatment outcomes should guide prioritization of research funds, as well as study aims and design.","Birnie, Kathryn A; Ouellette, Carley; Do Amaral, Tamara; Stinson, Jennifer N",Canadian journal of pain = Revue canadienne de la douleur,https://doi.org/10.1080/24740527.2020.1757384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987493/,67

However, little is known about the impact of coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without tuberculosis. METHODS We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25% lower than in those without (RR = 0.75,05% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p = .0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p = .0046). CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Sy, Karla Therese L; Haw, Nel Jason L; Uy, Jhanna",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2020.1806353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808838/,67

It is the leading cause for primary graft failure and mortality after lung surgery and transplantation. Here we aimed to find a more effective therapeutic approach to treat ALIRI. We evaluated the combinational effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the rat ALIRI model. HUMSCs were isolated for lentiviral-ACE2 transfection. Fifty rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham surgery, physiological saline (PS), ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs-ACE2 group. Several physiological, biochemical and histological indicators were examined and compared among the five groups, such as blood oxygen saturation (Sat O2 %) and right ventricular systolic blood pressure (RVSBP), pulmonary morphology observations, several kinds of cell markers and the abundance of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Compared with HUMSCs and ACE2 groups, HUMSCs-ACE2 group showed lighter lung injuries, higher CD31 and vWF expression (endothelial cell surface markers), lower γ-H2AX (DNA damage marker) and CD68 (inflammatory cell marker) and higher anti-oxidants expression (GR, GPX and NQO1). The results indicated that HUMSCs harbouring ACE2 were more effective than either HUMSCs or ACE2 alone in alleviating the ALIRI damages. The synergistic effects of HUMSCs and ACE2 provide informative clues for mechanism study and therapeutic method development of ALIRI.","Liu, Fabing; Gao, Fengying; Li, Qian; Liu, Zhenwei",Cell biochemistry and function,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230251/,67

We are failing on all fronts. We spend more money on healthcare per capita than our Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peers, and our outcomes are mediocre at best. Medicine is not personal, health care professionals often have their hands tied by payers, and geography has too much influence on the quality of care available. This has to end, especially since we have the technology to create a truly patient-focused, whole-person approach - one that treats physical and mental health equally and meets people where they are in every sense. Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher-quality, decentralized care that - when needed - brings specialty care to the masses. Other technologies have an important role, too. For patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1 diabetes), widespread uptake of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) the game-changer we need right now that can facilitate telemedicine to remote places and remove healthcare disparities.

Initiatives by the National Quality Forum, the Joint Commission, and the Surgical Care Improvement Project aim to improve the prevention of VTE and emphasize the need to recognize the risk of the condition in hospitalized patients. In clinical practice, individual risk assessment using a validated scoring system provides patients with the best care in the prevention of VTE. This is accomplished by a weighted scoring of risk factors, selection of the most appropriate prevention strategy for patients at risk, and regular risk review across the continuum of care. All hospitals should have a local, written, care pathway which assesses inpatient risk of VTE as early as possible upon admission and identifies members of the health care team responsible for applying risk assessment. Venous thromboembolism risk should be regularly reassessed for any changes in the level of risk, with extended out-of-hospital prophylaxis considered for patients with continued risk factors, such as prolonged immobility or illness, treated at home, or in a long-term care facility. Finally, a mandatory alert system requiring the clinician to address the issue of prophylaxis before any orders are carried out by the nursing staff is one way to protect all hospitalized patients.","Caprini, Joseph A",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029611404217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593024/,67

To effectively harness promising new technologies and address these and other public health challenges ahead, public health professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting and improving public health. This project sought to understand the network of health departments and organizations that provide training in order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby strengthening the public health system. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS We conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting Region V of the Department of Health & Human Services. The survey focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics to examine the network. RESULTS Of 290 participating health departments (58% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248 LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10 national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected to the state health department for training than to any other organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with its number of training connections. CONCLUSIONS State health departments may benefit from the support of universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs. Additional qualitative information from local and state health departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations to participate in training local practitioners to improve LHD capacity.","Harris, Jenine K; Leider, Jonathon P; Kulik, Phoebe; Beck, Angela",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729191/,67

136751,Sinonasal polyposis complicated with extradural abscess and lateral rectus palsy.,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND There are inherent limitations with previously reported inframammary fold (IMF) recreation methods. The IMF is firmly fixed to the chest wall, but not physiologically, and it is difficult to determine the correct IMF position in the supine position and in the absence of an implant. METHODS With our new IMF reconstruction method (i.e., drawstring method), the IMF is recreated by drawing a barbed suture, penetrating the dermis, along the IMF. The barbed suture is fixed to the costal cartilage at the medial IMF, and the head is drawn and cut externally at the lateral IMF. The IMF level and depth can be finely adjusted by the tension, in a seated position after implant insertion. Furthermore, the approach can be from a small incision, and a smooth IMF curve is reconstructed. RESULTS Our drawstring method was performed in 102 patients who underwent reconstruction using a breast implant (n = 95) or flap (n = 7). The mean patient age was 52.0 years (range 33-77 years) and the follow-up period was 12 months (range 3-18 months). Suture or implant infection or exposure did not occur. Suture slack occurred in ten patients with implant-based reconstruction; their IMF became shallow. Insufficient skin expansion (P < 0.005) and strong traction of the barbed suture from the caudal side (P < 0.05) were related to IMF slack. The total revision rate was 2.9 %. CONCLUSIONS With sufficient skin expansion, the drawstring method using a barbed suture enables smooth and symmetrical IMF reconstruction.

157169,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome with Features of Atypical Kawasaki Disease during COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-28,"Among the multiple organ disorders caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), acute lung failure following atypical pneumonia is the most serious and often fatal event. We hypothesized that two of the hydrophilic structural coronoviral proteins (S and E) would regulate alveolar fluid clearance by decreasing the cell surface expression and activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium (Na(+)) channels (ENaC), the rate-limiting protein in transepithelial Na(+) vectorial transport across distal lung epithelial cells. Coexpression of either S or E protein with human alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes led to significant decreases of both amiloride-sensitive Na(+) currents and gamma-ENaC protein levels at their plasma membranes. S and E proteins decreased the rate of ENaC exocytosis and either had no effect (S) or decreased (E) rates of endocytosis. No direct interactions among SARS-CoV E protein with either alpha- or gamma-ENaC were indentified. Instead, the downregulation of ENaC activity by SARS proteins was partially or completely restored by administration of inhibitors of PKCalpha/beta1 and PKCzeta. Consistent with the whole cell data, expression of S and E proteins decreased ENaC single-channel activity in oocytes, and these effects were partially abrogated by PKCalpha/beta1 inhibitors. Finally, transfection of human airway epithelial (H441) cells with SARS E protein decreased whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents. These findings indicate that lung edema in SARS infection may be due at least in part to activation of PKC by SARS proteins, leading to decreasing levels and activity of ENaC at the apical surfaces of lung epithelial cells.","Ji, Hong-Long; Song, Weifeng; Gao, Zhiqian; Su, Xue-Feng; Nie, Hong-Guang; Jiang, Yi; Peng, Ji-Bin; He, Yu-Xian; Liao, Ying; Zhou, Yong-Jian; Tousson, Albert; Matalon, Sadis",American journal of physiology.

This results in an effective Hamiltonian with an average field plus and effective non-Abelian gauge potential. The action of the proposed renormalization maps the zero-mode region into the ground state. Modes near zero energy have an antibonding nature in a triangular lattice. This leads to a phase-frustration effect associated with massive degeneration, and makes flat-bands modes similar to confined modes observed in other bipartite lattices. Suprisingly, the proposed Hamiltonian renormalization suggests that flat-bands at magic angles are akin to floppy-mode bands in flexible crystals or glasses, making an unexpected connection between rigidity topological theory and magic angle twisted two-dimensional heterostructures physics.","Naumis, Gerardo G.; Navarro-Labastida, Leonardo A.; Aguilar-M'endez, Enrique",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09473v3.pdf,67
178001,Coronavirus infection and vasculitis: Identifying associations mining the biomedical literature,2021,"The human movement plays an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. On an urban scale, people move daily to workplaces, schools, among others. Here, we are interested in exploring the effect of the daily local stay on the variations of some characteristics of dengue dynamics such as the transmission rates and local basic reproductive numbers. For this, we use a two-patch mathematical model that explicitly considers the daily mobility of people and real data from the 2010 dengue outbreak in Hermosillo, Mexico. Based on a preliminary cluster analysis, we divide the city into two regions, the south and north sides, which determine each patch of the model. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the transmission rates and local basic reproductive numbers of some urban mobility scenarios where residents of each patch spend daily the 100% (no human movement between patches), 75% and 50% of their day at their place of residence. For the north side, estimates of transmission rates do not vary and it is more likely that the local basic reproductive number to be greater than one for all three different scenarios. On the contrary, tranmission rates of the south side have more weight in lower values when consider the human movement between patches compared to the uncoupled case.

178611,SARS-CoV-2-reactive interferon-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells in patients hospitalized with Coronavirus viral disease-2019,,"Use of Deep Learning (DL) in commercial applications such as image classification, sentiment analysis and speech recognition is increasing. When training DL models with large number of parameters and/or large datasets, cost and speed of training can become prohibitive. Distributed DL training solutions that split a training job into subtasks and execute them over multiple nodes can decrease training time. However, the cost of current solutions, built predominantly for cluster computing systems, can still be an issue. In contrast to cluster computing systems, Volunteer Computing (VC) systems can lower the cost of computing, but applications running on VC systems have to handle fault tolerance, variable network latency and heterogeneity of compute nodes, and the current solutions are not designed to do so. We design a distributed solution that can run DL training on a VC system by using a data parallel approach. We implement a novel asynchronous SGD scheme called VC-ASGD suited for VC systems. In contrast to traditional VC systems that lower cost by using untrustworthy volunteer devices, we lower cost by leveraging preemptible computing instances on commercial cloud platforms. By using preemptible instances that require applications to be fault tolerant, we lower cost by 70-90% and improve data security.","Atre, Medha; Jha, Birendra; Rao, Ashwini",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08894v3.pdf,67

We describe the clinical features, management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure admitted to our ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS A case series of COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU for respiratory failure from 7 February, with data censoring at 30 June 2020, was performed from a review of medical records. RESULTS Twenty-two COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU for respiratory failure. The median age was 54.5 years (IQR 30-45.5), 72.7% were male and had at least one comorbidity. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores were 2.5 (IQR 1.25-7) and 10 (8.25-12) respectively. Thirteen patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and had a median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 194 mmHg (IQR 173-213) after intubation. The 28-day survival was 100%, with 2 patients demising subsequently. The overall ICU mortality rate was 9.1% at the time of data censoring. In IMV survivors, length of IMV and ICU stay were 11 days (IQR 9-17.75) and 16 days (IQR 12-32) respectively. CONCLUSION Low COVID-19 ICU mortality was observed in our ""pandemic-ready"" ICU. This was achieved by having adequate surge capacity to facilitate early ICU admission and IMV, lung protective ventilation, and slow weaning. Being able to maintain clinical standards and evidence-based practices without having to resort to rationing contributed to better outcomes.","Chew, Si Yuan; Lee, Yee Shay; Ghimiray, Deepak; Tan, Chee Keat; Chua, Gerald Sw","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000106/,67
199043,Impact of COVID-19 on immunization of Brazilian infants,2021,"Canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged as an apparently new virus during the mid-1970s. The origin of CPV is unknown, but a variation from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) or another closely related parvovirus is suspected. Here we examine the in vitro and in vivo canine and feline host ranges of CPV and FPV. Examination of three canine and six feline cell lines and mitogen-stimulated canine and feline peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed that CPV replicates in both canine and feline cells, whereas FPV replicates efficiently only in feline cells. The in vivo host ranges were unexpectedly complex and distinct from the in vitro host ranges. Inoculation of dogs with FPV revealed efficient replication in the thymus and, to some degree, in the bone marrow, as shown by virus isolation, viral DNA recovery, and Southern blotting and by strand-specific in situ hybridization. FPV replication could not be demonstrated in mesenteric lymph nodes or in the small intestine, which are important target tissues in CPV infection. Although CPV replicated well in all the feline cells tested in vitro, it did not replicate in any tissue of cats after intramuscular or intravenous inoculation. These results indicate that these viruses have complex and overlapping host ranges and that distinct tissue tropisms exist in the homologous and heterologous hosts.","Truyen, U; Parrish, C R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1323703/,67

Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However, this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued longterm existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28- to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2, 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with age. In both groups, there was greater mortality or morbidity among the infected in the old-age classes. These patterns are better explained by pathogen evolution than by age-related decline in immunity.","Baig, Ulfat; Laxm, Vidhya; Ojha, Akanksha; Watve, Milind",Journal of biosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345783/,67

To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","Szeto, Christopher; Chatzileontiadou, Demetra S M; Nguyen, Andrea T; Sloane, Hannah; Lobos, Christian A; Jayasinghe, Dhilshan; Halim, Hanim; Smith, Corey; Riboldi-Tunnicliffe, Alan; Grant, Emma J; Gras, Stephanie",iScience,,67

Clinical symptoms of smell and taste dysfunction are prominent features of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to elucidate the factors associated with smell and taste dysfunction amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A retrospective review of a multi-hospital health network's COVID-19 database between March and June 2020 was performed. Patients with self-reported smell or taste loss were included. Demographic information, patient comorbidities, and mortality data was obtained. There were 2892 patients included in this analysis and 117 reported smell or taste loss (4.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%-4.8%). The proportion of females with smell or taste loss was significantly higher than males (6.3% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001), whereas no differences existed between ethnicity or smoking status. When compared with age of 30-40 years, the age group of 10-20 years were most likely to present with smell or taste dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-26.12; P = 0.01). The majority of specific comorbidities were not associated with increased incidence of smell or taste dysfunction. Outpatient healthcare workers were more likely to present with smell or taste loss (OR 3.2, CI 1.8-5.47; P < 0.001). The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with smell or taste dysfunction was significantly lower than those without (0% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001). Smell or taste loss is more prevalent in women, younger age groups, and healthier individuals. It may be associated with lower mortality and a milder disease trajectory compared to the overall cohort.","Husain, Qasim; Kokinakos, Konstandina; Kuo, Yen-Hong; Zaidi, Faiha; Houston, Sean; Shargorodsky, Josef",Am J Otolaryngol,,67

As the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin in the middle and inner ear remain unclear, we analyzed the expression of these proteins in mouse ear tissues. STUDY DESIGN: Animal Research. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin in the Eustachian tube, middle ear spaces, and cochlea of mice. RESULTS: ACE2 was present in the nucleus of the epithelium of the middle ear and Eustachian tube, as well as in some nuclei of the hair cells in the organ of Corti, in the stria vascularis, and the spiral ganglion cells. ACE2 was also expressed in the cytoplasm of the stria vascularis. TMPRSS2 was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the middle spaces, with the expression being stronger in the nucleus in the mucosal epithelium of the middle ear spaces and Eustachian tube. TMPRSS2 was present in the cytoplasm in the organ of Corti and stria vascularis and in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the spiral ganglion. Furin was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear spaces, Eustachian tube, and cochlea. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin are diffusely present in the Eustachian tube, middle ear spaces, and cochlea, suggesting that these tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Fake news has been spreading about the COVID-19 pandemic. Since January 2020, the culprits and antidotes to disinformation have been digital media and social media. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to develop and test the psychometric properties of the 12-item Social Media Disinformation Scale (SMDS-12), which assesses the consumption, confidence, and sharing of information related to COVID-19 by social media users. METHODS: A total of 874 subjects were recruited over two phases: the exploratory phase group had a mean age of 28.39 years (SD 9.32) and the confirmatory phase group had a mean age of 32.84 years (SD 12.72). Participants completed the SMDS-12, the Internet Addiction Test, the COVID-19 Fear Scale, and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The SMDS-12 was initially tested by exploratory factor analysis and was subsequently tested by confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The test supported the three-factor structure. In addition, no items were removed from the measurement scale, with three factors explaining up to 73.72% of the total variance, and the items had a lambda factor loading ranging from 0.73 to 0.85. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the robustness of the measure by referring to a wide range of goodness-of-fit indices that met the recommended standards. The construct validity of the scale was supported by its convergent and discriminant validity. The reliability of the instrument examined by means of three internal consistency indices, and the corrected item-total correlation, demonstrated that the three dimensions of the instrument were reliable: Cronbach &#945; values were .89, .88, and .88 for the consumption, confidence, and sharing subscales, respectively. The corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.70 to 0.78. The correlation of the instrument's dimensions with internet addiction and mental health factors showed positive associations. CONCLUSIONS: The SMDS-12 can be reliably utilized to measure the credibility of social media disinformation and can be adapted to measure the credibility of disinformation in other contexts.","Guelmami, Noomen; Ben Khalifa, Maher; Chalghaf, Nasr; Kong, Jude Dzevela; Amayra, Tannoubi; Wu, Jianhong; Azaiez, Fairouz; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",JMIR Form Res,,67

The COVID-19 crisis has created a heightened role for nonmarket strategy and our paper argues that in deciding how to respond to a variety of policy measures introduced by governments, airline executives need to take into account the perceived legitimacy from the flying public of their response to governments. Our paper presents an integrative framework to analyze airlines' nonmarket response to COVID-19 governmental policy measures. Using a two-by-two matrix, we identify key conceptual links between industry's nonmarket response, the health impacts of a given policy measure as well as its economic costs for the airlines. Our study concludes that, unless economic stakes in a given policy measure are high, airlines do not risk active bargaining with governments over the content of that measure. Such bargaining could trigger a delegitimation cascade: a self-reinforcing process in which key stakeholders reassess their view of airlines' conduct and the industry's broader societal impact. Bargaining is pursued when economic impacts of policy measures are high, and in that case, the choice between cooperative and adversarial posture towards the government depends on the health impact of a given policy.","Akbar, Yusaf H.; Kisilowski, Maciej",J.

This study sought to investigate the content shared through FOAMed during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Tweets containing the #FOAMed hashtag posted during a 24-hour period in April 2020 were studied. Included tweets were analysed using the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework (building knowledge, holding knowledge, pooling knowledge and using knowledge). RESULTS: 1379 tweets contained the #FOAMed hashtag, of which 265 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Included tweets were posted from 208 distinct users, originated from each world continent and were in five different languages. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) signposting and appraising evidence and guidelines; (2) sharing specialist and technical advice; and (3) personal and social engagement. Among 12 subthemes within these groupings, 11 aligned to one of the four dimensions of the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework, and the other focused on building and managing social networks. Almost 40% of tweets related directly to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: #FOAMed tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic included a broad range of resources, advice and support. Despite the geographical, language and disciplinary variation of contributing users and the lack of organisational structure uniting them, this social media medical community has been able to construct, share and use emerging technical knowledge through a time of extraordinary challenge and uncertainty for the global medical community.","Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed; Yip, Sharon Wing Lam; Gill, Deborah; Arfeen, Zakia",Postgrad. med. j,,67

This was a retrospective study in a tertiary care center conducted through the period between March 2020 and November 2020 and included all adult patients with rheumatic diseases who tested positive on the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We assessed the patients' demographic data, history of rheumatic disease, COVID-19 symptoms and experimental treatment, if any, their disease course, and outcome. In all, 47 patients were included, and most were females. The commonest rheumatic diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (53.2%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (21.3%), and psoriatic arthritis (10.6%). Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine were the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in 36.1% and 25.5%, respectively. Out of 47 patients, 48.9% required hospitalization with a median hospital stay of 7 days. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as clinical signs of pneumonia plus one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 bpm, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation < 90% in room air was observed in 19.1% of the patients, and one patient died. We found that elderly patients with a mean age of 65.3 years were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that was statistically significant. Our study showed that elderly patients with a mean age of 65 years and having rheumatic diseases had an increased risk of hospital admission and development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Alzahrani, Zeyad A; Alghamdi, Khalid Abdullah; Almaqati, Ahmed Saeed",Rheumatol Int,,67

In this paper, we study the real-time cash replenishment planning problem under outflow uncertainty where the fee of the security companies grows if the replenishment ends up falling on a weekends/holidays. Our model is based by the Double Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm which combines popular Q-learning with a deep neural network. The proposed method is used to control replenishment operation in order to minimize replenishment cost where the cash demand changes dynamically at each day. Experiment results show that our proposed method can work effectively on the real outflow time-series and it is able to reduce the ATM operational cost compared with the other state-of-the-art cash demand prediction schemes. © 2021 IEEE.","Kiyaei, M.; Kiaee, F.","26th International Computer Conference, Computer Society of Iran, CSICC 2021",,67
219947,Surfing the COVID-19 scientific wave,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Without universal access to point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 testing, many hospitals rely on clinical judgement alone for identifying cases of COVID-19 early. METHODS: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust introduced a 'traffic light' clinical judgement aid to the COVID-19 admissions unit in mid-March 2020. Ability to accurately predict COVID-19 was audited retrospectively across different stages of the epidemic. RESULTS: One SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient (1/41, 2%) was misallocated to a 'green' (non-COVID-19) area during the first period of observation, and no patients (0/32, 0%) were mislabelled 'green' during the second period. 33 of 62 (53%) labelled 'red' (high risk) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive during the first period, while 5 of 22 (23%) 'red' patients were PCR positive in the second. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical risk stratification on initial assessment effectively identifies non-COVID-19 patients. However, diagnosing COVID-19 is challenging and risk of overcalling COVID-19 should be recognised, especially when background prevalence is low.","Jones, Nick K; Ramsay, Isobel; Moore, Elinor; Fuld, Jonathan; Adcock, Chris; Banham-Hall, Edward; Babar, Judith; Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrossyni; Mok, Hoi Ping",Clin Med (Lond),,67
220018,Antiretroviral laboratory monitoring and implications for HIV clinical care in the era of COVID-19 and Beyond,2020,"The unique health and aging challenges of rural populations often go unnoticed. In fact, the rural United States is home to disproportionate shares of older and sicker people, there are large and growing rural-urban and within-rural mortality disparities, many rural communities are in population decline, and rural racial/ethnic diversity is increasing.Yet rural communities are not monolithic, and although some rural places are characterized by declining health, others have seen large improvements in population health. We draw on these realities to call for new research in five areas.First, research is needed to better describe health disparities between rural and urban areas and, because rural places are not monolithic, across rural America. Second, research is needed on how trends in rural population health and aging are affecting rural communities. Third, research is needed on the ways in which economic well-being and livelihood strategies interact with rural health and aging. Fourth, we need to better understand the health implications of the physical and social isolation characterizing many rural communities. Finally, we argue for new research on the implications of local natural environments and climate change for rural population health and aging.","Jensen, Leif; Monnat, Shannon M; Green, John J; Hunter, Lori M; Sliwinski, Martin J",Am J Public Health,,67

Although scientists have been searching for methods to manage SARS-CoV-2, there is no specific medication against COVID-19 as of yet. Two main approaches should be followed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2; one of which is to neutralize the virus, and the other is to inhibit the host cell membrane receptors, where SARS-CoV-2 will bind. In this study, peptides derived from beta-lactoglobulin, which inactivates both the virus and its receptors in the host cell, were identified using computer-based in silico analysis. The beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides used in this study were obtained by the treatment of goat milk whey fraction with trypsin. The structure of the peptides was characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS), and six beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides were selected as candidate peptides. Subsequently, the effects of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and host cells were identified using virtual screening. According to the results of this in silico analysis, Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALMPHIR) and Ile-Pro-Ala-Val-Phe-Lys (IPAVFK) peptides were evaluated as potential candidates to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 after the future in vitro and in vivo studies.","Çakir, Bilal; Okuyan, Betul; Sener, Göksel; Tunali-Akbay, Tugba",Eur J Pharmacol,,67

We combine an infrastructure network of flight connections with a population density dataset to derive the mobility network, and then we define an epidemic framework to model the spread of the disease. Our approach combines a compartmental SEIRS model with a graph diffusion model to capture the clusteredness of the distribution of the population. The resulting model is characterised by the dynamics of a metapopulation SEIRS, with amplification or reduction of the infection rate which is determined also by the mobility of individuals. We use simulations to characterise and study a variety of realistic scenarios that resemble the recent spread of COVID-19. Crucially, we define a formal framework that can be used to design epidemic mitigation strategies: we propose an optimisation approach based on genetic algorithms that can be used to identify an optimal airport closure strategy, and that can be employed to aid decision making for the mitigation of the epidemic, in a timely manner.","Dolan, Hugo; Rastelli, Riccardo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12964v2.pdf,67

226872,Effect of immunosuppression maintenance in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The field of artificial intelligence (AI), regarded as one of the most enigmatic areas of science, has witnessed exponential growth in the past decade including a remarkably wide array of applications, having already impacted our everyday lives. Advances in computing power and the design of sophisticated AI algorithms have enabled computers to outperform humans in a variety of tasks, especially in the areas of computer vision and speech recognition. Yet, AI's path has never been smooth, having essentially fallen apart twice in its lifetime ('winters' of AI), both after periods of popular success ('summers' of AI). We provide a brief rundown of AI's evolution over the course of decades, highlighting its crucial moments and major turning points from inception to the present. In doing so, we attempt to learn, anticipate the future, and discuss what steps may be taken to prevent another 'winter'.","Toosi, Amirhosein; Bottino, Andrea; Saboury, Babak; Siegel, Eliot; Rahmim, Arman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01517v2.pdf,67

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is the first prospective observational study on patient-reported outcomes, quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction in patients with cancer with their care management in a day hospital during the period of May-June 2020. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Screener and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey were used. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 189 of 267 patients. They were generally aged 61 to 70 years and women and presented with lung, breast, or colorectal cancer. Patients had low anxiety scores (mean: 3.2±4.5), with only 11.1% showing anxiety. Risk factors of anxiety included female gender (p=0.03) and lifestyle (residence, family environment) (p=0.01). The patient's physical health was stable, whereas mental health had deteriorated (p<0.0001). Risk factors of altered HRQOL included age and lifestyle. Patients greatly appreciated all the facilities of the day hospital and its organisation. CONCLUSION: This study shows a preserved HRQOL and low anxiety of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Baffert, Kim-Arthur; Darbas, Tiffany; Lebrun-Ly, Valerie; Pestre-Munier, Julia; Peyramaure, Clementine; Descours, Clementine; Mondoly, Melanie; Latrouite, Simon; Bignon, Elisa; Nicouleau, Samantha; Geyl, Sophie; Leobon, Sophie; Deluche, Elise",In Vivo,,67
230373,Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic Infectors: Hidden Sources of COVID-19 Disease,2020,"Previous research has argued that fake news may have grave consequences for health behavior, but surprisingly, no empirical data have been provided to support this assumption. This issue takes on new urgency in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, and the accompanying wave of online misinformation. In this large preregistered study (N = 3,746), we investigated the effect of a single exposure to fabricated news stories about COVID-19 on related behavioral intentions. We observed small but measurable effects on some behavioral intentions but not others-for example, participants who read a story about problems with a forthcoming contact-tracing app reported a 5% reduction in willingness to download the app. These data suggest that one-off fake news exposure may have behavioral consequences, though the effects are not large. We also found no effects of providing a general warning about the dangers of online misinformation on response to the fake stories, regardless of the framing of the warning in positive or negative terms. This suggests that generic warnings about online misinformation, such as those used by governments and social media companies, are unlikely to be effective. We conclude with a call for more empirical research on the real-world consequences of fake news.

231623,"Favipiravir as an antiviral agent in COVID-19: same script, different cast?",2020,"Abstract COVID-19 has given rise to a myriad of social, psychological, and health-related complications. The specific mental health implications of COVID-19 are still being uncovered, but we know that there are likely to be negative outcomes for many people. This is particularly the case for vulnerable members of the community, such as those with high health anxiety, and under conditions where individuals feel isolated or disconnected from others. The objective of this study was to examine whether the level of socially motivated Internet use acts as a buffer of the relationship between health anxiety, isolation behaviors, and depression. Participants (N = 473; 67.3 percent female; Mage = 23.03, SD = 7.50) from Australia completed self-report measures during the height of the national pandemic restrictions (April-May 2020). A regression analysis revealed positive relationships between health anxiety and isolation behaviors on depression and highlighted a three-way interaction effect. Specifically, health anxiety was significantly negatively associated with depression when participants engaged in fewer isolation behaviors. However, at higher levels of isolation behaviors, the relationship between health anxiety and depression was attenuated for participants with greater levels of online social connection. The findings suggest that online social connection buffered the negative effects of health anxiety under conditions of isolation. These results offer promising avenues to mitigate against vulnerabilities during the pandemic and highlight the need to promote alternate social support mechanisms in the absence of face-to-face connection.","Stuart, Jaimee; O039,; Donnell, Karlee; Donnell, Alex; Scott, Riley; Barber, Bonnie",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

To conduct our study, we made use of the 2017 Swiss Health Survey and employed an ordered probit model with each prevention aspect as a dependant variable. Our results show that, except for alcohol consumption, higher insurance deductibles were significantly associated with higher behavioural prevention. Our study also highlighted how numerous other factors influenced prevention and offered some guidance for public policies to further incentivise prevention decisions.","Nicolas, Christina",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,67

235213,Plea for multitargeted interventions for severe COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on older and frail people underlines the importance of advance care planning (ACP). ACP is a dynamic communication process involving patients, families and healthcare providers, which serves to discuss and document wishes and goals for future care. Currently, ACP practice is often suboptimal. This implies that important decisions about care and treatment may need to be made acutely in crises. Many factors contribute to suboptimal ACP practice. One such factor is ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities of different disciplines in the ACP-process. The perception that having ACP conversations is primarily a physician's task is a misconception. Specific skills that could contribute to a holistic and person-centered ACP-process are largely lacking in nursing curricula and therefore, may be insufficient and under-utilized. For instance, nursing staff could involve persons in conversations about meaning, quality of life, loss and grief as a part of ACP. Moreover, they may communicate a patient's wishes to other healthcare providers including physicians. Acknowledgement of this potential role, by physicians as well as by nursing staff themselves, is needed for ACP to become a truly interprofessional process.","Bolt, Sascha R; van der Steen, J T; Schols, Jos M G A; Zwakhalen, Sandra M G; Janssen, D J A; Meijers, J M M",Tijdschr. gerontol. geriatr,,67

236152,Periungual desquamation in a Japanese adult recovering from severe COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Population mobility is closely associated with COVID-19 transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive nonpharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina is one of the US states that reopened early, following which it experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9, 14, 28, 20, and 9 days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3%-74.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Using Twitter-based population mobility data could provide acceptable predictions of COVID-19 daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. Population mobility measured via social media data could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.","Zeng, Chengbo; Zhang, Jiajia; Li, Zhenlong; Sun, Xiaowen; Olatosi, Bankole; Weissman, Sharon; Li, Xiaoming",J Med Internet Res,,67

236956,Geographical disparities in clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir,2020,"Being expensive and time-consuming to collect massive COVID-19 image samples to train deep classification models, transfer learning is a promising approach by transferring knowledge from the abundant typical pneumonia datasets for COVID-19 image classification. However, negative transfer may deteriorate the performance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and task semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on different characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset has no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this unsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics. Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN significantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to recently strong baselines. Moreover, we show that TAN also achieves superior performance on several public domain adaptation benchmarks.","Wang, Jindong; Feng, Wenjie; Liu, Chang; Yu, Chaohui; Du, Mingxuan; Xu, Renjun; Qin, Tao; Liu, Tie-Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05114v1.pdf,67

240613,A five day course of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 may reduce the duration of illness,2020,"The new disease COVID-19 pandemic has completely modified our lifestyle, changing our personal habits and daily activities and strongly our professional activity. Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes. Informed consent must include risks of complications related to COVID-19 disease. Surgery must be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to avoid increase of operating time and risks of complications. Surgical approach of BPH must be considered depending on availability of disposable material, infrastructure, and the epidemiological COVID-19 status of your area.

247867,Keeping childhood immunisation rates stable during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"We investigate the Brownian diffusion of particles in one spatial dimension and in the presence of finite regions within which particles can either evaporate or be reset to a given location. For open boundary conditions, we highlight the appearance of a Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion: at long times, the particle distribution is non-Gaussian but its variance grows linearly in time. Moreover, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient of the particles in such systems is bounded from below by $(1-2/\pi)$ times their bare diffusion coefficient. For periodic boundary conditions, i.e., for diffusion on a ring with resetting, we demonstrate a ``gauge invariance'' of the spatial particle distribution for different choices of the resetting probability currents, in both stationary and non-stationary regimes. Finally, we apply our findings to a stochastic biophysical model for the motion of RNA polymerases during transcriptional pauses, deriving analytically the distribution of the length of cleaved RNA transcripts and the efficiency of RNA cleavage in backtrack recovery.","Tucci, Gennaro; Gambassi, Andrea; Gupta, Shamik; Rold'an, 'Edgar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05173v1.pdf,67

METHODS: Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, Mage = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. RESULTS: For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Tara M; Ellis, Wendy; Litt, Dana M",J Adolesc Health,,67

Design: This study is a longitudinal study from 24 January 2020 to 28 February 2020. Methods: There are 71 nursing staff working in the emergency isolation wards of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital that participated in this study. The questionnaires were conducted with Likert scale. The operation assessment teachers have received standardized training. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression Scale (SDS) were applied to assess the mental state of nurses. Results: After short-term training, these nurses can handle the emergency tasks in a timely manner. The pass rate of nurse theory and operation assessment is 100%. The 111 suspected patients admitted to the emergency isolation ward have been scientifically diagnosed and treated, the three confirmed patients have received appropriate treatment. No nurses have been infected. Conclusions: In this study, the personalized emergency training mode was feasible in the emergency isolation ward during the COVID-19 epidemic, which rapidly improved the rescue ability of nurses and effectively avoid the occurrence of cross-infection. This mode can provide a valuable reference for the emergency training of nurses in the future.","Zhou, Min; Yuan, Fei; Zhao, Xiaolong; Xi, Fanjie; Wen, Xianxiu; Zeng, Li; Zeng, Wenbo; Wu, Haiyan; Zeng, Hui; Zhao, Ziyu",,,67

Familial Cluster of COVID-19 Cases Associated with High Prevalence of Anosmia, Ageusia, and Gastrointestinal Symptoms",2020,"BACKGROUND: Antiviral and immune-modulating properties of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) against Coronaviridae have been reported by in vitro studies, but no in vivo evidence is yet available. We sought to know whether the timing of prophylactic doses of LMWH during the course of COVID-19 may affect the time to SARS-CoV-2 nasal-oropharyngeal swab negativization. METHODS: Retrospective monocentric cross-sectional study on patients requiring sub-intensive ward admission due to first SARS-CoV-2 infection and undergoing early (EH; within 7 days from COVID-19 signs and symptoms onset) versus delayed prophylactic LMWH (DH; after 7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR according to scheduled time points: first swab after 2 weeks from COVID-19 onset, then at 1-week intervals until negativity. RESULTS: Time to SARS-CoV-2 swab negativity was shorter in EH (38 patients) compared with DH (55 patients): 22 versus 37 days (P=0.004). The number of confirmative negative swabs in EH was significantly higher compared with DH at week 2 (21.1% versus 3.6%; P=0.017) and 4 (60.0% versus 19.6%; P<0.001). At univariate, EH differed from DH for several disease severity and clinical management parameters. Nevertheless, after accounting for the differences, Cox regression showed early LMWH administration (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91 [1.51, 5.63]; P=0.002) and higher lymphocytes nadir (HR 1.04 [1.01, 1.08]; P=0.020) as predictors of shorter time to swab negativity. CONCLUSIONS: This potential antiviral and/or immune-modulating activity of LMWH needs further in vivo confirmations by randomized controlled trials.","Trunfio, Mattia; Salvador, Elena; Gaviraghi, Alberto; Audagnotto, Sabrina; Marinaro, Letizia; Motta, Ilaria; Casciaro, Riccardo; Ghisetti, Valeria; Fava, Carmen; Bonora, Stefano; Di Perri, Giovanni; Calcagno, Andrea",Antivir Ther,,67

It has also been used as a basis for language-integrated query in programming languages such as F#, Scala, and Links. However, SQL's treatment of incomplete information, using nulls and three-valued logic, is not compatible with `standard' NRC based on two-valued logic. Nulls are widely used in practice for incomplete data, but the question of how to accommodate SQL-style nulls and incomplete information in NRC, or integrate such queries into a typed programming language, appears not to have been studied thoroughly. In this paper we consider two approaches: an explicit approach in which option types are used to represent (possibly) nullable primitive types, and an implicit approach in which types are treated as possibly-null by default. We give translations relating the implicit and explicit approaches, discuss handling nulls in language integration, and sketch extensions of normalization and conservativity results.","Cheney, James; Ricciotti, Wilmer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11347v1.pdf,67

262513,Asthma may not be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in children,2021,"The highly infective coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel strain of coronaviruses - the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - discovered in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China). Remarkably, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across all continents and turned into a public health emergency, which was ultimately declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2020. SARS-CoV-2 presents similar aspects to other members of the coronavirus family, mainly regarding its genome, protein structure and intracellular mechanisms, that may translate into mild (or even asymptomatic) to severe infectious conditions. Although the mechanistic features underlying the COVID-19 progression have not been fully clarified, current evidence have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may primarily behave as other ß-coronavirus members. To better understand the development and transmission of COVID-19, unveiling the signaling pathways that may be impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the molecular and cellular levels, is of crucial importance. In this review, we present the main aspects related to the origin, classification, etiology and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, here we describe the potential mechanisms of cellular interaction and signaling pathways, elicited by functional receptors, in major targeted tissues/organs from the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems. Furthermore, the potential involvement of these signaling pathways in evoking the onset and progression of COVID-19 symptoms in these organ systems are presently discussed. A brief description of future perspectives related to potential COVID-19 treatments is also highlighted.","Battagello, Daniella S; Dragunas, Guilherme; Klein, Marianne O; Ayub, Ana L P; Velloso, Fernando J; Correa, Ricardo G",Clin Sci (Lond),,67

272707,Healthcare worker infections and deaths due to COVID-19: A survey from 37 nations and a call for WHO to post national data on their website,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic and associated supply-chain disruptions emphasise the requirement for antimicrobial materials for on-demand manufacturing. Besides aerosol transmission, SARS-CoV-2 is also propagated through contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. As such, the development of effective biofunctional materials that can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are critical for pandemic preparedness. Such materials will enable the rational development of antiviral devices with prolonged serviceability reducing the environmental burden of disposable alternatives. This research reveals the novel use of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) to 3D print porous Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) superalloy with potent antiviral activity (100% viral inactivation in 30 mins). The porous material was rationally conceived using a multi-objective surrogate model featuring track thickness (tt) and pore diameter ({phi}d) as responses. The regression analysis found the most significant parameters for Co-Cr-Mo track formation to be the interaction effects of scanning rate (Vs) and laser power (Pl) in the order PlVs > Vs > Pl. Contrastively, the pore diameter was found to be primarily driven by the hatch spacing (Sh). The study is the first to demonstrate the superior antiviral properties of 3D printed Co-Cr-Mo superalloy against an enveloped virus used as biosafe viral model of SARS-CoV-2. The material significantly outperforms the viral inactivation time of other broadly used antiviral metals such as copper and silver from 5 hours to 30 minutes. As such the study goes beyond the current state-of-the-art in antiviral alloys to provide extra-protection to combat the SARS-COV-2 viral spread. The evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic brings new and unpredictable challenges where on-demand 3D printing of antiviral materials can achieve rapid solutions while reducing the environmental impact of disposable devices.

METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis-à-vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Among patients on haemodialysis, higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, and among those with acute on chronic kidney disease. In the late phase of the outbreak, there was a statistically significant increase in disease severity without a corresponding increase in mortality.","Nithya, Govindasamy; Lamech, Tanuj Moses; Arumugam, Venkatesh; Dineshkumar, Thanikachalam; Gopalakrishnan, Natarajan; Aiswarya, Dhanapalan; Shaji, Sajmi; Sastry, Bhagavatula V R H; Solomon, Dolphin; Kannan, Badri Srinivasan; Sakthirajan, Ramanathan; Rajendran, Padmaraj",J. nephrol,,67

275159,Undetected infectives in the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Testing is a crucial control mechanism for an epidemic outbreak because it enables the health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases, thereby limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people, when no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In this paper, an epidemic model that incorporates the testing rate as a control input is presented. The proposed model distinguishes between the undetected infected and the detected infected cases with the latter assumed to be isolated from the disease spreading process in the population. Two testing policies, effective during the onset of an epidemic when no treatment or vaccine is available, are devised: (i) best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and (ii) constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST is a suppression policy that provides a lower bound on the testing rate to stop the growth of the epidemic. The COST is a mitigation policy that minimizes the peak of the epidemic by providing a constant, optimal allocation of tests in a certain time interval when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 in France.","Niazi, Muhammad Umar B.; Kibangou, Alain; Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos; Nikitin, Denis; Tumash, Liudmila; Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12553v1.pdf,67

The nurses' responsibilities were almost the same and worked in the general ward with no aerosol generating medical procedures. Two HCPs were expected to have similar infectiousness, but the number of secondary transmission by each HCP were different. Eleven close contacts from HCP1 were notified, and all of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, 13 of 35 close contacts of HCP2 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. While working, mask-wearing style differed between the two HCPs. HCP1 wore a KF94 mask appropriately and kept wearing it while working. HCP2 wore a surgical mask while working, but often pulled it down to her chin or removed it. It was strongly suspected that the difference of mask wearing contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, other factors such as talkative behavior, exposure time, ventilation in rooms, and hand hygiene performance rates, could also have affected the transmission of COVID-19. It is crucial that healthcare workers wear a mask adequately and continuously, and they maintain proper hand hygiene while working during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Ansaeng; Kim, Young Jun; Cho, Ji-Hyun; Lee, Jae Hoon",Braz J Infect Dis,,67
276511,What reinfections mean for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on healthcare system globally. Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice. METHODS: Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when > 70% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or > 80% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square (&#967;2) test (p < 0·05 was considered as unstable). RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16-24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated laboratory confirmed (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) inpatient cases of coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-19), referred to Sina hospital, a tertiary educational hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, from March 10 to May 20, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, outcomes and treatment data were extracted and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 611 patients (234 women and 377 men) were included with 155 patients having GI symptoms. The most prevalent reported GI symptom was nausea/vomiting in 115 (18.8%) of patients. A total of 20 patients (3.2%) only had GI symptoms (without respiratory symptoms). There was no statistically significant difference in the clinical outcomes, disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality between patients with and without GI symptoms. Aspartate Aminotransferase level was associated with 446% increased risk of disease severity (adjusted odds ratio: 5.46, 95% CI: 2.01 to 14.81) (P=0.040) among patients with GI symptoms. Additionally, we found that treatment with antibiotics in addition to mechanical ventilation was associated with increased survival among patients with GI symptoms (Pearson Chi square: 6.22; P value: 0.013). CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to patients with only GI symptoms for early patient detection and isolation. Moreover, patients with GI manifestations are not exposed to higher rates of disease severity or mortality.","Montazeri, Mahnaz; Maghbouli, Nastaran; Jamali, Raika; Sharifi, Alireza; Pazoki, Marzieh; Salimzadeh, Ahmad; Barzegari, Behnaz; Rafiei, Najme; Mansouri, Ensieh Sadat; Hadadi, Azar",Arch Iran Med,,67

We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2-S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2-S and does not block the interaction of CoV2-S with ACE2. Nevertheless, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS-CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus, and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.","Schmitz, Anton; Weber, Anna; Bayin, Mehtap; Breuers, Stefan; Fieberg, Volkmar; Famulok, Michael; Mayer, Günter",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,,67

To limit multicollinearity a principal component analysis was conducted, the results of which showed that three components together could explain 65% of the total variance that were therefore subjected to further study. Comparison of a generalized linear model (GLM) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) indicated an improvement in model performance using GWR (goodness of fit=93%) compared to GLM (goodness of fit=86%). The local coefficient of determination (R2) showed a significant influence of specific demographic and socioeconomic factors on COVID-19, including percentages of Omani and non-Omani population at various age levels; spatial interaction; population density; number of hospital beds; total number of households; purchasing power; and purchasing power per km2. No direct correlation between COVID- 19 rates and health facilities distribution or tobacco usage. This study suggests that Poisson regression using GWR and GLM can address unobserved spatial non-stationary relationships. Findings of this study can promote current understanding of the demographic and socioeconomic variables impacting the spatial patterns of COVID-19 in Oman, allowing local and national authorities to adopt more appropriate strategies to cope with this pandemic in the future and also to allocate more effective prevention resources.","Al Kindi, Khalifa M; Al-Mawali, Adhra; Akharusi, Amira; Alshukaili, Duhai; Alnasiri, Noura; Al-Awadhi, Talal; Charabi, Yassine; El Kenawy, Ahmed M",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),,67

Comment on Arshad et al",2020,"In developing countries macroeconomic volatility is common, and severe negative economic shocks can substantially increase poverty and food insecurity. Less well understood are the implications of these contractions for child acute malnutrition (wasting), a major risk factor for under-5 mortality. This study explores the nutritional impacts of growth shocks over 1990-2018 by linking wasting outcomes collected for 1.256 million children from 52 countries to lagged annual changes in national income. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest that a 10% annual decline in national income increases moderate/severe (WHZ&lt;-2) and severe wasting (WHZ&lt;-3) by 14 and 22 percent. An exploration of possible mechanisms suggests negative economic shocks increase risks of diarrhea, fever, and maternal underweight prevalence, and reduce child dietary diversity. Applying these results to the predicted economic impacts of COVID-19 suggests that millions of pre-school children are at increased risk of wasting and wasting-related morbidity and mortality unless urgent preventative action is taken.","Headey, D.; Ruel, M.",IFPRI - Discussion Papers|2020.

PCB118 can accumulate in human tissues, serum and breast milk, which leads to direct exposure of the fetus during development. In the present study, pregnant mice were exposed to 0, 20 and 100 µg/kg/day of PCB118 during the stage of fetal primordial germ cell migration. Compared with the control group, we found morphological alterations of the seminiferous tubules and a higher sperm deformity rate in the male offspring in the treatment groups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns in the treatment groups of the imprinted genes H19 and Gtl2 in the sperm were altered in the male offspring. We also characterized the disturbance of the expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt3l, and Uhrf1. The results indicated that intrauterine exposure to low doses of PCB118 could significantly damage the reproductive health of the male offspring.

County-level predictors of COVID-19 testing across the 62 counties in New York State: A comparison across machine learning algorithms,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections place a heavy burden on patients and healthcare providers and impact health care institutions financially. Reducing nosocomial infections requires an integrated program of prevention and control using key clinical best care practices. No instrument currently exists that measures these practices in terms of personnel time and material costs. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an instrument that would measure nosocomial infection control and prevention best care practice costs, including estimates of human and material resources. METHODS: An evaluation of the literature identified four practices essential for the control of pathogens: hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening and additional precaution. To reflect time, materials and products used in these practices, our team developed a time and motion guide. Iterations of the guide were assessed in a Delphi technique; content validity was established using the content validity index and reliability was assessed using Kruskall Wallis one-way ANOVA of rank test. RESULTS: Two rounds of Delphi review were required; 88% of invited experts completed the assessment. The final version of the guide contains eight dimensions: Identification [83 items]; Personnel [5 items]; Additional Precautions [1 item]; Hand Hygiene [2 items]; Personal Protective Equipment [14 items]; Screening [4 items]; Cleaning and Disinfection of Patient Care Equipment [33 items]; and Hygiene and Sanitation [24 items]. The content validity index obtained for all dimensions was acceptable (> 80%). Experts statistically agreed on six of the eight dimensions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study developed and validated a new instrument based on expert opinion, the time and motion guide, for the systematic assessment of costs relating to the human and material resources used in nosocomial infection prevention and control. This guide will prove useful to measure the intensity of the application of prevention and control measures taken before, during and after outbreak periods or during pandemics such as COVID-19.","Tchouaket Nguemeleu, Eric; Boivin, Sandra; Robins, Stephanie; Sia, Drissa; Kilpatrick, Kelley; Brousseau, Sylvain; Dubreuil, Bruno; Larouche, Catherine; Parisien, Natasha",PLoS One,,67

These workers have been dealing with drastic changes in the care they provide to their residents including cancelation of group activities and communal dining and even restrictions of activities outside rooms. Healthcare workers have also been devoting more time and energy to perform COVID-related medical duties. Geriatric facilities have been facing shortages in equipment and supplies, as well as staffing shortages. Finally, healthcare workers have been facing challenges regarding their personal safety and that of their families. Consequently, we hypothesized the presence of high levels of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: To evaluate burnout in healthcare workers in French acute care geriatric facilities, we used an online survey based on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Eighty-four healthcare workers answered the survey, during April of 2020. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated that they were experiencing medium levels of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement. CONCLUSION: This level of burnout reflected their fatigue, loss of energy, and/or feelings of being overextended and exhausted. Considering the expected cumulative impact of various stressors, the medium level of burnout observed has come as a surprise to us and might actually be considered as relatively good news. Nevertheless, no level of burnout is negligible and has wide ranging negative consequences.","El Haj, Mohamad; Allain, Philippe; Annweiler, Cédric; Boutoleau-Bretonnière, Claire; Chapelet, Guillaume; Gallouj, Karim; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; Roche, Jean; Boudoukha, Abdel Halim",J Alzheimers Dis,,67
286409,Patient satisfaction with telemedicine encounters in an allergy and immunology practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"Counterproductive lung inflammation and dysregulated thrombosis contribute importantly to the lethality of advanced COVID-19. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic - azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline - might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus; a large case series evaluating this combination in early-stage patients reported an impressively low mortality rate. However, whereas HCQ and AZM can promote QT interval lengthening and may be contraindicated in more advanced COVID-19 entailing cardiac damage, doxycycline has no such effect and exerts a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to HCQ, we propose that the combination of PTX + DIP can be used in both early and advanced stages of COVID-19. Concurrent use of certain nutraceuticals - yeast beta-glucan, zinc, vitamin D, spirulina, phase 2 inducers, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, quercetin, and magnesium - might also improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19.","DiNicolantonio, James J; Barroso-Aranda, Jorge",Med Hypotheses,,67
286410,Patient satisfaction with telemedicine encounters in an allergy and immunology practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening the global human population, including in countries with resource-limited health facilities. Severe bilateral pneumonia is the main feature of severe COVID-19, and adequate ventilatory support is crucial for patient survival. Although our knowledge of the disease is still rapidly increasing, this review summarizes current guidance on the best provision of ventilatory support, with a focus on resource-limited settings. Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited. Oxygen delivery can be increased by using a non-rebreathing mask and prone positioning. The presence of only hypoxemia should in general not trigger intubation because hypoxemia is often remarkably well tolerated. Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation. In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential. Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important. This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.","Dondorp, Arjen M; Hayat, Muhammad; Aryal, Diptesh; Beane, Abi; Schultz, Marcus J",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,67

Indeed, the home-isolation in addition to the high-level of distress given by fear of infection, has significantly resulted in a large number of psychological-consequences. Moreover, in order to guarantee a continuity of care, different measures have been applied among hospitals such as the implementation of teledermatology services. For these reasons, we implemented at our Dermatological-Clinic psychological video-consultations through our teledermatology-services. Herein we report our experience of 23 psychological-video-consultations, which led to achieve a significant reduction of DLQI (from 4.4 ± 3.9 at baseline to 1.6 ± 2.5 at week-4) in patients suffering from chronic skin conditions during the COVID-19 era.","Marasca, Claudio; De Rosa, Anna; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Cantelli, Mariateresa; Patrì, Angela; Vastarella, Maria; Gallo, Lucia; di Vico, Francesca; Poggi, Serena; Ruggiero, Angelo",J Dermatolog Treat,,67

290148,Lessons learned responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is spreading globally with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 serving as the entry point of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This raised concerns how ACE2 and the Renin-Angiotensin (Ang)-System (RAS) are to be dealt with given their roles in hypertension and their involvement in COVID-19's morbidity and mortality. Specifically, increased ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) might theoretically increase COVID-19 risk by increasing SARS-CoV-2 binding sites. However, ACE2 is part of the protective counter-regulatory ACE2-Ang1-7-MasR axis, which opposes the classical ACE-AngII-AT1R regulatory axis. We used Gitelman's and Bartter's syndromes (GS/BS) patients, rare genetic tubulopathies that have endogenously increased levels of ACE2, to explore these issues. Specifically, 128 genetically confirmed GS/BS patients, living in Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and Veneto, the Northern Italy hot spots for COVID-19, were surveyed via telephone survey regarding COVID-19. The survey found no COVID-19 infection and absence of COVID-19 symptoms in any patient. Comparison analysis with the prevalence of COVID-19 in those regions showed statistical significance (p &lt; 0.01). The results of the study strongly suggest that increased ACE2 does not increase risk of COVID-19 and that ACEi and ARBs by blocking excessive AT1R-mediated Ang II activation might favor the increase of ACE2-derived Ang 1-7. GS/BS patients' increased ACE2 and Ang 1-7 levels and their characteristic chronic metabolic alkalosis suggest a mechanism similar to that of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine effect on ACE2 glycosylation alteration with resulting SARS-COV-2 binding inhibition and blockage/inhibition of viral entry. Studies from our laboratory are ongoing to explore GS/BS ACE2 glycosylation and other potential beneficial effects of BS/GS. Importantly, the absence of frank COVID-19 or of COVID-19 symptoms in the BS/GS patients cohort, given no direct ascertainment of COVID-19 status, suggest that elevated ACE2 levels as found in GS/BS patients at a minimum render COVID-19 infection asymptomatic and thus that COVID-19 symptoms are driven by ACE2 levels.","Calo, L.

Reduction of healthcare-associated viral infections during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Poor mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may prompt the utilization of various coping behaviors, including alcohol use. We aimed to investigate the relationships between mental health symptomatology and self-reported changes in alcohol consumption at the onset of the pandemic. Data were from the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study of US adults aged &#8805;55 in April and May 2020 (n = 6548). We used population-weighted multivariable-adjusted multi-nomial logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between mental health (of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, each) and self-reported increased alcohol consumption (vs. no change in consumption). One in ten adults (717/6548; 11%) reported an increase in their alcohol consumption in the past week compared to their usual pre-COVID-19 drinking. Mental health symptomatology was associated with increased drinking since the pandemic onset (depression: OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.99-3.56; anxiety: OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.34-2.42; loneliness: OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.83-3.28). Participants who screened positive for all three mental health outcomes were substantially more likely to report increased alcohol consumption since the onset of the pandemic (OR = 3.87, 95% CI: 2.52-5.96, vs. no mental health outcomes). This study demonstrates potentially harmful changes in alcohol intake among middle-to-older aged adults experiencing mental health symptomatology during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Eastman, Marisa R; Finlay, Jessica M; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,67

Le but fut d’évaluer la résultante de cela sur la qualité de vie (QV) perçue par les PS hospitaliers. Matériels et méthodes Étude « hors Loi Jardé », prospective, non interventionnelle, sous forme d’un auto-questionnaire anonyme proposé en mai 2020 à tous les PS d’un CHU d’une région alors de moyenne endémie SARS-CoV-2 ayant ouvert 200 lits dédiés et mobilisé 1000 PS en renfort sur 4 mois. Elaboration du questionnaire par le team d’infectiologie, validation par les instances, généralisation en ligne (Lime Survey) via Intranet et Facebook. En environ 10minutes 71 items dont 27 échelles visuelles (0 à 10) et 5 cadres libres comparant la QV personnelle et professionnelle à celle des mois antérieurs. Cotations 6 à 10 considérées comme positives. Résultats Sur 794 réponses (11 % des PS du CHU) 259 par IDE, 228 d’autres soignants, 179 de médecins et 55 de cadres de santé, dont 311 (39 %) en unités dédiées COVID (155 permanents et 156 renforts). Cohorte surtout jeune (moyenne: 41 ans), féminine (80 %), en couple (90 %), chargée d’enfant (73 %), en maison (72 %) au CHU depuis &gt;5 ans (79 %). Retentissement sur la vie personnelle du confinement jugé acceptable sur le plan matériel et relationnel respectivement par 76 % et 56 %. QV professionnelle s’abaissant moins sur le plan matériel (58 % vs 62 avant) que relationnel (70% vs 81). Globalement engagement dans la lutte contre l’épidémie évalué important par 72%, 50% se sentant valorisé, 82 % davantage fatigué, 69% vivant la période comme plus difficile professionnellement et 68% personnellement. Chez ceux confrontés aux cas (en unité dédié ou sous forme sporadique ailleurs) 72 % se disant à l’aise dans la pratique et 71 % bien protégés. Relation patient (COVID ou non) vécue différente par 47 %. Encouragements en tant que PS exprimés à 63% surtout par la famille;stigmatisation de 19 % surtout par des quidams. Réponses libres par 147 (18 %) des répondants, riches, pointant les failles mais aussi la solidarité. Conclusion Ce questionnaire sur la QV des PS a intéressé pas seulement ceux impliqués dans la gestion d’unités COVID, soulignant que beaucoup souhaitaient témoigner sur ce temps particulier à un moment où la fin de crise pouvait être espérée prochaine. Malgré « les protocoles changeant », « le manque de matériel », « le bouleversement des habitudes et repères » mais grâce au « soutien entre équipes » « à la période riche avec les patients et entre soignants » le bilan global s’avère contrasté avec une QV finalement pas plus altérée professionnellement que personnellement. L’analyse se poursuit par une comparaison selon le métier, le lieu d’affectation (unité COVID ou non) et les modalités d’exercice (habituel ou renfort).","Grelier, A.; Guérin, O.; Caillot, F.; Levavasseur, F.; Bénichou, J.; Caron, F.",Infectious Diseases Now,,67

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower income countries may reduce overall risk but limited health system capacity coupled with closer inter-generational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower income countries due to the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being and economies of these countries.","Walker, Patrick G T; Whittaker, Charles; Watson, Oliver J; Baguelin, Marc; Winskill, Peter; Hamlet, Arran; Djafaara, Bimandra A; Cucunubá, Zulma; Olivera Mesa, Daniela; Green, Will; Thompson, Hayley; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Donnelly, Christl A; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Fu, Han; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Geidelberg, Lily; Grassly, Nicholas; Haw, David; Hayes, Sarah; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Mishra, Swapnil; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Unwin, H Juliette; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walters, Caroline E; Wang, Haowei; Wang, Yuanrong; Xi, Xiaoyue; Lalloo, David G; Ferguson, Neil M; Ghani, Azra C",Science (Wash.),,67

COVID19 has presented a test to the current system, as well as means by which to explore whether the UK's food supply chain will be resilient to future disruptions. In the face of a growing need to ensure that food supply is more environmentally sustainable and socially just, COVOD19 also represents an opportunity to consider the ability of the system to innovative, and its capacity for change. The purpose of this case based study is to explore the response and resilience of the UK fruit and vegetable food supply chain to COVID19, and to assess this empirical evidence in the context of a resilience framework based on the adaptive cycle. To achieve this we reviewed secondary data associated with changes to retail demand, conducted interviews with 23 organisations associated with supply to this market, and conducted four video workshops with 80 organisations representing half of the UK fresh produce community. The results highlight that, despite significant disruption, the retail dominated fresh food supply chain has demonstrated a high degree of resilience. In the context of the adaptive cycle, the system has shown signs of being stuck in a rigidity trap, as yet unable to exploit more radical innovations that may also assist in addressing other drivers for change. This has highlighted the significant role that innovation and R&D communities will need to play in enabling the supply chain to imagine and implement alternative future states post COVID.","Mitchell, Rebecca; Maull, Roger; Pearson, Simon; Brewer, Steve; Collison, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00279v1.pdf,67
298680,Spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Kuwait,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to pediatric transport programs. The aims of this study were to describe the transport of pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to review the operational challenges that our transport system encountered. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was performed to review all COVID-19 pediatric transport performed over a 6-month period during the initial pandemic surge in 2020. Pediatric patients with a known positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test at the time of transport were included. Patients' hospital records, including their transport record, were reviewed for demographics, diagnoses, transport interventions and complications, and admission disposition. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the patient cohort. RESULTS: Of the 883 transports performed between April and October 2020, 146 (16%) tested positive for COVID-19 during the initial surge in our geographical area. Patient acuity was diverse with 40% of children having a chronic complex medical condition. More than 25% of children required aerosol-generating procedures during transport. The most common medical diagnosis was respiratory compromise, and the most common surgical diagnosis was appendicitis. No adverse events occurred during transports, and no transport team members contracted COVID-19 because of workplace exposure. Transport program operational challenges ranged from rapidly changing system logistics/policies to educational and utilization of proper personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Children with COVID-19 can be transported safely with adaption of transport program procedures. Change management and team stress should be anticipated and can be addressed with repeated education and messaging.","McPherson, Mona L; Krennerich, Emily C; Arrington, Amy S; Sitler, S Garry; Graf, Jeanine M",Pediatr. emerg. care,,67

Methods: We used data from a U.S.-based online survey (March 2020) to examine patterns of social support and prosocial behavior, explore differences between people with and without depression or anxiety, and explore correlates of social engagement in both groups, including symptom severity in the clinical group. Results: The clinical group reported greater social engagement. In both groups, social engagement was positively associated with COVID-19-related worry and trait moral elevation;mindfulness was positively associated with all outcomes for the clinical group only. Social interaction frequency had little influence on outcomes. Depressive symptom severity was positively associated with all outcomes, whereas anxiety was negatively associated with prosocial behavior.

Information on detail pathogenesis, host immune responses and responsible biological pathways are limited. Therefore, infection specific host gut responses and dietary supplements to neutralize immune inflammation demand extensive research. This study aimed to find differences in global co-expression protein-protein interaction sub-network and enriched biological processes in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected gut enterocytes cell line. Attempts have also been made to predict some dietary supplements to boost human health. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected differential express proteins were integrated with the human protein interaction network and co-expression subnetworks were constructed. Common hubs of these sub-networks reshape central cellular pathways of metabolic processes, lipid localization, hypoxia response to decrease oxygen level and transport of bio-molecules. The major biological process enriched in the unique hub of SARS-CoV-2 significantly differ from SARS-CoV, related to interferon signaling, regulation of viral process and influenza-A enzymatic pathway. Predicted dietary supplements can improve SARS-CoV-2 infected person''s health by boosting the host immunity/reducing inflammation.

Lockdown is among options suggested to reduce spread of the virus. This study aimed to determining the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Tunisian consumer awareness, attitudes and behaviors related to food wastage. An online survey was conducted during the first 2 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown. The survey collected information on demographic data, awareness and attitudes toward food waste, food purchase behavior and household food expenditure estimation; extent of household food waste; willingness and information needs to reduce food waste. This study included 284 respondents. About 89% of respondents claimed to be aware of food waste, and the COVID-19 lockdown would impact for 93% of respondents, their waste levels, and for 80%, their grocery shopping habits. Interestingly, the COVID-19 lockdown improved food shopping performances and pushed toward a positive behavioral change regarding food wastage: 85% respondents declared nothing of what they bought would be discarded, and most of the respondents have set up a strategy of saving, storing and eating leftovers. The most cited reasons given for discarding food were overcooking, inappropriate storage and overbuying. Consumers' changes in food waste prevention might be probably driven more by the socioeconomical context of the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. food availability, restricted movements, loss of income), than by a pro-environmental concern. Finally, our study pointed out the consumers' needs of information for taking further action. In conclusion, our study can constitute a basis to further promote household food waste prevention behavior, outlasting the COVID-19 crisis.","Jribi, Sarra; Ben Ismail, Hanen; Doggui, Darine; Debbabi, Hajer",Environ Dev Sustain,,67

Methods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance quantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalize to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding anatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and body habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognize race. Findings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race, such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further study. Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model has access to.","Banerjee, Imon; Bhimireddy, Ananth Reddy; Burns, John L.; Celi, Leo Anthony; Chen, Li-Ching; Correa, Ramon; Dullerud, Natalie; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Huang, Shih-Cheng; Kuo, Po-Chih; Lungren, Matthew P; Palmer, Lyle; Price, Brandon J; Purkayastha, Saptarshi; Pyrros, Ayis; Oakden-Rayner, Luke; Okechukwu, Chima; Seyyed-Kalantari, Laleh; Trivedi, Hari; Wang, Ryan; Zaiman, Zachary; Zhang, Haoran; Gichoya, Judy W",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10356v1.pdf,67

Geometric mean titres (GMT) &#8805;50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 [interquartile range (IQR) 44-69] years. Median time from HTx to the first vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6-14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titres in response to the first vaccine dose [GMT 90 (IQR 54-229) AU/mL]. Overall, 49% of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the first or the full two-dose vaccine schedule [GMT 426 (IQR 106-884) AU/mL]. Older age [68 (IQR 59-70) years vs. 46 (IQR 34-63) years, P = 0.034] and anti-metabolite-based immunosuppression protocols (89% vs. 44%, P = 0.011) were associated with low immunogenicity. Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to the first vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the second vaccine dose. Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 two-dose vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The generally achieved protection from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients. The possible benefit of additive vaccine should be further studied.","Itzhaki Ben Zadok, Osnat; Shaul, Aviv A; Ben-Avraham, Binyamin; Yaari, Vicky; Ben Zvi, Haim; Shostak, Yael; Pertzov, Barak; Eliakim-Raz, Noa; Abed, Galia; Abuhazira, Miriam; Barac, Yaron D; Mats, Israel; Kramer, Mordechai R; Aravot, Dan; Kornowski, Ran; Ben-Gal, Tuvia",Eur. j. heart fail,,67

316996,Safety of remdesivir vs standard care in patients with moderate COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pneumonia presented a unique problem for healthcare systems with the potential to overwhelm hospitals and lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Safe triage and follow up systems are required to manage this unprecedented demand. METHODS: We designed a pathway for the triage and assessment of patients based on their resting oxygen saturations and response to a 30 metre rapid walking test. We admitted patients to a 'Virtual Ward' for remote oximetry monitoring from the Emergency Department, step down from inpatient wards and from the local Primary Care 'Hot Hub'. This allowed the safe and managed readmission of those patients who deteriorated at home. RESULTS: During the first wave of COVID-19 we entered 273 onto the pathway for Virtual Ward follow up. Of these, 31 patients were readmitted to hospital, two were admitted to Intensive Care and one patient died. Median oxygen saturation at presentation was 97 % (IQR 96-98%) and following a 30 metre walk test 96% (IQR 94-97%). Median NEWS-2 score was 2 (IQR 1-3). On feedback 99.5% of patients were likely or extremely likely to recommend the service to their family and friends. There was a cost avoidance of £107,600 per month. CONCLUSION: It is safe, feasible and cost effective to set up a triage system with remote oximetry monitoring for patients with COVID-19 and overwhelmingly patients find it a positive experience.","Nunan, J; Clarke, D; Malakouti, A; Tannetta, D; Calthrop, A; Xu, X H; Chan, N B; Khalil, R; Li, W; Walden, A",Acute Med,,67

317042,Early Impact of social distancing in response to COVID-19 on hospitalizations for acute bronchiolitis in infants in Brazil,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets and close contact, probably by aerosol. Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical staffs. Effective prevention and control strategies must be compulsorily implemented to prevent nosocomial infection. This recommendation is intended to be followed by healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is in epidemic. Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution principles and considerations are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, operating procedure, environment and equipment. Indications of pulmonary function testing should be followed strictly. It is strongly recommended to suspend the test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative. Medical personnel should mandatorily adhere to the standard stratification of precaution measures. Patients/Subjects should be isolated in a separate area for testing. Disposable in-line filters must be used during pulmonary function testing. Cleaning and disinfection procedures for environment and equipment in pulmonary function testing laboratory should be paid more attention.",,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,67
317766,The unfinished story of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19: The right anti-inflammatory dose at the right moment?,2020,"Aims: To evaluate vitamin D3 levels in patients who presented with increased musculo-skeletal pain after release of lockdown period when compared to pre-lockdown status. Introduction: During this COVID pandemic, many countries have implemented lockdown measures and people have to work from home and many students and workers have to restrict themselves to home. During this period, their outdoor activities were limited. After the partial release of this lockdown many of them started to have some kind of physical activity and started experiencing body pains. We evaluated such patients for vitamin D3 levels and symptoms of fibromyalgia. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients from age group 18-60 presented to outpatient department or on telephonic consultation after partial release of lockdown. All patients who had mild back ache before lockdown and had symptoms exaggerated during this lockdown release were included. All patients were investigated for vitamin D3, PTH, thyroid profile, liver functional and kidney functional tests. Results: Out of 120 patients presented to us in a period of 3 months, 31 patients had increased symptoms when compared to pre-lockdown status. 20 out of 31 patients had low vitamin D3 levels. 14 patients also developed symptoms of fibromyalgia. Conclusion: There might be many reasons for increased pain during lockdown, but we focussed specially only on vitamin D3 because of its association with increased symptoms of COVID-19. This is a gentle reminder to test for vitamin D3 levels and supplement if found deficient.

317968,COVID-19: Four Paediatric Cases in Malaysia,2020,"Background: COVID-19 is spreading rapidly all over the world, the patients' symptoms can be easily confused with other pneumonia types. Therefore, it is valuable to seek a laboratory differential diagnostic protocol of COVID-19 and other pneumonia types on admission, and to compare the dynamic changes in laboratory indicators during follow-up. Methods: A total of 143 COVID-19, 143 bacterial pneumonia and 145 conventional viral pneumonia patients were included. The model group consisted of 140 COVID-19, 80 bacterial pneumonia and 60 conventional viral pneumonia patients, who were age and sex matched. We established a differential diagnostic model based on the laboratory results of the model group on admission via a nomogram, which was validated in an external validation group. We also compared the 400-day dynamic changes of the laboratory indicators among groups. Results: LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression showed that eosinophils (Eos), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), potassium(K), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) could differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia types. The C-index of the nomogram model was 0.922. Applying the nomogram to the external validation group showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.902. The 400-day change trends of the laboratory indexes varied among subgroups divided by sex, age, oxygenation index (OI), and pathogen. Conclusion: The laboratory model was highly accurate at providing a new method to identify COVID-19 in pneumonia patients. The 400-day dynamic changes in laboratory indicators revealed that the recovery time of COVID-19 patients was not longer than that of other pneumonia types.","Wang, Jing; Zheng, Yufen; Chen, Yijun; Hu, Xingzhong; Peng, Minfei; Fang, Yicheng; Shen, Bo; Lu, Guoguang",,,67

This study explored how dietary fat intake was impacted in a sample of the UK public who were social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from a UK COVID-19 online survey. Fat intake was measured using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using Becks' Anxiety and Depression Inventories, while the short-form Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale assessed mental well-being. Differences between individuals who increased versus decreased fat intake were explored using chi-square or independent sample t-tests. Association between fat intake and mental health was explored using adjusted linear regression models. RESULTS: Eight hundred and eighty-seven adults were included. Approximately, 34% recorded medium-to-high levels of fat consumption during social distancing. Around 48% reported decreased fat intake during social distancing compared to usual levels, while 41.3% documented increased fat intake. Fat intake was not significantly associated (P > 0.05) with any measures of mental health. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of a sample of UK adults social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic recorded decreased fat intake when compared to levels prior to social distancing. There appeared to be no associations between fat intake and mental health.","Wilson, Jason J; McMullan, Ilona; Blackburn, Nicole E; Klempel, Natalie; Yakkundi, Anita; Armstrong, Nicola C; Brolly, Colette; Butler, Laurie T; Barnett, Yvonne; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark A",J. public health (Oxf),,67

Their efforts have been further hampered by the politicization of the pandemic, including media outlets that question the seriousness and necessity of protective actions. The availability of highly politicized news from online platforms has led to concerns about the notion of ""echo chambers,"" whereby users are exposed only to information that conforms to and reinforces their existing beliefs. Using a sample of 5,000 US residents, we explored their information-seeking tendencies, reliance on conservative and liberal online media, risk perceptions, and mitigation behaviors. The results of our study suggest that risk perceptions may vary across preferences for conservative or liberal bias; however, our results do not support differences in the mitigation behavior across patterns of media use. Further, our findings do not support the notion of echo chambers, but rather suggest that people with lower information-seeking behavior may be more strongly influenced by politicized COVID-19 news. Risk estimates converge at higher levels of information seeking, suggesting that high information seekers consume news from sources across the political spectrum. These results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for the study of online echo chambers and their practical implications for public health officials and emergency managers.","Lachlan, Kenneth A; Hutter, Emily; Gilbert, Christine",Health Secur,,67
321612,A Case Report of Acute Motor and Sensory Polyneuropathy as the Presenting Symptom of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Background: In health and medicine, people heavily use the Internet to search for information about symptoms, diseases, and treatments. As such, the Internet information can simulate expert medical doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Aim: This article aims to evaluate a dataset of search terms to determine whether search queries and terms can be used to reliably predict skin disease breakouts. Furthermore, the authors propose and evaluate a model to decide when to declare a particular month as Epidemic at the US national level. Methods: A Model was designed to distinguish a breakout in skin diseases based on the number of monthly discovered cases. To apply this model, the authors correlated Google Trends of popular search terms with monthly reported Rubella and Measles cases from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Regressions and decision trees were used to determine the impact of different terms to trigger the occurrence of epidemic classes. Results: Results showed that the volume of search keywords for Rubella and Measles rises when the volume of those reported diseases rises. Results also implied that the overall process was successful and should be repeated with other diseases. Such process can trigger different actions or activities to be taken when a certain month is declared as “Epidemic.” Furthermore, this research has shown great interest for vaccination against Measles and Rubella. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the search queries and keyword trends can be truly reliable to be used for the prediction of disease outbreaks and some other related knowledge extraction applications. Also search-term surveillance can provide an additional tool for infectious disease surveillance. Future research needs to re-apply the model used in this article, and researchers need to question whether characterizing the epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves in United States can be done through search queries and keyword trends.","Obeidat, Rand; Alsmadi, Izzat; Bani Bakr, Qanita; Obeidat, Laith",Infect.

Methods: We developed a highly specific and sensitive approach to measuring antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for population-scale immune surveillance. Antibody positivity was defined as a dual-positive response against both the receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies were measured by immuno-precipitation assays in capillary blood from 15,771 children aged 1 to 18 years living in Bavaria, Germany, and participating in a public health type 1 diabetes screening program (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04039945), in 1,916 dried blood spots from neonates in a Bavarian screening study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03316261), and in 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Virus positive incidence was obtained from Bavarian health authority data. Findings: Dual-antibody positivity was detected in none of 3887 children in 2019 (100% specificity) and 73 of 75 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (97.3% sensitivity). Antibody surveillance in children during 2020 resulted in frequencies of 0.08% in January to March, 0.61% in April, 0.74% in May, 1.13% in June and 0.91% in July. Antibody prevalence from April 2020 was six-fold higher than the incidence of authority-reported cases (156 per 100,000 children), showed marked variation between the seven Bavarian regions (P<0.0001), and was not associated with age or sex. Transmission in children with virus-positive family members was 35%; 47% of positive children were asymptomatic. No association with type 1 diabetes autoimmunity was observed.

It can be classified into primary HLH, often inherited, orsecondary which is triggered by non-genetic causes, such as chronicimmunosuppression, malignancy or infection.Primary HLH is morefrequently observed in infants, however, secondary HLH is morecommonly observed in adults. Diagnosis is often delayed, most likelydue to the rarity of the condition and is usually prompted by serologicalabnormalities, including hyperferritinaemia, organ and bone marrowdysfunction.Treatment options are limited;however, the Royal FreeHospital has observed a number of secondary HLH cases who weresuccessfully treated with steroids and anakinra.MethodsA retrospective search of clinic letters and patient records wasundertaken using electronic care records. We also searched throughpharmacy records of patients treated with anakinra at the Royal FreeHospital. Patients with a documented diagnosis of HLH prior to March2020 who had been referred to Rheumatology were included. Weexcluded patients after March 2020 due to patients with COVID-19having similar overlap of symptoms and biomarkers as those withHLH. We identified key demographic details, laboratory, pathologyinvestigations, the course of hospital admission, primary diagnosis andfollow-up data. The diagnosis was confirmed withan H-score and bonemarrow biopsy where possible.ResultsWe identified nine adult cases with adocumented diagnosis of HLHwhohad been admitted to the Royal Free Hospitaland referred toRheumatology. They had allbeen subsequently followed up inoutpatientclinic.Ages of patients ranged from 19 to 58 with a male tofemale ratio of 2:1. The predominant underlying pathology wasadultonsetStill's disease(78%), with the remaining cases beingsecondary to HIV (22%). Bone marrow aspirate was performed in allpatients and 78% of patients aspirated had bone marrowappearancesin keeping with HLH.Ferritin levels varied from 532 micrograms/Lto93309 micrograms/L with a median ferritin of 5045.5 micrograms/L.HScores were variable witha median score of 171.5 (96-238).All patientsreceived steroids as part of their treatment.

Playing outdoors more than 2 h/day, following a daily routine and being active in online P.E. increased the odds of healthy levels of physical activity and screen time, particularly in mildly affected countries. In severely affected countries, online P.E. contributed most to meet screen time recommendation, whereas outdoor play was most important for adequate physical activity. Promoting safe and responsible outdoor activities, safeguarding P.E. lessons during distance learning and setting pre-planned, consistent daily routines are important in helping children maintain healthy active lifestyle in pandemic situation. These factors should be prioritised by policymakers, schools and parents.Highlights To our knowledge, our data provide the first multi-national estimates on physical activity and total screen time in European children roughly two months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic.Only 1 in 5 children met the WHO Global physical activity recommendations.Under pandemic conditions, parents should set pre-planned, consistent daily routines and integrate at least 2-hours outdoor activities into the daily schedule, preferable on each day. Schools should make P.E. lessons a priority. Decision makers should mandate online P.E. be delivered by schools during distance learning. Closing outdoor facilities for PA should be considered only as the last resort during lockdowns.","Kovacs, Viktoria A; Starc, Gregor; Brandes, Mirko; Kaj, Monika; Blagus, Rok; Leskosek, Bojan; Suesse, Thomas; Dinya, Elek; Guinhouya, Benjamin C; Zito, Viviana; Rocha, Paulo M; Gonzalez, Benito Perez; Kontsevaya, Anna; Brzezinski, Michal; Bidiugan, Radu; Kiraly, Anita; Csányi, Tamás; Okely, Anthony D",Eur J Sport Sci,,67
329254,"COVID-19, superinfections and antimicrobial development: What can we expect?",2020,"Although food insecurity has been associated with a disadvantageous socioeconomic status, especially in older adults, its association with comorbidities is less clear. The scope of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of food insecurity among older adults and evaluate the association between food insecurity, malnutrition, chronic disease, multimorbidity and healthcare utilization. A total of 121 older adults (mean (standard deviation) age: 72.6 (8.1)) were recruited from a Primary Care Health Center from 10 August 2019 to 10 September 2019. Food insecurity and malnutrition status were assessed by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Mini Nutritional Assessment tool, respectively. Recorded variables included financial, family data and comorbidities. The prevalence of food insecurity in the sample reached 50.4%, with men and older adults malnourished or at risk for malnutrition, exhibiting high risk for food insecurity. Multimorbidity, frequency of health care utilization and medication adherence were not associated with food insecurity, possibly due to the free health services and remunerated medications offered by the Greek government. However, male gender and malnutrition risk were significant predictors of food insecurity in the multiple logistic analyses. This study highlights the need for mainstreaming food insecurity assessment among older adults with comorbidities, especially those at risk for malnutrition.","Gkiouras, Konstantinos; Cheristanidis, Stavros; Papailia, Theopoula D; Grammatikopoulou, Maria G; Karamitsios, Nikolaos; Goulis, Dimitrios G; Papamitsou, Theodora",Nutrients,,67

The cellular regulation of IBV pathogenesis and the host immune responses involved remain to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators of numerous cellular processes, including responses to viral infections. Here, we employed a high-throughput sequencing approach to analyze the miRNA composition of the spleen and the lungs of chicken embryos upon IBV infection. Compared to healthy chicken embryos, 13 and six miRNAs were upregulated in the spleen and the lungs, respectively, all predicted to influence viral transcription, cytokine production, and lymphocyte functioning. Subsequent downregulation of NFATC3, NFAT5, SPPL3, and TGFB2 genes in particular was observed only in the spleen, demonstrating the biological functionality of the miRNAs in this lymphoid organ. This is the first study that describes the modulation of miRNAs and the related host immune factors by IBV in chicken embryos. Our data provide novel insight into complex virus-host interactions and specifically highlight components that could affect the host's immune response to IBV infection.","Kemp, Vera; Laconi, Andrea; Cocciolo, Giulio; Berends, Alinda J; Breit, Timo M; Verheije, M Hélène",Arch Virol,,67

METHODS: The Alzheimer's Association and representatives from more than 30 countries-with technical guidance from the World Health Organization-have formed an international consortium to study the short-and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias. This consortium will link teams from around the world covering more than 22 million COVID-19 cases to enroll two groups of individuals including people with disease, to be evaluated for follow-up evaluations at 6, 9, and 18 months, and people who are already enrolled in existing international research studies to add additional measures and markers of their underlying biology. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing evidence and understanding of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the CNS raises key questions on the impact for risk of later life cognitive decline, AD, and other dementia. This program of studies aims to better understand the long-term consequences that may impact the brain, cognition, and functioning-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias.","de Erausquin, Gabriel A; Snyder, Heather; Carrillo, María; Hosseini, Akram A; Brugha, Traolach S; Seshadri, Sudha",Alzheimers dememt,,67

While the infection with human CoV is commonly associated with mild respiratory symptoms, the emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the potential for CoVs to cause severe respiratory and systemic disease. The devastating global health burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spawned countless studies seeking clinical correlates of disease severity and host susceptibility factors, revealing a complex network of antiviral immune circuits. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is, like SARS-CoV-2, a beta-CoV and is endemic in wild mice. Laboratory MHV strains have been extensively studied to reveal coronavirus virulence factors and elucidate host mechanisms of antiviral immunity. These are reviewed here with the aim to identify translational insights for SARS-CoV-2 learned from murine CoVs.","Grabherr, Sarah; Ludewig, Burkhard; Pikor, Natalia Barbara",Eur J Immunol,,67

The reference standard for diagnosis is a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, but results are not immediate and sensibility is variable. AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest X-ray for COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective analysis of symptomatic patients admitted into one primary care centre in Spain between March and September 2020. METHOD: Patients' chest X-rays and lung ultrasounds were categorized as normal or pathologic. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Pathologic lung ultrasound images were further categorized as showing either local or diffuse interstitial disease. McNemar and Fisher tests were used to compare diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Most of the 212 patients presented fever at admission, either as a standalone symptom (37.74% of patients) or together with others (72.17% of patients). The positive predictive value of the lung ultrasound was 90% for the diffuse interstitial pattern and 46.92% for local pattern. The lung ultrasound had a significantly higher sensitivity (82.75%) (p < 0.001), but lower specificity (71%) than the chest X-ray (54.02% and 86%, respectively) (p = 0.008) for identifying interstitial lung disease. Moreover, sensitivity of the lung ultrasound for severe interstitial disease was 100%, and was significantly higher than the chest X-ray (58.33%) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The lung ultrasound is more accurate than the chest X-ray for identifying patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and it is especially useful for those presenting diffuse interstitial disease.","Martínez Redondo, Javier; Comas Rodríguez, Carles; Pujol Salud, Jesús; Crespo Pons, Montserrat; García Serrano, Cristina; Ortega Bravo, Marta; Palacín Peruga, Jose María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,67

In a broad sense, new mobility services (NMS) can be characterized as a way of optimizing the ownership and use of a variety of mobility resources, tailored to the needs of an entire (urban) community. In this context, providing an up-to-date and critical review on the impact of NMS is the main contribution and added value of this study. To this end, this study presents an in-depth review of NMS and their diverse features (e.g., car sharing, bike sharing, Mobihubs, etc.), as an alternative to privately-owned travel modes. By reviewing more than 100 relevant sources from academic journals (Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science) and media reports, this study explains the key elements on how to address the impact assessment of NMS in terms of social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainable mobility services. This study concludes that the implementation of NMS offers the potential to promote efficiency, sustainability, social equity, and quality of life.

Stem-cell therapy has held considerable promise for decades in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders because of its unique capacity for tissue repair and functional integrity. Currently, there is growing interest in using stem cells as a novel option to attenuate the adverse effects of irradiation. In the present review, we discuss recent studies evaluating stem-cell therapies for the irradiated brain and their therapeutic effects on ameliorating radiation-related brain injury as well as their potential challenges in clinical applications.

RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included. Of these, 16 examined the impact on acute coronary syndromes (ACS), eight on strokes, one on ACS and strokes, and 2 on other types of CVD. When comparing the COVID-19 period to non-COVID-19 periods, eleven studies observed a decrease in ACS admissions ranging between 40 and 50% and five studies showed a decrease in stroke admissions of between 12 and 40%. Four studies showed a larger reduction in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) compared to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI). A decrease in the number of reperfusion procedures, a shortening in the lengths of stay at the hospital, and longer symptom-to-door times were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in the rate of admissions for acute CVD, reductions in the number of procedures, shortened lengths of stay at the hospital and longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment. The impact on patient's prognosis needs to be quantified in future studies.","Kiss, Pauline; Carcel, Cheryl; Hockham, Carinna; Peters, Sanne A E",Eur. Heart J. Qual. Care Clin. Outcomes,,67

When discharging COVID-19 patients in accordance with throat or nasal swab protocols using RT-PCR, the potential risk of reintroducing the infection source to humans and the environment must be resolved. Here, 14 patients including 10 COVID-19 subjects were recruited; exhaled breath condensate (EBC), air samples and surface swabs were collected and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in four hospitals with applied natural ventilation and disinfection practices in Wuhan. Here we discovered that 22.2% of COVID-19 patients (n = 9), who were ready for hospital discharge based on current guidelines, had SARS-CoV-2 in their exhaled breath (~105 RNA copies/m3). Although fewer surface swabs (3.1%, n = 318) tested positive, medical equipment such as face shield frequently contacted/used by healthcare workers and the work shift floor were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 (3-8 viruses/cm2). Three of the air samples (n = 44) including those collected using a robot-assisted sampler were detected positive by a digital PCR with a concentration level of 9-219 viruses/m3. RT-PCR diagnosis using throat swab specimens had a failure rate of more than 22% in safely discharging COVID-19 patients who were otherwise still exhaling the SARS-CoV-2 by a rate of estimated ~1400 RNA copies per minute into the air. Direct surface contact might not represent a major transmission route, and lower positive rate of air sample (6.8%) was likely due to natural ventilation (1.6-3.3 m/s) and regular disinfection practices. While there is a critical need for strengthening hospital discharge standards in preventing re-emergence of COVID-19 spread, use of breath sample as a supplement specimen could further guard the hospital discharge to ensure the safety of the public and minimize the pandemic re-emergence risk.","Zhou, Lian; Yao, Maosheng; Zhang, Xiang; Hu, Bicheng; Li, Xinyue; Chen, Haoxuan; Zhang, Lu; Liu, Yun; Du, Meng; Sun, Bochao; Jiang, Yunyu; Zhou, Kai; Hong, Jie; Yu, Na; Ding, Zhen; Xu, Yan; Hu, Min; Morawska, Lidia; Grinshpun, Sergey A; Biswas, Pratim; Flagan, Richard C; Zhu, Baoli; Liu, Wenqing; Zhang, Yuanhang",J Aerosol Sci,,67

This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; pp = 0.024),.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, the mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas the eosinophil count and platelet distribution width levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among influenza patients. In the diagnosis of COVID-19, the platelet count and platelet indices are easily accessible, inexpensive, and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter.","Ozcelik, Neslihan; Ozyurt, Songul; Yilmaz Kara, Bilge; Gumus, Aziz; Sahin, Unal",J. med. virol,,67

371196,"Social consequences of COVID-19 in a low resource setting in Sierra Leone, West Africa",2020,"PURPOSE: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) scans plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. METHODS: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, for example, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. RESULTS: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pretrained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We achieve average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3%, 97.7%, and 67.3% and average normalized surface dice (NSD) scores of 90.6%, 91.4%, and 70.0% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation, and the largest number of pretrained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.","Ma, Jun; Wang, Yixin; An, Xingle; Ge, Cheng; Yu, Ziqi; Chen, Jianan; Zhu, Qiongjie; Dong, Guoqiang; He, Jian; He, Zhiqiang; Cao, Tianjia; Zhu, Yuntao; Nie, Ziwei; Yang, Xiaoping",Med Phys,,67

Globally, there has been a rapid proliferation of research studies and clinical trials assessing risks, infectivity and treatment. METHODS: This review assesses the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region to engage in the conduct of high quality clinical trials during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Opportunities are abundant for conducting clinical trials in MENA countries, including substantial cost savings, academic health centers, integrated health information systems, international accreditation, and international collaborations. Yet, the MENA region has missed out on opportunities to advance patient research during prior infectious disease outbreaks caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, as evidenced by the lack of concerted research and clinical trials from the region. A large vulnerable population, especially the poor expatriate work force, the current isolation of the health centers, and the lack of an expert network or field trained task force, all contribute to challenges preventing the formation of a pan Arab research enterprise for epidemics. CONCLUSION: Quality clinical research is critical during public health emergencies to identify treatments and solutions. The efficient conduct of clinical trials requires innovative strategies in research design, approval, and dissemination. Many countries in the MENA region have an opportunity to quickly ramp up research capacity and contribute significantly to the fight against the Covid-19 global threat.","Ibrahim, Halah; Kamour, Ashraf M; Harhara, Thana; Gaba, Waqar H; Nair, Satish C",Contemp Clin Trials,,67

We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents' activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.","El Haj, Mohamad; Altintas, Emin; Chapelet, Guillaume; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; Gallouj, Karim",Psychiatry Res,,67

In particular, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), LTCFs that provide skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services for persons with complex medical needs, have been documented settings of COVID-19 outbreaks (3). In addition, residents of LTCFs might be at increased risk for severe outcomes because of their advanced age or the presence of underlying chronic medical conditions (4). As a result, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that residents and staff members of LTCFs be offered vaccination in the initial COVID-19 vaccine allocation phase (Phase 1a) in the United States (5). In December 2020, CDC launched the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program* to facilitate on-site vaccination of residents and staff members at enrolled LTCFs.

The objective of this study was to describe the association between neighborhood factors and number of COVID-19 cases. We hypothesized an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and clusters of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We analyzed data on patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston during February 5-May 4, 2020. We used a bivariate local join-count procedure to determine colocation between census tracts with high rates of neighborhood demographic characteristics (eg, Hispanic race/ethnicity) and measures of disadvantage (eg, health insurance status) and COVID-19 cases. We used negative binomial models to assess independent associations between neighborhood factors and the incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 9898 COVID-19 patients were in the cohort. The overall crude incidence in the study area was 32 cases per 10 000 population, and the adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2 to 405 per 10 000 population. We found significant colocation of several neighborhood factors and the top quintile of cases: percentage of population that was Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, without health insurance, receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and living in poverty. Factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 included percentage of population that is Hispanic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and percentage of households living in poverty (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant association between neighborhoods with high rates of disadvantage and COVID-19. Policy makers need to consider these health inequities when responding to the pandemic and planning for subsequent health needs.","Samuels-Kalow, Margaret E; Dorner, Stephen; Cash, Rebecca E; Dutta, Sayon; White, Benjamin; Ciccolo, Gia E; Brown, David F M; Camargo, Carlos A",Public Health Rep,,67

One solution is to perform remote testing using crowdsourcing; however, because we cannot control the listening conditions, it is unclear whether the results are entirely reliable. In this study, we compared speech intelligibility scores obtained in remote and laboratory experiments. The results showed that the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the remote experiments' speech reception threshold (SRT) were higher than those of the laboratory experiments. However, the variance in the SRTs across the speech-enhancement conditions revealed similarities, implying that remote testing results may be as useful as laboratory experiments to develop an objective measure. We also show that the practice session scores correlate with the SRT values. This is a priori information before performing the main tests and would be useful for data screening to reduce the variability of the SRT distribution.","Yamamoto, Ayako; Irino, Toshio; Arai, Kenichi; Araki, Shoko; Ogawa, Atsunori; Kinoshita, Keisuke; Nakatani, Tomohiro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10001v1.pdf,67

Consequently, there have been efforts to ensure that tourism contributes to the host communities to address some of the sustainability challenges through responsible and sustainable tourism initiatives in the recent past. With less than nine years to go before the lapse of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is a need to take stock of how tourism enterprises such as national parks are contributing to the SDGs. This study examines how Kruger National Parks (KNP) is assisting the host communities in meeting the SDG goals and targets. The study made use of 30 in-depth key informant interviews, field observations and critical document analysis. The study found that regardless of the challenges it faces as an organization in partnering with host communities for developmental purposes, Kruger National Park has assisted communities to meet at least 15 out of the 17 SDGs. These span from social to economic, environmental and cultural SDGs. Since KNP’s projects address host community needs, several challenges need to be dealt with to ensure the sustainability of these projects post COVID-19 pandemic, which has undermined many nature tourism establishments worldwide. Besides the pandemic, there is a need to manage community expectations with regard to how far it can address some of the challenges faced by communities.","Mashudu, Andra Mabibibi Thwala Konanani",Sustainability,,67

The changes in the column averages are substantial in a few places of the model global grid, but the induced gradients are most often less than the random errors of the retrievals. The current necessity to restrict the quality-assured column retrievals to almost cloud-free areas appears to be a major obstacle in identifying changes in CO2 emissions. Indeed, large changes have occurred in the presence of clouds and, in places that were cloud-free in 2020, the comparison with previous years is hampered by different cloud conditions during these years. We therefore recommend to favor all-weather CO2 monitoring systems, at least in situ, to support international efforts to reduce emissions.","Chevallier, Frédéric; Zheng, Bo; Broquet, Grégoire; Ciais, Philippe; Liu, Zhu; Davis, Steven J; Deng, Zhu; Wang, Yilong; Bréon, François-Marie; O039,; Dell, Christopher W",Geophys Res Lett,,67

This study examined change in mental health from before to during the pandemic among predominantly Hispanic/Latinx adolescents. METHOD: 322 young adolescents (Mage = 11.99, 55% female), with a racial/ethnic composition of 72.7% Hispanic/Latinx, 9.3% Black or African American, 5.9% Multiple Races, 5.0% Asian, 1.6% White, and 1.2% American Indian, completed a mental health screening measure prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and at three points during the pandemic. A subsample also completed a survey about their experience at home during COVID-19. Repeated measures mixed ANCOVA was used to evaluate change in each mental health domain, and whether youth who had elevated symptoms at baseline differed in their level of change, controlling for age and gender. RESULTS: For youth who had elevated levels of mental health problems pre-pandemic, symptoms were significantly reduced across domains during the pandemic. Reductions in internalizing, externalizing, and total problems were clinically significant. For other youth, there were statistically significant reductions in internalizing and total problems, and no change in attention or externalizing problems. Post-hoc analyses revealed that better family functioning was consistently related to lower mental health symptoms in youth during COVID-19 follow-ups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations may offer protective effects for youth mental health. Study results may be specific to this population of predominantly Hispanic/Latinx youth from a large city in the southwestern US.","Penner, Francesca; Ortiz, Jessica Hernandez; Sharp, Carla",J. Am.

395312,Coronavirus disease 2019 in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient living with human immunodeficiency virus,2020,"There is accumulating evidence showing that exercise therapy may play an active role in peripheral neuropathic pain (NP), but its mechanism is still unclear. Studies have found that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in NP by regulating pain-related target genes. Therefore, we aimed to explore the changes of miRNA and mRNA of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after NP in response to exercise with transcriptome technology. The chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was established, and rats were randomly allocated into three groups, namely, the sham-operated, CCI, and CCI-exercised groups. L4-L6 DRG tissue was taken for RNA-sequencing, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined through bioinformatics analysis. Real-time PCR was used to confirm the accuracy. A total of 4 overlapping differentially expressed miRNAs and 186 overlapping differentially expressed mRNAs were identified in the two comparisons of the sham-operated group versus the CCI group and the CCI group versus the CCI-exercised group. Among these DEGs, miR-145-5p, miR-341, miR-300-5p, miR-653-5p, Atf3, Cacna2d1, Gal, and Ctss related to NP were validated by real-time PCR. DEGs between the CCI and CCI-exercised groups were enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. This study provides an understanding of the adaptive mechanisms after exercise of NP, and these DEGs in DRG might play a role in NP by stimulating the enriched pathways.","Guo, Jia-Bao; Chen, Bing-Lin; Song, Ge; Zheng, Yi-Li; Zhu, Yi; Yang, Zheng; Su, Xuan; Wang, Ying; Cao, Qing; Chen, Pei-Jie; Wang, Xue-Qiang",Neural Plast,,67

397839,Thrombosis and COVID-19: Controversies and (Tentative) Conclusions,2021,"BACKGROUND: In order to protect dental teams and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists have had to adopt several measures (operating and post-operating procedures) which may increase the total treatment time and costs relating to individual protective measures. This paper will propose a thorough analysis of operating dentistry procedures, comparing the economic performance of the activity in a dental surgery before and after the adoption of these protective measures, which are required to contain the risk of SARS-COV-2 infections. METHODS: The economic analysis is articulated in three approaches. Firstly, it assesses a reduction in markup by maintaining current charges (A); alternatively, it suggests revised charges to adopt in order to maintain unvaried levels of markup (B). And the third Approach (C) examines available dental treatments, highlighting how to profitably combine treatment volumes to reduce markup loss or a restricted increase in dental charges. RESULTS: Maintaining dental charges could cause a loss in markup, even rising to 200% (A); attempting to maintain unvaried levels of markup will result in an increase in dental charges, even at 100% (B); and varying the volumes of the single dental treatments on offer (increasing those which current research indicates as the most profitable) could mitigate the economic impact of the measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-COV-2 (C). CONCLUSIONS: The authors of this paper provide managerial insights which can assist the dentist-entrepreneur to become aware of the boundaries of the economic consequences of governmental measures in containing the virus infection.","Lo Nigro, Giovanna; Bizzoca, Maria Eleonora; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo; Campisi, Giuseppina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,67

402137,Paradoxes and uncertainties of immunomodulatory treatments in the fight against COVID-19,2020,"Introduction An international reform on anatomy education has witnessed a transition from traditional cadaveric teaching, often reliant on rote-learning, toward visualization-based learning approaches. Multimodality of the learning preferences of Generation Z and the steep threshold learning curve in anatomy has led to the conception of gamification as a means of improving anatomy engagement, with reference to the Ebbinghaus (1880) forgetting curve. The aim of this study was to quantify student engagement using Quitch?, a gamified mobile learning platform and assess the impact of the app on student academic performance in an undergraduate Musculoskeletal Anatomy unit. Method 157 students enrolled in undergraduate Health and Science degrees at Swinburne University Australia were invited to download Quitch? during the COVID-19 remote learning period. In a student-faculty partnership project, a Quitch? unit with learning modules segregated for six regional anatomy topics, featuring 12 sections, was developed for Musculoskeletal Anatomy by 3rd year past students. Engagement was quantified using a 4-stage ordinal scale (1-4), based on access time from quiz release. The correlation between engagement, retention and academic performance for two virtual ?spotter? examinations was analysed. Results Preliminary results indicate that ?highly engaged? students who completed the quizzes within 14 days, quantified with a mode ordinal score of 1, scored an average grade of 67.05±0.18% on virtual spotter examinations;21.37% higher than those who did not engage with Quitch?. Students who did not attempt the majority of quizzes (63.92%), quantified with an ordinal score of 4, received an average of 45.68±0.22% in their examinations. Completion and accuracy data from the Quitch? leaderboard indicated that the top 20 users received an average grade of 77.50%, in comparison to 49.86% for students with low engagement. Student retention increased from 88.7% in 2019 to 96.7% in 2020;while 79% of students reported an ?increased sense of belonging'in the unit. Conclusion Quitch? offers personalized learning capabilities, mobility with notification capacity, tracking of at-risk students and allows the delivery of high-quality case-based, radiology and virtual spotter questions. We showcase the accommodation of multimodal learning preferences of students through content co-creation by students-as-partners in a platform that uses competitive leaderboards and badges to improve student engagement. Our analytics validate the efficacy of spaced repetition to consolidate long-term retention for improved performance in practical examinations.

In France, most of the university courses for the year 2020 had to be delivered at distance. This can be an opportunity for some to rethink the place and the form of distance learning (DL). We present here the feedback of students about DL, who answered a questionnaire about classes they followed between October and December 2020. In addition, we evaluated the use and utility of an audience response system promoting interaction. Our results showed that overall the organization and internet connections allowed DL to run smoothly. Interestingly, all students were in favor of the development of a mixed solution, with distant lectures and face-to-face practical lessons. Finally, the use of interactive software such as Wooclap? has proven to be easy to use and to develop for all lessons.","Marin, Julie Brichler Ségolène Lecuyer Hervé Carbonnelle Etienne Lescat Mathilde",Journal of Educational Technology Systems,,67

405497,Controlling the COVID-19 Pandemic Blindly: Silent Spread in Absence of Rapid Viral Screening,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","Meinert, Edward; Milne-Ives, Madison; Surodina, Svitlana; Lam, Ching",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,67

Compared with adult patients, elderly patients have not received enough attention. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the clinical characteristics of elder patients with COVID-19. Methods: A deep literature search was performed in the databases through August 21, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using analysis models. Results: Three studies including 2046 infected patients were precisely evaluated, and the results show that the elderly group has a higher risk of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the younger patients. Their total white blood cells are higher than that of the younger patients, and their lymphocytes are relatively reduced compared with the younger patients. Conclusion: We comprehensively assessed the clinical characteristics of patients of different ages with COVID-19 and found that elder patients had a high risk of chronic cardiovascular and metabolism comorbidities. The characteristic clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of elderly patients support their excessive inflammation and weak immune defenses against 2019-nCoV. All these findings provide important information for understanding the general clinical characterization of the aging immune defense against the virus and enhancing the public awareness of the prevention and treatment of elder patients in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yifan, Chen; Jun, Pu",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,67

We demonstrate that limited phenotypic data and exposure/infection information in the early stages of the pandemic significantly impact the ability to detect most genetic variants with moderate effect sizes, especially when studying susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our insights can aid in the interpretation of genetic findings emerging in the literature and guide the design of future host genetic studies.","Lin, Yu-Chung; Brooks, Jennifer D; Bull, Shelley B; Gagnon, France; Greenwood, Celia M T; Hung, Rayjean J; Lawless, Jerald; Paterson, Andrew D; Sun, Lei; Strug, Lisa J",Genome Med,,67
414763,Lessons From COVID-19 in Children: Key Hypotheses to Guide Preventative and Therapeutic Strategies,2020,"Introduction: There are currently no specific drugs and universal vaccines for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hence urgent effective measures are needed to discover and develop therapeutic agents. Applying peptide therapeutics and their related compounds is a promising strategy to achieve this goal. This review is written based on the literature search using several databases, previous studies, scientific reports, our current knowledge about the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and our personal analyses on the potential of the antiviral peptides for the treatment of COVID-19.Areas covered: In this review, we begin with a brief description of SARS-CoV2 followed by a comprehensive description of antiviral peptides (AVPs) including natural and synthetic AMPs or AVPs and peptidomimetics. Subsequently, the structural features, mechanisms of action, limitations, and therapeutic applications of these peptides are explained.Expert opinion: Regarding the lack and the limitations of drugs against COVID-19, AMPs, AVPs, and other peptide-like compounds such as peptidomimetics have captured the attention of researchers due to their potential antiviral activities. Some of these compounds comprise unique properties and have demonstrated the potential to fight SARS-CoV2, particularly melittin, lactoferrin, enfuvirtide, and rupintrivir that have the potential to enter animal and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.","Mousavi Maleki, Masoumeh Sadat; Rostamian, Mosayeb; Madanchi, Hamid",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,67

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the global point estimate of deaths and risk factors for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched up to August 1, 2020. Pooled prevalence of participant characteristics, clinical features, and outcome data was calculated with the use of random effects models. Subgroup analyses were based on geographic distribution, study type, quality assessment, sample size, end date, and patient disposition. RESULTS: Forty-five studies with 16,561 patients from 17 countries across four continents were included. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs had a mean age of 62.6 years (95% CI, 60.4-64.7). Common comorbidities included hypertension (49.5%; 95% CI, 44.9-54.0) and diabetes mellitus (26.6%; 95% CI, 22.7-30.8). More than three-quarters of cases experienced the development of ARDS (76.1%; 95% CI, 65.7-85.2). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1-75.7) of case, vasopressor support in 65.9% (95% CI, 52.4-78.4) of cases, renal replacement therapy in 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-22.2) of cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 6.4% (95% CI, 4.1-9.1) of cases. The duration of ICU and hospital admission was 10.8 days (95% CI, 9.3-18.4) and 19.1 days (95% CI, 16.3-21.9), respectively, with in-hospital mortality rate of 28.1% (95% CI, 23.4-33.0; I2 = 96%). No significant subgroup effect was observed. INTERPRETATION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to the ICU require substantial organ support and prolonged ICU and hospital level care.

The functional role of these maternal microchimeric cells (MMc) in the offspring is mostly unknown. Here we show a mouse model in which MMc numbers are either normal or low, which enables functional assessment of MMc. We report a functional role of MMc in promoting fetal immune development. MMc induces preferential differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in fetal bone marrow towards monocytes within the myeloid compartment. Neonatal mice with higher numbers of MMc and monocytes show enhanced resilience against cytomegalovirus infection. Similarly, higher numbers of MMc in human cord blood are linked to a lower number of respiratory infections during the first year of life. Our data highlight the importance of MMc in promoting fetal immune development, potentially averting the threats caused by early life exposure to pathogens.","Stelzer, Ina Annelies; Urbschat, Christopher; Schepanski, Steven; Thiele, Kristin; Triviai, Ioanna; Wieczorek, Agnes; Alawi, Malik; Ohnezeit, Denise; Kottlau, Julian; Huang, Jiabin; Fischer, Nicole; Mittrücker, Hans-Willi; Solano, Maria Emilia; Fehse, Boris; Diemert, Anke; Stahl, Felix R; Arck, Petra Clara",Nat Commun,,67
415776,Psychological distress among infectious disease physicians during the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the republic of korea,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social networks are taking over teenagers' lives and altering the way they relate to others. They are creating their own and changing culture. Which is a cause for concern for adults, who do not understand it. Moreover, usage peaks at a pivotal time in life: adolescence. Therefore it seems important to understand these new habits, and the reasons why social networks are such an important part of the life of adolescents. Furthermore, we looked into the question if virtual relationships have an impact on real-life relationships, and vice versa. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This literature review examined studies published between 2008 and September 2019. Twenty-five articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases. RESULTS: Above all, teenagers are motivated to use social networks because they can develop an identity based on an idealized profile. This profile must be at least as good as those of their peers, in order to obtain the latter's approval. This is notably the case in a context where changes to the family structure give a greater weight to the opinion of peers. Young people are driven to seek refuge on the Internet by a lack of family support, and parents who are less emotionally present. This effect could be limited by encouraging communication between teenagers and their parents. Finally, romantic relationships are impacted by the availability of pornography. Viewing pornography is increasingly seen as a normal stage of development and is linked to poorer attachment to peers and family. CONCLUSIONS: The Internet seems to support a gradual detachment from family life and a move towards greater inclusion in the peer group. This is all the more evident in a context where family structures are changing.","Jassogne, Carole; Zdanowicz, Nicolas",Psychiatr Danub,,67
417032,How Are Emerging Data Translated Into Clinical Practice? A Mixed Methods Investigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Institutional Treatment Protocols,2021,"PURPOSE: Differentiating COVID-19 from other acute infectious pneumonias rapidly is challenging at present. This study aims to improve the diagnosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT). METHOD: COVID-19 was confirmed mainly by virus nucleic acid testing and epidemiological history according to WHO interim guidance, while other infectious pneumonias were diagnosed by antigen testing. The texture features were extracted from CT images by two radiologists with 5 years of work experience using modified wavelet transform and matrix computation analyses. The random forest (RF) classifier was applied to identify COVID-19 patients and images. RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 95 individuals (291 images) with COVID-19 and 96 individuals (279 images) with other acute infectious pneumonias, including 50 individuals (160 images) with influenza A/B. In total, 6 texture features showed a positive association with COVID-19, while 4 features were negatively associated. The mean AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of the 5-fold test sets were 0.800, 0.722, 0.770, and 0.680 for image classification and 0.858, 0.826, 0.809, and 0.842 for individual classification, respectively. The feature 'Correlation' contributed most both at the image level and individual level, even compared with the clinical factors. In addition, the texture features could discriminate COVID-19 from influenza A/B, with an AUROC of 0.883 for images and 0.957 for individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The developed texture feature-based RF classifier could assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19, which could be a rapid screening tool in the era of pandemic.","Wu, Zhiyuan; Li, Li; Jin, Ronghua; Liang, Lianchun; Hu, Zhongjie; Tao, Lixin; Han, Yong; Feng, Wei; Zhou, Di; Li, Weiming; Lu, Qinbin; Liu, Wei; Fang, Liqun; Huang, Jian; Gu, Yu; Li, Hongjun; Guo, Xiuhua",Eur J Radiol,,67

Herein, we developed an innovative assay for the determination of COVID-19 seroconversion. Fluorophore-labeled SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain recombinant protein (F-RBD) was discovered to operate as a bioprobe that emits a strong fluorescence upon COVID-19 antibody detection; however, F-RBD fluorescence was deactivated by graphene oxide-decorated surfaces when COVID-19 antibodies are absent in the sample. With a cost of less than 0.5 USD per test (at laboratory scale), the biosensing system offers optimum results within 42 min.

419968,Host Immune Response and Immunobiology of Human SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"In a special issue that focuses on complex presentations related to Autism, we ask the question in this editorial whether an Autism Spectrum Condition without complexity is a disorder, or whether it represents human diversity? Much research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism Spectrum Conditions. These comparisons have tended to draw attention to 'deficits' in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are characterised as unwanted. Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association. Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability. Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences. We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively. Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Wright, Barry; Spikins, Penny; Pearson, Hannah",Medicina (Kaunas),,67

423322,A case of rapidly progressive upper limb ischemic necrosis in a patient with COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on the nursing homes for dependent older people. The difficulty of management of this crisis is aggravated by the frailty of the people served and by the specific characteristics of the care area, mainly the fact of not being integrated into the health system. The objective of this work is to describe the pharmaceutical care developed by a hospital pharmacy service established in a nursing home and, from a more global perspective, analyze the strengths and weaknesses found from the various experiences of hospital pharmacy in all spanish autonomous communities to deal with this pandemic. Specialized pharmaceutical care has provided rigor in the validation and treatments review processes from a comprehensive perspective, maximizing safety and collaborating in the establishment of the therapeutic intensity degree most appropriate to the individual situation, has ensured the availability of all necessary medications, has collaborated in the acquisition and management of personal protective equipment, has been able to adapt the dispensation processes to the internal nursing homes sectorization and has facilitated the coordination between the nursing home and the health system. It is clear that the crisis casued by COVID- 19 has put relevance of the need to integrate the social-health level into the health system. And also, the contribution of specialized pharmaceutical care in improving healthcare coverage and coordination with health services has highlighted the urgency of developing the current legislation, prioritizing the establishment of pharmacy services able to provid specialized and specific care for this area, so that it meets healthcare needs and is integrated into the health system.","Peris-Martí, Juan F; Bravo-José, Patricia; Sáez-Lleó, Carmen; Fernández-Villalba, Elia",Farm Hosp,,67

The larger the size (or number of VWF multimers), the greater the functionality of the protein. A deficiency or defect of VWF can lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD) and cause bleeding. Conversely, an increase in VWF may create an environment that promotes thrombosis. ADAMS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), sometimes called VWF-cleaving protease, is primarily responsible for controlling the size of VWF. The most severe deficiency (<10% of normal levels) of ADAMTS-13 arises in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition characterized by the presence of ultralarge VWF and clinically resulting in enhanced risk of thrombosis. However, ADAMTS-13 deficiency may result from other pathological processes. Of relevance is the recent finding that COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with both increased levels and activity of VWF as well as generally decreased (or occasionally normal) activity levels of ADAMTS-13. Thus, in COVID-19 there is an alteration in the VWF/ADAMTS-13 axis, most often described by increased VWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio (or reduced ADAMTS-13/VWF ratio). COVID-19 is also associated with high prothrombotic risk. Thus, the imbalance of VWF and ADAMTS-13 in COVID-19 may be providing a milieu that promotes (micro)thrombosis, in a clinical picture resembling a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in some patients. This review therefore assesses the literature on VWF, ADAMTS-13, and COVID-19.

The pulmonary infection can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ultimately, death. An excessive innate immune response plays a major role in the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In this scenario, activation of lung epithelia and resident macrophages by the virus results in local cytokine production and recruitment of neutrophils. Activated neutrophils extrude a web of DNA-based cytoplasmic material containing antimicrobials referred to as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). While NETs are a defensive strategy against invading microbes, they can also serve as a nidus for accumulation of activated platelets and coagulation factors, forming thrombi. This immunothrombosis can result in occlusion of blood vessels leading to ischemic damage. Herein we address evidence in favor of a lung-centric immunothrombosis and suggest a lung-centric therapeutic approach to the ARDS of COVID-19.","Kvietys, Peter R; Fakhoury, Hana M A; Kadan, Sana; Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Al-Mutairy, Eid; Al-Kattan, Khaled",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,67

Yet much less is known about the implications for suppliers operating in regional value chains (RVCs) in the global South. In this article, we focus on Eswatini, which has grown to become the largest African manufacturer and exporter of apparel to the region. We draw on a combination of firm-level export data and interviews with stakeholders before and after the Covid-19 lockdown to shed light on the influence of private and public governance on suppliers' economic and social upgrading and downgrading. We point to the coexistence of two separate private governance structures: the first characterised by direct contracts between South African retailers and large manufacturers (direct suppliers); the second operating through indirect purchasing via intermediaries from relatively smaller producers (indirect suppliers). While direct suppliers enjoyed higher levels of economic and social upgrading than indirect suppliers before Covid-19, the pandemic reinforced this division, with severe price cuts for indirect suppliers. Furthermore, while retailers provided some direct suppliers with support throughout the crisis, this was not the case for indirect suppliers, who remain comparatively more vulnerable. In terms of public governance, the negative consequences of the lockdown on firms' income and workers' livelihoods have been compounded by the state's ineffective response. Our paper contributes to the research on RVCs in the global South, enhancing our understanding of how different governance structures and external shocks affect firms' and workers' upgrading and downgrading prospects.","Pasquali, Giovanni; Godfrey, Shane",Eur J Dev Res,,67

To contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine, countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in Istanbul, Turkey, through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. The paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents' self- regulation and governmental measures, distinguishing travel for commute, Social/Recreational/Leisure (SRL), and shopping activities, as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. Due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5â¯m, closure of numerous non-essential venues, encouraging teleworking and distance education, job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in Istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection, the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme, particularly for commuting and SRL trips.","Shakibaei, Shahin; de Jong, Gerard C; Alpkökin, Pelin; Rashidi, Taha H",Sustain Cities Soc,,67

To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction, and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals, including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens.","Welch, Stephen R; Davies, Katherine A; Buczkowski, Hubert; Hettiarachchi, Nipunadi; Green, Nicole; Arnold, Ulrike; Jones, Matthew; Hannah, Matthew J; Evans, Reah; Burton, Christopher; Burton, Jane E; Guiver, Malcolm; Cane, Patricia A; Woodford, Neil; Bruce, Christine B; Roberts, Allen D G; Killip, Marian J",J. clin. microbiol,,67

It finds applications from physics and chemistry to engineering, life and medical science. In the last decade, the approach has begun to advance from being a computer-based means of rationalising experimental observations, to producing apparently credible predictions for a number of real-world applications within industrial sectors such as advanced materials and drug discovery. However, key aspects concerning the reproducibility of the method have not kept pace with the speed of its uptake in the scientific community. Here, we present a discussion of uncertainty quantification for molecular dynamics simulation designed to endow the method with better error estimates that will enable the method to be used to report actionable results. The approach adopted is a standard one in the field of uncertainty quantification, namely using ensemble methods, in which a sufficiently large number of replicas are run concurrently, from which reliable statistics can be extracted. Indeed, because molecular dynamics is intrinsically chaotic, the need to use ensemble methods is fundamental and holds regardless of the duration of the simulations performed. We discuss the approach and illustrate it in a range of applications from materials science to ligand-protein binding free energy estimation.","Wan, Shunzhou; Sinclair, Robert C.; Coveney, Peter V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07104v2.pdf,67

PARTICIPANTS: 3-D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observed fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at aspecific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Activation of the microdebrider in the presence of excess fluid in the nasal cavity (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive irrigation fluid or bleeding) resulted in detectable droplet spread. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burs resulted in detectable droplets and greater spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP but the addition of suction using a third hand technique reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity. Using the instrument outside the nasal cavity inadvertently, or when unblocking, produces greater droplet spread and requires more caution.","Leong, Samuel C; Mogre, Dilesh; Andrews, Peter; Davies, Elgan",Clin. otolaryngol,,67

446067,Building better tuberculosis control systems in a post-COVID world: learning from Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"l-Lysine oxidase (LysOX) is a FAD-dependent homo-dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l-lysine to produce &#945;-keto-Îµ-aminocaproate with ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. LysOX shows strict substrate specificity for l-lysine, whereas most l-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) exhibit broad substrate specificity for l-amino acids. Previous studies of LysOX showed that overall structural similarity to the well-studied snake venom LAAOs. However, the molecular mechanism of strict specificity for l-lysine was still unclear. We here determined the structure of LysOX in complex with l-lysine at 1.7 å resolution. The structure revealed that the hydrogen bonding network formed by D212, D315, and A440 with two water molecules is responsible for the recognition of the side chain amino group. In addition, a narrow hole formed by five hydrophobic residues in the active site contributes to strict substrate specificity. Mutation studies demonstrated that D212 and D315 are essential for l-lysine recognition, and the D212A/D315A double mutant LysOX showed different substrate specificity from LysOX. Moreover, the structural basis of the substrate specificity change has also been revealed by the structural analysis of the mutant variant and its substrate complexes. These results clearly explain the molecular mechanism of the strict specificity of LysOX and suggest that LysOX is a potential candidate for a template to design LAAOs specific to other l-amino acids.","Kondo, Hiroki; Kitagawa, Masaki; Matsumoto, Yuya; Saito, Masaya; Amano, Marie; Sugiyama, Shigeru; Tamura, Takashi; Kusakabe, Hitoshi; Inagaki, Kenji; Imada, Katsumi",Protein sci,,67
446496,Asymptomatic transmission and the infection fatality risk for COVID-19: Implications for school reopening,2020,"The understanding of infectious diseases is a priority in the field of public health. This has generated the inclusion of several disciplines and tools that allow for analyzing the dissemination of infectious diseases. The aim of this manuscript is to model the spreading of a disease in a population that is registered in a database. From this database, we obtain an edge-weighted graph. The spreading was modeled with the classic SIR model. The model proposed with edge-weighted graph allows for identifying the most important variables in the dissemination of epidemics. Moreover, a deterministic approximation is provided. With database COVID-19 from a city in Chile, we analyzed our model with relationship variables between people. We obtained a graph with 3866 vertices and 6,841,470 edges. We fitted the curve of the real data and we have done some simulations on the obtained graph. Our model is adjusted to the spread of the disease. The model proposed with edge-weighted graph allows for identifying the most important variables in the dissemination of epidemics, in this case with real data of COVID-19. This valuable information allows us to also include/understand the networks of dissemination of epidemics diseases as well as the implementation of preventive measures of public health.

450007,Excess mortality from COVID-19 in an English sentinel network population,2020,"Surging dismissal of plastics into water resources results in the splintered debris generating microscopic particles called microplastics. The reduced size of microplastic makes it easier for intake by aquatic organisms resulting in amassing of noxious wastes, thereby disturbing their physiological functions. Microplastics are abundantly available and exhibit high propensity for interrelating with the ecosystem thereby disrupting the biogenic flora and fauna. About 71% of the earth surface is occupied by oceans, which holds 97% of the earth's water. The remaining 3% is present as water in ponds, streams, glaciers, ice caps, and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Microplastics can accumulate harmful pollutants from the surroundings thereby acting as transport vectors; and simultaneously can leach out chemicals (additives). Plastics in marine undergo splintering and shriveling to form micro/nanoparticles owing to the mechanical and photochemical processes accelerated by waves and sunlight, respectively. Microplastics differ in color and density, considering the type of polymers, and are generally classified according to their origins, i.e., primary and secondary. About 54.5% of microplastics floating in the ocean are polyethylene, and 16.5% are polypropylene, and the rest includes polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyester, and polyamides. Polyethylene and polypropylene due to its lower density in comparison with marine water floats and affect the oceanic surfaces while materials having higher density sink affecting seafloor. The effects of plastic debris in the water and aquatic systems from various literature and on how COVID-19 has become a reason for microplastic pollution are reviewed in this paper.","Issac, Merlin N; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,67

Furthermore, rural data are rarely centralized, precluding comparability across urban and rural regions. OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study is to assess hospitalization rates and all-cause inpatient mortality among persons with definitive COVID-19 diagnoses residing in rural and urban areas. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) examines a cohort of 573,018 patients from 27 US hospital systems presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and March 2021, of whom 117,897 were hospitalized. A sample of 450,725 hospitalized persons without COVID-19 diagnoses was identified for comparison. EXPOSURESZIP Codes provided by source hospital systems were classified by urban-rural gradient through a crosswalk to the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPrimary outcomes were hospitalization and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and mixed effects logistic regression were used to estimate 30-day survival in hospitalized patients and associations between rurality, hospitalization, and inpatient mortality while controlling for major risk factors. RESULTSRural patients were more likely to be older, white, have higher body mass index, and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 later in the pandemic compared with their urban counterparts. Rural compared with urban inhabitants had higher rates of hospitalization (23% vs. 19%) and all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients (16% vs. 11%). After adjustment for demographic and baseline differences, rural residents (both urban adjacent and non-adjacent) with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.37-1.45 and AOR 1.42, CI 1.35-1.50) and to die or be transferred to hospice (AOR 1.62, CI 1.30-1.49 and 1.38, CI 1.30-1.49), respectively. Similar differences in mortality were noted for hospitalized patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection.

452094,HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis - Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The idea of treating COVID-19 with statins is biologically plausible, although it is still controversial. The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address the association between the use of statins and risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Several electronic databases, including PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with relevant keywords up to 11 November 2020, were used to perform a systematic literature search. This study included research papers containing samples of adult COVID-19 patients who had data on statin use and recorded mortality as their outcome of interest. Risk estimates of mortality in statin users versus non-statin users were pooled across studies using inverse-variance weighted DerSimonian-Laird random-effect models. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a total of 52,122 patients were included in the final qualitative and quantitative analysis. Eight studies reported in-hospital use of statins; meanwhile, the remaining studies reported pre-admission use of statins. In-hospital use of statin was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.50-0.58, p < 0.00001; I2: 0%, p = 0.87), while pre-admission use of statin was not associated with mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.79-1.77, p = 0.415; I2: 68.6%, p = 0.013). The funnel plot for the association between the use of statins and mortality were asymmetrical. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that in-hospital use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Permana, Hikmat; Huang, Ian; Purwiga, Aga; Kusumawardhani, Nuraini Yasmin; Sihite, Teddy Arnold; Martanto, Erwan; Wisaksana, Rudi; Soetedjo, Nanny Natalia M",Pharmacol. rep,,67

A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases and intensive care at the tertiary-care Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy, issued a practical document shared with Tuscany hospitals. The rationale was to target the referral for those children at risk of requiring an intensive support, since the above mentioned hospital has the pediatric intensive care unit. Overall, 378 patients between 0 and 19 years of age were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the Tuscany region with 24 (6.3%) hospitalizations. Only three children were centralized to Meyer Children's University Hospital according to reported criteria.

453799,The Multidimensional Challenge of Treating COVID-19: Remdesivir is a Foot in the Door,2020,"As a source of revenue for the state budget and a source of energy (particularly fuel) to drive various sectors of life, the oil and gas industry plays an important role in the Indonesian economy. The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of crude oil prices on natural gas during the Covid19 Pandemic in Indonesia. The research method used is an explanatory method using the real price decomposition of crude oil introduced recently by Kilian (2009). This study develops four variables for the oil and natural gas market through a structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR). Based on the results of the analysis, hence some evidence is found that the crude oil market affects the natural gas market in Indonesia through a combination of changes in demand and not through changes in oil supply during the Covid-19 pandemic. The uncertainty of oil supply due to the Covid-19 pandemic has made the oil market shift to the natural gas market and increased the price of natural gas as the main substitute for oil. Meanwhile, changes in demand in Indonesia during the Covid19 Pandemic affected crude oil and gas prices, causing similar fluctuations in oil and gas prices. © 2021, Econjournals.

454015,Countries with similar COVID-19 vaccination rates yet divergent outcomes: are all vaccines created equal?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The real-world problems and ever-changing challenges currently confronting the future of nursing education and healthcare require a problem-based learning approach using simulation strategy. This is exacerbated by the increasing burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) and more recently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as advancing technology and changing regulations and policies. Problem-based learning is a student-centred learning strategy, where students are presented with situations drawn from practice, which can be used to bridge the theory-practice gap. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions and views of healthcare educators on how problem-based learning can be facilitated through simulation. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used. Thirteen educators from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Johannesburg, with 5 years' teaching experience, were purposively selected from the Dean's office, the Nursing Department, emergency medical care and the departments of podiatry, somatology and radiography. The participants were selected based on their extensive knowledge of problem-based learning and the use of simulation. Data were collected through in-depth, individual, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis provided six themes and 13 related sub-themes. The article focuses on the perceptions and views of educators regarding problem-based learning through simulation. RESULTS: Problem-based learning through simulation allows students to work together in teams, which demonstrates a new modus operandi and renders a holistic approach to patient care. CONCLUSION: Problem-based learning through simulation should be utilised to encourage reflective knowledge exchange. Students from various departments can learn about new innovations, creativity and develop critical thinking when solving complex health-related problems.","Matlala, Sidwell",Curationis,,67

Although the clinical symptoms mostly have been characterized, the scientific community still doesn´t know how SARS-CoV-2 successfully reaches and spreads throughout the central nervous system (CNS) inducing brain damage. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in frontal lobe sections from postmortem examination has confirmed the presence of the virus in neural tissue. This finding reveals a new direction in the search for a neurotherapeutic strategy in the COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a neuroinvasiveness context and suggest the therapeutic use of high doses of melatonin, which may favorably modulate the immune response and neuroinflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical trials elucidating the efficacy of melatonin in the prevention and clinical management in the COVID-19 patients should be actively encouraged.","Romero, Alejandro; Ramos, Eva; López-Muñoz, Francisco; Gil-Martín, Emilio; Escames, Germaine; Reiter, Russel J",Cell. mol. neurobiol,,67
456796,Mobility restrictions and COVID-19 pandemic outbreak control,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide, sorting virus genomic variants in newly established propagules of infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries or an actual selective advantage could explain the global high frequency reached by some genomic variants. Using statistical analyses, demographic reconstructions, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the globally invasive G614 spike variant i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects nor by overrepresentation in clinical samples; ii) increases the spike S1/S2 furin-like site conformational plasticity (short-range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our results support the hypothesis of a selective advantage at the basis of the spread of the G614 variant, which we suggest may be due to structural modification of the spike protein at the S1/S2 proteolytic site, and provides structural information to guide the design of variant-specific drugs.","Trucchi, Emiliano; Gratton, Paolo; Mafessoni, Fabrizio; Motta, Stefano; Cicconardi, Francesco; Mancia, Filippo; Bertorelle, Giorgio; D039,; Annessa, Ilda; Marino, Daniele Di",Mol. biol. evol,,67

METHODS: Fifty-one children aged 6-12 years with at least one incisor and one first permanent molar with yellow/brown MIH opacities were included. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: FV - Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat); FV + etch - Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat) after enamel etching with 37% phosphoric acid; or RI - Resin Infiltration system (Icon). Opacities were monitored for 18-months. The primary outcome was the loss of integrity due to post-eruptive enamel breakdown (PEB). Covariables included sex, age, DMFT index, opacity colour, plaque, number of MIH-affected teeth and surfaces. Fisher's Exact was used to test the association of treatments with PEB, the Kaplan-Meyer method analysed the survival rates and Cox-regression determined which covariables would predict failure (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: From a total of 235 teeth, the PEB rate for RI (6.1%) was significantly lower than FV (17.9%; OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.07, 8.48) and FV + etch (17.3%; OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.13, 8.73). DMFT index >3, brown opacities, cusp involvement, and age between 6-8 years predicted PEB (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Resin infiltration positively influenced the structural integrity maintenance of MIH-affected teeth by decreasing the risk of enamel breakdown after18 months follow-up.

Mobility Restrictions and COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak Control,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the differences in the appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest computed tomography (CT) images of outpatient and cases that developed during hospitalisation. METHOD: Chest CT images of 66 patients (median age, 76 years; range, 29-94 years) who underwent the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were included in this retrospective study. The chest CT appearance was categorised as ""typical,"" ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" or ""negative"" in accordance with the recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America for COVID-19 pneumonia and compared among the following four subgroups: PCR-positive outpatient (n = 14); PCR-positive hospitalised (n = 7); PCR-negative outpatient (n = 9); and PCR-negative hospitalised (n = 36). FINDINGS: The frequency of ""typical"" findings in the PCR-positive outpatient cases (13/14, 92.9%) was significantly higher than that of those in the PCR-positive hospitalised cases (2/7, 28.6%, P = 0.022). There was no significant difference between the frequency of the ""typical"" appearance in PCR-positive hospitalised cases and that of those in the PCR-negative hospitalised cases (1/36, 2.8%, P = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS: When COVID-19 patients acquire infections while hospitalised, their chest CT images are less likely to show typical findings than those of outpatient cases. Comprehensive and careful assessments of CT findings and consideration of the possibility of concomitant infections with other pathogens and clinical information, such as underlying diseases, background lung structure, and time course of the infection, are required for the management of such cases.","Shirota, Go; Sato, Yuko; Itoh, Daisuke; Gonoi, Wataru; Hayashi, Takana Yamakawa; Sugita, Yoshihiro; Makita, Kohzoh",Clin Imaging,,67

457615,"Distinct disease severity between children and older adults with COVID-19: Impacts of ACE2 expression, distribution, and lung progenitor cells",2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study examines the media use of children from low-income homes during school closings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Caregivers of 151 kindergarteners from low-income homes completed questionnaires as part of a larger study. Caregivers reported how much time children spent watching television/videos and using apps on the most recent weekday and weekend days. Caregivers also reported how their child's current use of media for several different purposes compared with how much the child usually uses media for that purpose. RESULTS: Weekly average media use was 46.3 hours or 6.6 hours per day. Counter to previous research, weekday media use was higher than weekend media use, suggesting that media was likely used as a replacement for time usually spent in school. Caregivers reported increased child media use for positive purposes, such as education and maintaining relationships with family and friends outside of the home, and potentially useful but less socially valued purposes, such as occupying the child's time while caregivers were completing other tasks. Having more children in the household was related to higher media use, and girls used media for maintaining remote relationships more than boys. CONCLUSION: These findings provide reason for both concern and optimism for the impacts of pandemic closures on low-income children. High levels of media use seem to be prevalent in this population. However, the diverse purposes for media use suggest that caregivers relied on media to supplement children's academic and social growth at a time when school and socializing were not safe in their typical forms.","Dore, Rebecca A; Purtell, Kelly M; Justice, Laura M",J. dev. behav. pediatr,,67

458020,Safe hospital preparedness in the era of COVID-19: The Swiss cheese model,2020,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19 identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the performanceson both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.","Wang, Zhao; Liu, Quande; Dou, Qi",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,67

The magnetostrictive interaction enables the coupling between a magnon mode (spin wave) and a mechanical mode in the ferrimagnet, and the magnon mode simultaneously couples to two microwave cavity fields via the magnetic dipole interaction. The magnon-phonon coupling is enhanced by directly driving the ferrimagnet with a strong red-detuned microwave field, and the driving photons are scattered onto two sidebands induced by the mechanical motion. We show that two cavity fields can be prepared in a stationary entangled state if they are respectively resonant with two mechanical sidebands. The present scheme illustrates a new mechanism for creating entangled states of optical fields, and enables potential applications in quantum information science and quantum tasks that require entangled microwave fields.","Yu, Mei; Shen, Heng; Li, Jie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05936v1.pdf,67

The process of requesting pathological investigations is usually handled manually through paper-based forms. This study evaluated the potential for paper-based request forms to transmit severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to laboratory staff in order to make recommendations for dealing with hospital paperwork in a post-COVID-19 world. Methods: Paper-based forms were tracked from the time of test ordering until the release of the pathology report by calculating the time taken for the forms to reach the laboratory, and the exposure of each staff group to forms received from both high and moderate COVID-19 risk areas. Results: Four hundred and thirty-two (83%) of 520 forms were received in the laboratory within 24 h. The remaining 88 (17%) forms took ≥24 h to be handled by laboratory personnel. The mean daily exposure time to the paperwork for various laboratory staff was as follows: receptionists, 2.7 min; technicians, 5.5 min; and pathologists, 54.6 min. Conclusion: More than 80% of the forms were handled by laboratory personnel within 24 h, carrying a high potential risk for viral transmission. It is recommended that paper-based request forms should be replaced by electronic requests that could be printed in the laboratory if required. Another option would be to sterilize received paperwork to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel.

465622,Transcription factor-mediated signaling pathways' contribution to the pathology of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020,"Aim: to present a mathematical model of the development of COVID-19 in Moscow along with the analysis of some scenarios of epidemic control and possible epidemic consequences. Materials and Methods. The modeling of the epidemics was based on the extended SEIR model proposed lately in the group of Prof. R. Neher and realized as a freely available software program. The authors based the choice of the parameters of modeling on published data on the epidemiological properties of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and open access data on the registered cases of COVID-19 in Moscow for 8-27 March 2020. Results. Five potential scenarios of the development of COVID-19 epidemics are studied. The scenarios are differed by the levels of the control measures: Null Scenario corresponded to the lack of protective measures, Scenario A - mild measures of the epidemic control (closing of schools and universities, recommendations for senior citizens to stay inside), Scenario B - medium level of control (closing of all public places, recommendation for the citizens to stay inside), Scenarios C and D - complete lockdown (from the beginning of May 2020 within Scenario C and from the beginning of April 2020 within Scenario D). It was shown that within the Null Scenario, the lethality from the novel coronavirus in Moscow will exceed 100 thousand people, and the number of critically ill patients on the peak of the epidemics will exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Scenarios A and B did not provide for a radical decrease in the fatality rate, and the number of critically ill patients at the peak of epidemics will still exceed the capacities of the system of healthcare. Besides, within Scenario B, the epidemics will last for more than a year. Scenarios C and D will allow for the control of epidemics and a significant decrease in the rate of lethality (by 30 and 400 times, respectively). At the same time, these two scenarios prevent the population from developing herd immunity, which would result in the population susceptibility to repeated epidemics outbreaks. Conclusion. The scenarios intended for the slow development of herd immunity in the conditions of epidemic control would not bring sufficient results: the lethality would remain unacceptably high, the capacities of the system of healthcare would be overloaded, and the time of limiting measures would be unacceptably long. Such measures as complete lockdown would stop the present epidemics. The earlier they are introduced, the more efficient will be the results. To prevent further repeated outbreaks of the epidemics, it is necessary to establish a system of available, quick, and efficient testing in combination with point isolation of the infected patients and their contacts.","Tamm, M.

Further, the correlates of fear of crime may also be different. To explore these issues, data from the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment II survey of U.S. and Canadian college students are used. Results show that Canadian college students generally perceive their safety as being higher than U.S. college students, even though they face elevated victimization risks.

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Cell Res,,67

472693,Chlamydia (lymphogranuloma venereum) peritonitis in a male patient,2021,"COVID-19 represents a new potentially life-threatening illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. In 2021, new variants of the virus with multiple key mutations have emerged, such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.617, and are threatening to render available vaccines or potential drugs ineffective. In this regard, we highlight 3CLpro, the main viral protease, as a valuable therapeutic target that possesses no mutations in the described pandemically relevant variants. 3CLpro could therefore provide trans-variant effectiveness that is supported by structural studies and possesses readily available biological evaluation experiments. With this in mind, we performed a high throughput virtual screening experiment using CmDock and the ""In-Stock"" chemical library to prepare prioritisation lists of compounds for further studies. We coupled the virtual screening experiment to a machine learning-supported classification and activity regression study to bring maximal enrichment and available structural data on known 3CLpro inhibitors to the prepared focused libraries. All virtual screening hits are classified according to 3CLpro inhibitor, viral cysteine protease or remaining chemical space based on the calculated set of 208 chemical descriptors. Last but not least, we analysed if the current set of 3CLpro inhibitors could be used in activity prediction and observed that the field of 3CLpro inhibitors is drastically under-represented compared to the chemical space of viral cysteine protease inhibitors. We postulate that this methodology of 3CLpro inhibitor library preparation and compound prioritisation far surpass the selection of compounds from available commercial ""corona focused libraries"".","Jukic, Marko; Skrlj, Blaz; Tomsic, Gasper; Plesko, Sebastian; Podlipnik, Crtomir; Bren, Urban",Molecules (Basel),,67
472803,A need for open public data standards and sharing in light of COVID-19,2020,"To date, the only effective means to respond to the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic are non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which entail policies to reduce social activity and mobility restrictions. Quantifying their effect is difficult, but it is key to reducing their social and economic consequences. Here, we introduce a meta-population model based on temporal networks, calibrated on the COVID-19 outbreak data in Italy and applied to evaluate the outcomes of these two types of NPIs. Our approach combines the advantages of granular spatial modelling of meta-population models with the ability to realistically describe social contacts via activity-driven networks. We focus on disentangling the impact of these two different types of NPIs: those aiming at reducing individuals' social activity, for instance through lockdowns, and those that enforce mobility restrictions. We provide a valuable framework to assess the effectiveness of different NPIs, varying with respect to their timing and severity. Results suggest that the effects of mobility restrictions largely depend on the possibility of implementing timely NPIs in the early phases of the outbreak, whereas activity reduction policies should be prioritized afterwards.","Parino, Francesco; Zino, Lorenzo; Porfiri, Maurizio; Rizzo, Alessandro",J R Soc Interface,,67

478206,Repurposing antimicrobial stewardship tools in the electronic medical record for the management of COVID-19 patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is a public health strategy that aims to reduce the burden of viral illness, especially important for populations known or likely to be at increased risk for inequitable outcomes due to the disease itself or disparities in care accessed and received. The role of weight status in COVID-19 susceptibility and disease burden remains unclear. Despite this, higher weight is frequently described as a definitive risk factor for both susceptibility and disease severity. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine trials should recruit a study group representative of the full weight spectrum, and undertake appropriate subgroup analysis by weight status to evaluate response and titrate dose regimes where indicated to ensure equitable outcomes for higher weight people. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to review inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trial protocols registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, the WHO official vaccine trial register, and 'The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker'. To determine the number of trials including higher weight (body mass index >30 kg/m2) individuals and the number of trials conducting efficacy subgroup analyses by weight status. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal of trial protocols will be completed independently by a minimum of two reviewers. Clinical trials will be assessed for risk of bias using the Risk of Bias-2 tool. We will conduct a descriptive analysis of extracted data. The following subsets are proposed: participation of higher weight people in COVID-19 vaccine trials by trial phase, country and vaccine platform. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this review. The results of this rapid review will be presented at appropriate conferences and published in a suitable peer reviewed journal.

478474,Children and COVID-19 in Colorado: The children's hospital Colorado experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Health experts agree that widespread use of safe and effective vaccines will rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The big question is whether these vaccines can easily be accepted by their end-users. Our study aimed at determining sociodemographic factors associated with acceptance of vaccines and clinical trials of COVID-19 in western Uganda. METHOD: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception were assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval in R software version 3.6.3. RESULTS: There were 1067 participants in the study. The majority were males (73.2%) and age group 31-40 years (32.6%). The acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination was (53.6%; 572/1067) with those aged 18-20 years, males, elites at tertiary level of education (degree or diploma), students, Muslims, married, non-salary earners and rural dwellers having better odds and likeliness to accept vaccination. Only 44.6% (476/1067) showed interest in clinical trials among which; males, primary school leavers, students, Christians, un-married, respondents who didn't earn any salary and rural dwellers had better odds and likelihood to participate in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: There was a low level of vaccine acceptance and clinical trial interest in western Uganda. Minority groups in the study i.e., Muslims, students, primary school leavers, un-married rural dwellers among others showed more interest in vaccination and clinical trials. We anticipated fears in the larger part of this community that health experts need to address through reassurance of the community that vaccines are tested and that they are safe and important if we are to rapidly contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Echoru, Isaac; Ajambo, Patricia Decanar; Keirania, Emmanuel; Bukenya, Edmund E M",BMC Public Health,,67

Guided by the stress and coping paradigm, the current study aimed at examining the interactive effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping on mental health problems. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the current study was 13.31% and 6.61%, respectively. Results from path analyses revealed that the main effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping were significant on both depression and anxiety. The interaction of coping and COVID-19-related stressors had significant effects on depression and anxiety. Simple slope tests revealed that more coping behaviors buffered against the negative effect of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health problems. Coping acted as a protective factor that alleviated the harm of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health. Intervention targeting coping management might benefit the mental health of HIV healthcare providers.","Mi, Tianyue; Yang, Xueying; Sun, Shufang; Li, Xiaoming; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Zhou, Yuejiao; Shen, Zhiyong",AIDS behav,,67

480610,Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect,2020,"Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an established cardiac side effect of a wide range of medications and represents a significant concern for drug safety. The rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ currents, mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) and KCNQ1 + KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies; however, there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here, we studied the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that although chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG), with an IC50 of 3.0 µM, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 µM. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs were added at 10 µM to the cell culture medium for 24 hours, remdesivir increased IhERG by 2-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates that, among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels, whereas the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1 + KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, these data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","Szendrey, Mark; Guo, Jun; Li, Wentao; Yang, Tonghua; Zhang, Shetuan",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,67

The impact of liver injury on adverse clinical outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remains unclear. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from a territory-wide database in Hong Kong. COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other HCoV patients were identified by diagnosis codes and/or virological results. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was defined as ALT/AST &#8805;2 × upper limit of normal (ie, 80 U/L). The primary end point was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1040 COVID-19 patients (mean age 38 years, 54% men), 1670 SARS patients (mean age 44 years, 44% men) and 675 other HCoV patients (mean age 20 years, 57% men). ALT/AST elevation occurred in 50.3% SARS patients, 22.5% COVID-19 patients and 36.0% other HCoV patients. For COVID-19 patients, 53 (5.1%) were admitted to ICU, 22 (2.1%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 4 (0.4%) died. ALT/AST elevation was independently associated with primary end point (adjusted OR (aOR) 7.92, 95% CI 4.14 to 15.14, p<0.001) after adjusted for albumin, diabetes and hypertension. Use of lopinavir-ritonavir ±ribavirin + interferon beta (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.13, p=0.006) and corticosteroids (aOR 3.92, 95% CI 2.14 to 7.16, p<0.001) was independently associated with ALT/AST elevation. CONCLUSION: ALT/AST elevation was common and independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Use of lopinavir-ritonavir, with or without ribavirin, interferon beta and/or corticosteroids was independently associated with ALT/AST elevation.","Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Ho, Tracy Hang-Yee; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Tse, Yee-Kit; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung",Gut,,67

485889,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Ambulatory Antibiotic Use in an Academic Health System,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies proposed the whole-blood based IFN-Î³-release assay to study the antigen-specific SARS-CoV-2 response. Since the early prediction of disease progression could help to assess the optimal treatment strategies, an integrated knowledge of T-cell and antibody response lays the foundation to develop biomarkers monitoring the COVID-19. Whole-blood-platform tests based on the immune response detection to SARS-CoV2 peptides is a new approach to discriminate COVID-19-patients from uninfected-individuals and to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, monitoring the immune response in vaccine trial and supporting the serological diagnostics results. Here, we aimed to identify in the whole-blood-platform the best immunogenic viral antigen and the best immune biomarker to identify COVID-19-patients. METHODS: Whole-blood was overnight-stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools of nucleoprotein-(NP) Membrane-, ORF3a- and Spike-protein. We evaluated: IL-1ß, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL- 15, IL-17A, eotaxin, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, MIP-1ß, PDGF, RANTES, TNF-&#945;, VEGF. By a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis we identified the most important soluble factors discriminating COVID-19- from NO-COVID-19-individuals. RESULTS: We identified a COVID-19 signature based on six immune factors: IFN-Î³, IP-10 and IL-2 induced by Spike; RANTES and IP-10 induced by NP and IL-2 induced by ORF3a. We demonstrated that the test based on IP-10 induced by Spike had the highest AUC (0.85, p < 0.0001) and that the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19-patients did not affect IP-10 production. Finally, we validated the use of IP-10 as biomarker for SARS-CoV2 infection in two additional COVID-19-patients cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We set-up a whole-blood assay identifying the best antigen to induce a T-cell response and the best biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluating patients with acute COVID-19 and recovered patients. We focused on IP-10, already described as a potential biomarker for other infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HCV. An additional application of this test is the evaluation of immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials: the IP-10 detection may define the immunogenicity of a Spike-based vaccine, whereas the immune response to the virus may be evaluated detecting other soluble factors induced by other viral-antigens.","Petruccioli, Elisa; Najafi Fard, Saeid; Navarra, Assunta; Petrone, Linda; Vanini, Valentina; Cuzzi, Gilda; Gualano, Gina; Pierelli, Luca; Bertoletti, Antonio; Nicastri, Emanuele; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Goletti, Delia",J Transl Med,,67

Because particulate pollutants scatter, diffuse, and absorb incoming solar radiation, a net negative radiative forcing, decreased air pollution can yield surface warming. As such, this study (1) documents the evolution of China's January-February 2020 air temperature and concurrent particulate changes; (2) determines the temperature response related to reduced particulates during the COVID-19 quarantine (C19Q); and (3) discusses the conceptual implications for temperature-dependent disease transmission. C19Q particulate evolution is monitored using satellite analyses, and concurrent temperature anomalies are diagnosed using surface stations and Aqua AIRS imagery. Meanwhile, two WRF-Chem simulations are forced by normal emissions and the satellite-based urban aerosol changes, respectively. Urban aerosols decreased from 27.1% of pre-C19Q aerosols to only 17.5% during C19Q. WRF-Chem resolved ~0.2 °C warming across east-central China, that represented a minor, though statistically significant contribution to C19Q temperature anomalies. The largest area of warming is concentrated south of Chengdu and Wuhan where temperatures increased between +0.2-0.3 °C. The results of this study are important for understanding the anthropogenic forcing on regional meteorology. Epidemiologically, the marginal, yet persistent, warming during C19Q may retard temperature-dependent disease transmission, possibly including SARS-CoV-2.","Miller, P W; Reesman, C; Grossman, M K; Nelson, S A; Liu, V; Wang, P",Sci Total Environ,,67

486625,Why contact tracing efforts have failed to curb COVID-19 transmission in much of the U.S,2020,"Although the ""panic"" word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e g , respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder - i e , fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities - are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not In people with the comorbidity (i e , panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19)","Javelot, H.; Weiner, L.",Encephale,,67

However, response to vaccines may be less predictable in immunocompromised people. While outcomes for individuals with autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases have dramatically improved with treatment using immunomodulating and biologic agents, infections have caused significant morbidity in these people today often more than due to their underlying diseases. Immune-based biologic therapies contribute to these infectious complications. This review addresses anti-viral vaccines, their effectiveness and safety in patients treated with approved biologic agents and immune targeted therapy with a focus on vaccines against influenza, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus and varicella zoster virus. Preliminary information regarding SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral vaccines is addressed. Additionally, we present recommendations regarding the safe use of vaccines in immunocompromised individuals with the goal to enhance awareness of the safety and efficacy of these anti-viral vaccines in these high-risk populations.","Ostrov, Barbara E; Amsterdam, Daniel",Immunol Invest,,67

490711,The collective wisdom in the COVID-19 research: Comparison and synthesis of epidemiological parameter estimates in preprints and peer-reviewed articles,2020,"BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, but these associations are still not clear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth and maternal and perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based cohort study in England. The inclusion criteria were women with a recorded singleton birth between May 29, 2020, and January 31, 2021, in a national database of hospital admissions. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in the birth episode and those without. Study outcomes were fetal death at or beyond 24 weeks' gestation (stillbirth), preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation), small for gestational age infant (small for gestational age; birthweight at the <tenth centile), preeclampsia or eclampsia, induction of labor, mode of birth, specialist neonatal care, composite neonatal adverse outcome indicator, maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay after birth (3 days or more), and 28-day neonatal and 42-day maternal hospital readmission. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection status and outcomes were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, preexisting diabetes mellitus, preexisting hypertension, and socioeconomic deprivation measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019. Models were fitted with robust standard errors to account for hospital-level clustering. The analysis of the neonatal outcomes was repeated for those born at term (&#8805;37 weeks' gestation) because preterm birth has been reported to be more common in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The analysis included 342,080 women, of whom 3527 had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was more common in women who were younger, of non-White ethnicity, primiparous, or residing in the most deprived areas or had comorbidities. Fetal death (adjusted odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-3.11; P<.001) and preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.96-2.42; P<.001) occurred more frequently in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. The risk of preeclampsia or eclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.85; P<.001), birth by emergency cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-1.76; P<.001), and prolonged admission after birth (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-1.72; P<.001) were significantly higher for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. There were no significant differences (P>.05) in the rate of other maternal outcomes. The risk of neonatal adverse outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.66; P<.001), need for specialist neonatal care (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.51; P=.03), and prolonged neonatal admission after birth (adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.75; P<.001) were all significantly higher for infants with mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the analysis was restricted to pregnancies delivered at term (&#8805;37 weeks), there were no significant differences in neonatal adverse outcome (P=.78), need for specialist neonatal care after birth (P=.22), or neonatal readmission within 4 weeks of birth (P=.05). Neonates born at term to mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have prolonged admission after birth (21.1% compared with 14.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.75; P<.001). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth is associated with higher rates of fetal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia, and emergency cesarean delivery. There were no additional adverse neonatal outcomes, other than those related to preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be counseled regarding risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be considered a priority for vaccination.","Gurol-Urganci, Ipek; Jardine, Jennifer E; Carroll, Fran; Draycott, Tim; Dunn, George; Fremeaux, Alissa; Harris, Tina; Hawdon, Jane; Morris, Edward; Muller, Patrick; Waite, Lara; Webster, Kirstin; van der Meulen, Jan; Khalil, Asma",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,67
490897,Incidence of Health Care-Associated COVID-19 During Universal Testing of Medical and Surgical Admissions in a Large US Health System,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the prehospital setting, endotracheal intubation (ETI) may be required to secure the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient airway. It has been suggested that the use of a protective barrier can reduce possible aerosol delivery from patients to clinicians during ETI. We sought to assess the performance of ETI by paramedics wearing personal protective equipment with and without the use of a box barrier. METHODS: A randomized, crossover simulation study was performed in a simulation laboratory. Study participants were 18 paramedics actively working in the clinical environment. Participants' performance of ETI via direct laryngoscopy (DL) with and without the use of a box barrier was assessed. The sequence of intubation was randomized to either BoxDL-first or DL-first. The primary outcome was the success rate of ETI on first-attempt. The secondary and tertiary outcomes were ETI success rates on three attempts and total intubation time, respectively. RESULTS: There were no differences between the DL group and the BoxDL group in one-attempt success rates (14/18 vs 12/18; P = 0.754), and in overall success rates (16/18 vs 14/18; P = 0.682). The mean (standard deviation) of the total intubation times for the DL group and the BoxDL group were 27.3 (19.7) seconds and 36.8 (26.2) seconds, respectively (P < 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest that paramedics wearing personal protective equipment can successfully perform ETI using a barrier box, but the intubation time may be prolonged. The applicability of these findings to the care of COVID-19 patients remain to be investigated.","Feldman, Oren; Samuel, Nir; Kvatinsky, Noa; Idelman, Ravit; Diamand, Raz; Shavit, Itai",PLoS One,,67

In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible, until the patient felt too tired to maintain that position. Light sedation was administered with dexmedetomidine. The following information were collected: number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were fit to estimate changes from baseline with a random effect for patient. RESULTS: Seven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID 19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. Dexmedetomidine was used in all PP sessions. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) significantly increased during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 110 [19; 202]) and after PP, albeit not significantly (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 38 [-9.2; 85]) compared with previous supine position. Similarly, tissue oxygenation underwent a small improvement during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 2.6% [0.69; 4.6]) without significant changes after PP. Two patients required intubation. All patients were discharged from the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PP improved oxygenation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS. PP was relatively well tolerated in our patients and may be a simple strategy to improve oxygenation trying to reduce patients in mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU, especially in COVID-19 pandemic.","Taboada, Manuel; González, Mariana; Álvarez, Antía; González, Irene; García, Javier; Eiras, María; Diaz Vieito, María; Naveira, Alberto; Otero, Pablo; Campaña, Olga; Muniategui, Ignacio; Tubio, Ana; Costa, Jose; Selas, Salomé; Cariñena, Agustín; Martínez, Adrián; Veiras, Sonia; Aneiros, Francisco; Caruezo, Valentín; Baluja, Aurora; Alvarez, Julian",,,67

Considering this outbreak, by far, it is the most decisive task to detect early and isolate the patients quickly to contain the spread of this virus. In such cases, artificial intelligence and machine learning or deep learning methods can come to aid. For that purpose, we have conducted a qualitative investigation to inspect 12 off-the-shelf Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures in classifying COVID-19 from CT scan images. Furthermore, a segmentation algorithm for biomedical images - U-Net, is analyzed to evaluate the performance of the CNN models. A publicly available dataset (SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan) containing a total of 2481 CT scan images is employed for the performance evaluation. In terms of feature extraction by excluding the segmentation technique, a performance of 88.60% as the F1 Score and 89.31% as accuracy is achieved by training DenseNet169 architecture. Adopting the U-Net segmentation method, we accomplished the most optimal accuracy and F1 Scores as 89.92% and 89.67% respectively on DenseNet201 model. Furthermore, evaluating the performances, we can affirm that a combination of a Transfer Learning architecture with a segmentation technique (U-Net) enhances the performance of the classification model. © 2020 IEEE.","Seum, A.; Raj, A.

However, the needs and requirements of home-based isolation are extremely unique for each patient, depending on their medical condition and comorbidities, family responsibilities, and environmental constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to develop personalized patient care plans to ensure that the needs of each patient are appropriately met.

502414,The clinical course of COVID-19 in the outpatient setting: a prospective cohort study,2021,"The aim of this study was to analyze athletes' quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 249 athletes between 15 and 35 of age, M = 21.22, SD = 5.12. The sample was composed of eight Olympic Games medalists, three European medalists, 67 international medalists, and 63 national medalists. The instruments used were: (1) COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, (2) Athlete Quality of Life Scale, (3) Impact of Pandemic on Athletes Questionnaire, and (4) International Personality Item Pool (IPIP Anxiety, Depression, and Vulnerability Scales). The results indicate significant differences in COVID-19 anxiety depending on the sport practiced, F (9239) = 3.81, p &lt; 0.01, showing that there were significant differences between sports. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic mediates the relationship between trait anxiety and the athletes' quality of life. The percentage of mediation was 33.9%, and the indirect effect was -0.11, CI 95% (-0.18, -0.03), Z = -2.82, p &lt; 0.01. Trait anxiety has an increasing effect on the intensity of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 0.23, CI 95% (.10, 0.35), Z = 3.56, p &lt; 0.01, and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has a decreasing effect on quality of life, -0.47, CI 95% (-0.67, -0.27), Z = -4.62, p &lt; 0.01. Gender and age did not moderate the relationship between the negative impact of COVID-19 and athletes' quality of life. The results of the study highlighted the impact that social isolation and quarantine have on athletes' affective well-being.","Cosma, G. A.; Chiracu, A.; Stepan, A. R.; Cosma, M. A.; Nanu, M.

Nursing students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in documented trauma, complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and secondary stress syndrome. Students entering health care in a new landscape of ongoing trauma and chronic stress exposure require a shift in the nurse educators' role and position. Extensive outcome-based synthesis of trauma-informed education in other disciplines served as basis to create a pedagogical context using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) framework for trauma-informed schools. Utilizing Watson's strategies for human caring theory in nursing education, a trauma-informed pedagogy is proposed for nurse educators. This framework for nurse educators and leaders will assist in navigating how to approach trauma-informed education in the context of higher education in nursing. It is time for a paradigm shift in nursing education towards a more collaborative, relational model with students, based on trauma-informed care; where trauma awareness and the impact on one's being serves purpose for the nursing student.","Goddard, Anna; Jones, Rebecca Witten; Esposito, Dorothea; Janicek, Erin",Nurse Educ Today,,67

504787,How useful is serology for COVID-19?,2021,"Reproductive strategies vary according to season length, individual reproductive traits, and factors associated with the social context such as density and sex ratio of the individuals. The social context predicts the intensity of sexual selection due to its effect on mate choice and intra-sexual competition. Moreover, it exacerbates the costs derived from sexual conflict and allows for the existence of alternative reproductive tactics to counteract such costs. However, these mechanisms are still underexplored in many animal taxa. Majoidea ""spider crabs"" show a diversity of life history, and behavioral and morphological adaptations for reproduction, which have evolved as an outcome of competition to maximize reproductive success. We aimed to analyze in this study, male reproductive strategies through mating behavior under different social contexts, density of individuals, and males size differences in two species of ""spider crabs"", Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa. The experiments were as follows: one female and one male per aquarium (Experiment 1); a female and three males of similar sizes per aquarium (Experiment 2); and a female and three males of distinct sizes per aquarium (Experiment 3). The experiments showed that mating behavior and duration of mate guarding differ between species and among different social contexts. The presence of males with similar or different sizes showed a relevant different behavior, the female copulated with more than one male when males were similar in size (E2), and copulated only with the largest male when males were different in size (E3). In mate guarding, the shape and the use of the chelipeds had an important role: the male of Leurocyclus tuberculosus grasped the female with the chelipeds and did not fight with other males, but the male of Libinia spinosa surrounded the female with the chelipeds and fought with other males. The longest duration of mate guarding was during precopulatory guarding. Precopulatory guarding was present in all the experiments and its duration did not present significant differences among the experiments. However, in both species, the experiments differ in the duration of postcopulatory guarding until spawning. Gonopod morphology revealed important differences between species and are probably associated with sperm competition. The experiments under distinct social contexts linked to the use and shape of the chelipeds and the morphology of the gonopods, could allow to understand the functional significance of the different reproductive strategies.","González Pisani, Ximena; López Greco, Laura S",Zoology (Jena),,67

507280,Asymptomatic COVID-19 in hospital visitors: The underestimated potential of viral shedding,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China and later spread rapidly to other parts of the world, including Africa. Africa was projected to be devastated by COVID-19. There is currently limited data regarding regional predictors of mortality among patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. METHODS: A total of 1028 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Africa with definite survival outcomes were identified retrospectively from an open-access individual-level worldwide COVID-19 database. The live version of the dataset is available at https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019 . Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the risk factors that independently predict mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. RESULTS: Of the 1028 cases included in study, 432 (42.0%) were females with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 50 (24) years. Older age (adjusted odds ratio {aOR} 1.06; [95% confidence intervals {95% CI}, 1.04-1.08]), presence of chronic disease (aOR 9.63; [95% CI, 3.84-24.15]), travel history (aOR 2.44; [95% CI, 1.26-4.72]), as well as locations of Central Africa (aOR 0.14; [95% CI, 0.03-0.72]) and West Africa (aOR 0.12; [95% CI, 0.04-0.32]) were identified as the independent risk factors significantly associated with increased mortality among the patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving gradually in Africa. Among patients with COVID-19 in Africa, older age, presence of chronic disease, travel history, and the locations of Central Africa and West Africa were associated with increased mortality. A regional response should prioritize strategies that will protect these populations. Also, conducting a further in-depth study could provide more insights into additional factors predictive of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Mohammed, Mustapha; Muhammad, Surajuddeen; Mohammed, Fatima Zaji; Mustapha, Sagir; Sha039,; aban, Abubakar; Sani, Najib Yahaya; Ahmad, Mubarak Hussaini; Bala, Auwal Adam; Ungogo, Marzuq Abubakar; Alotaibi, Nawaf M; Zainal, Hadzliana",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,67

Different models have been simulated with different vent position and the results have been observed. With the unruly rise in the spread of the COVID-19, it is paramount to restrain the virus propagation within the hospital premises. The purpose of the research is to control the virus dissemination caused by sneezing, by altering the position of the ventilation i.e. air inlet and outlet, by using flow across the room to direct it towards the outlet with maintaining a negative pressure. The negative strain helps in confining the air-borne transmission of the deadly virus from spreading across the room and not letting them permeate outside the isolated region. An isolation room model has been studied using computational fluid dynamics, by setting up a discrete phase model by using injection spray modelling to observe the permeation of the virus droplets. The behaviour of these aerosol droplets are studied using simple-semi implicit method for the equation associated with pressure by specifying the droplet size. By altering inlet and outlet locations we are able to minimise the spread of these harmful droplets by using the flow from the air inlet to go against the diffusing droplets. These paper aides well for a sudden isolation room setup anywhere with peruse dimensions of the inlet and outlet height at most optimum position.","Shekar, N. V. Chandra Abhinay B.; Pavan, C.

We assessed immunogenicity to a first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2-vaccination dose in dialysis patients. METHODS: In a multicenter observational pilot study, 2 weeks after a first vaccination (BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech [Comirnaty] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/Oxford-Astra-Zeneca [Vaxzevria]), hemodialysis patients (N = 23), peritoneal dialysis patients (N = 4) and healthy staff (N = 14) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG/IgM, Nucleocapsid-protein-IgG-antibodies and plasma ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity. Hemodialysis patients who had had prior COVID-19 infection (N = 18) served as controls. Both response to first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and IgG spike-positivity following prior COVID-19 infection were defined as SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels &#8805; 50 AU/mL. RESULTS: Vaccination responder rates were 17.4% (4/23) in hemodialysis patients, 100% (4/4) in peritoneal dialysis patients and 57.1% (8/14) in staff (HD vs. PD: p = 0.004, HD vs. staff: p = 0.027). Among hemodialysis patients, type of vaccine (Comirnaty N = 11, Vaxzevria N = 12, 2 responders each) did not appear to influence antibody levels (IgG spike: Comirnaty median 0.0 [1.-3. quartile 0.0-3.8] versus Vaxzevria 4.3 [1.6-20.1] AU/mL, p = 0.079). Of responders to the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialysis patients (N = 4/23), median IgG spike levels and ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity were lower than that of IgG spike-positive hemodialysis patients with prior COVID-19 infection (13/18, 72.2%): IgG spike: median 222.0, 1.-3. quartile 104.1-721.9 versus median 3794.6, 1.-3. quartile 793.4-9357.9 AU/mL, p = 0.015; ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity: median 11.5%, 1.-3. quartile 5.0-27.3 versus median 74.8%, 1.-3. quartile 44.9-98.1, p = 0.002.

Participation was possible in the period from June to August 2020. Results: In all, 76 specialists with additional qualification in allergology took part in the survey. Of these, 71 completed the full questionnaire. Before the start of the pandemic-related contact restrictions, 46.5% (33/71) stated that they had used telemedicine in their clinical practice. This number increased to 73.2% (52/71) after 31 January 2020. The largest increase (4.3% vs. 15.6%) was seen in the area of video consultations. Furthermore, 43/76 participants can imagine integrating telemedicine services into their daily clinical routine in the future. Conclusion: The use of telemedical services, especially video consultations, increased significantly during the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic in Germany. The majority of respondents perceive the implementation as positive and can imagine continuing to use telemedical methods after the end of the pandemic.","Dramburg, Stephanie; Matricardi, Paolo Maria; Casper, Ingrid; Klimek, Ludger",Allergo J Int,,67

We identify four key themes developing over time. In relation to evolving COVID-19 prevention policies, (a) the lockdown interrupted life and experiences of temporality. (b) Following the lockdown, risk management changed from fear to insecurities and (c) simultaneously, emotion management transitioned from solidarity to fragmentation. (d) Increasingly, pragmatic considerations allowed parents to tackle uncertainties and created room to normalize everyday life. We studied ""change"" by using a novel conceptual model for temporality and found distinct temporalities in parents' accounts. In sum, we interpret this as a shift from danger to uncertainty, induced by policy shifts and pragmatically translating those to the lifeworld.","Bröer, Christian; Veltkamp, Gerlieke; Bouw, Carolien; Vlaar, Noa; Borst, Femke; de Sauvage Nolting, Rein",Qual Health Res,,67

It is currently categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Studies have focused on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal effects of this infection, but liver test abnormalities have also been documented. This alteration may be a consequence of viral hepatitis, pharmacological toxicity, inflammation, or shock. It is also considered a marker of prognosis and severity of the disease.

Recent publications have suggested that 10% of Clinical Commissioning Groups in the United Kingdom no longer fund septorhinoplasty surgery irrespective of the indications, including congenital malformations or post-trauma, and despite the strong evidence available in the literature in treating a range of health conditions. Thus, inequity exists across the country. At present functional septorhinoplasty surgery is frequently but incorrectly grouped together with aesthetic rhinoplasty, both of which are deemed to be cosmetic interventions. Moreover, as we exit the peak of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, procedures deemed to be of lower clinical priority will potentially be at risk throughout Europe. The purpose of this review is twofold; the first is to put forward the evidence to commissioners in favor of functional septorhinoplasty surgery on patient well-being and mental health; the second is to demonstrate why functional septorhinoplasty surgery is a distinct procedure from aesthetic rhinoplasty and why it ought not to be classified as a procedure of limited clinical value.","Unadkat, Samit N; Pendolino, Alfonso Luca; Auer, Deborah; Khwaja, Sadie; Randhawa, Premjit S; Andrews, Peter J; Saleh, Hesham A",Facial plast. surg,,67

Objective: To identify excess risk and risk factors associated with hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study included 88â¯747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between Feburary 28 and May 14, 2020, and followed up through June 22, 2020, in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national health care system, including 10â¯131 patients (11.4%) who tested positive. Exposures: Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, symptoms, and laboratory test results. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The 10â¯131 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly male (9221 [91.0%]), with diverse race/ethnicity (5022 [49.6%] White, 4215 [41.6%] Black, and 944 [9.3%] Hispanic) and a mean (SD) age of 63.6 (16.2) years. Compared with patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, those who tested positive had higher rates of 30-day hospitalization (30.4% vs 29.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.13), mechanical ventilation (6.7% vs 1.7%; aHR, 4.15; 95% CI, 3.74-4.61), and death (10.8% vs 2.4%; aHR, 4.44; 95% CI, 4.07-4.83). Among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, characteristics significantly associated with mortality included older age (eg, &#8805;80 years vs <50 years: aHR, 60.80; 95% CI, 29.67-124.61), high regional COVID-19 disease burden (eg, &#8805;700 vs <130 deaths per 1 million residents: aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (eg, &#8805;5 vs 0: aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.54-2.42), fever (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.32-1.72), dyspnea (aHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07), and abnormalities in the certain blood tests, which exhibited dose-response associations with mortality, including aspartate aminotransferase (>89 U/L vs &#8804;25 U/L: aHR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.35-2.57), creatinine (>3.80 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL: aHR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.62-5.48), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>12.70 vs &#8804;2.71: aHR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.12-3.91). With the exception of geographic region, the same covariates were independently associated with mechanical ventilation along with Black race (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.85), male sex (aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.30-3.32), diabetes (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67), and hypertension (aHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64). Notable characteristics that were not significantly associated with mortality in adjusted analyses included obesity (body mass index &#8805;35 vs 18.5-24.9: aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.21), Black race (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.21), Hispanic ethnicity (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79-1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88-1.19), hypertension (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.12), and smoking (eg, current vs never: aHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.13). Most deaths in this cohort occurred in patients with age of 50 years or older (63.4%), male sex (12.3%), and Charlson Comorbidity Index score of at least 1 (11.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this national cohort of VA patients, most SARS-CoV-2 deaths were associated with older age, male sex, and comorbidity burden. Many factors previously reported to be associated with mortality in smaller studies were not confirmed, such as obesity, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and smoking.","Ioannou, George N; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Berry, Kristin; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Shah, Javeed A; Crothers, Kristina; Eastment, McKenna C; Dominitz, Jason A; Fan, Vincent S",JAMA Netw Open,,67

OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess the differences in utilization of provider-to-provider teledermatology services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) to assess dermatology resident and faculty experiences with the integration of teledermatology into dermatology residency training at the University of Ottawa. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing provider-to-provider teledermatology consults submitted to dermatologists from April 2019 to October 2019 pre-pandemic with the same period during the pandemic in 2020. Two different questionnaires were also disseminated to the dermatology residents and faculty at our institution inquiring about their perspectives on teledermatology, education, and practice. RESULTS: The number of dermatologists completing consults, the number of providers submitting a case to Dermatology, and the number of consults initiated all increased during the pandemic period. Ninety-one percent of residents agreed that eConsults and teledermatology enhanced their residency education, enabled continuation of training during the pandemic, and that eConsult-based training should be incorporated into the curriculum. Ninety-six percent of staff incorporated a virtual dermatology practice model, and one-third used teledermatology with residents during the pandemic. Most staff felt there was value in providing virtual visits in some capacity during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the use of teledermatology services continues to increase accessibility during the pandemic. Teledermatology enhances the education and training of residents and will be incorporated into dermatology residency programs.","Mahmood, Farhan; Cyr, Janelle; Keely, Erin; Afkham, Amir; Gugiani, Sheena; Walker, Jim; DesGroseilliers, Jean-Pierre; Kirshen, Carly",J Cutan Med Surg,https://doi.org/10.1177/12034754211045393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551623/,67
591163,Effect of steroids on Covid-19 mortality risk: a Bayesian interpretation,2020-11-29,"Background and Objectives: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease with a complex pathophysiology involving immune-mediated reactions that lead to skin lesions that are typically localized and recurrent. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, attempting to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on diseases caused by complex immune mechanisms has become important. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the course of AD, including immunosuppressive therapy, in patients with a severe form of the disease. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 21 adults aged 18 to 52 years with AD diagnosed with COVID-19, including patients requiring hospitalization, was performed. Results: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, temporary exacerbation of skin lesions and/or skin pruritus was observed in nine (43%) patients but without the need for systemic treatment intervention. Patients with severe AD who received immunosuppressive therapy most often manifested mild exacerbation of skin symptoms. The skin condition improved in three patients. There was no significant effect of disease severity on the risk of severe COVID-19 (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32–0.65). Conclusions: The course of atopic dermatitis during SARS-CoV-2 infection may be different from the severity of its symptoms due to the lack of a significant influence. The immunosuppressive treatment used in patients with severe AD did not significantly affect the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Miodońska, Martyna; Bogacz, Agnieszka; Mróz, Magdalena; Mućka, Szymon; Bożek, Andrzej",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067403/,67

In the past few years, several early warning signals (EWS) were introduced, to alert to impending critical transitions and extend the set of indicators for risk assessment. While they were originally thought to be generic, recent works demonstrated their sensitivity to some dynamical characteristics such as system noise and rates of approach to critical parameter values. Moreover, testing on empirical data is so far limited. Hence, validating their performance remains a challenge. In this study, we analyse the performance of common EWS such as increasing variance and autocorrelation in detecting the emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in various countries, based on prevalence data. We show that EWS are successful in detecting disease emergence provided that some basic assumptions are satisfied: a slow forcing through the transitions and not fat-tailed noise. We also show cases where EWS fail, thus providing a verification analysis of their potential and limitations. Overall, this suggests that EWS can be useful for active monitoring of epidemic dynamics, but that their performance is sensitive to surveillance procedures. Our results thus represent a further step towards the application of EWS indicators for informing public health policies.","Proverbio, D.; Kemp, F.; Magni, S.; Goncalves, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.30.21254631v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.30.21254631,67

Overall, our research has shown that authentic, high quality VLEs are ones that have as their primary focus the communication between students and their teachers and between students and their peers. This communication is best generated through synchronous connections where there exists the ability to convey the student’s immediate needs in real-time. Our research results and discussion will outline how a team approach that brings together teachers, students, administration, counsellors, mental health support staff, instructional designers, and ICT specialists is necessary to create a genuinely enriching VLE where both learning and social-emotional needs can be met.

Dendritic cells (DCs), through uptake and presentation of antigens to T cells, initiate distinct immune responses to different infections. In this study, an attenuated TGEV (STC3) and a virulent TGEV (SHXB) were used to determine whether porcine DCs play an important role in pathogenetic differences between these two TGEVs. Our results showed that immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) were susceptible to infection with SHXB and STC3. However, only SHXB inhibited Mo-DCs to activate T-cell proliferation by down-regulating the expression of cell–surface markers and the secretion of cytokines in vitro. In addition, after 48 h of SHXB infection, there was the impairment in the ability of porcine intestinal DCs to sample the antigen, to migrate from the villi to the lamina propria and to activate T-cell proliferation in vivo. In contrast, these abilities of intestinal DCs were enhanced in STC3-infected piglets. In conclusion, our results show that SHXB significantly impaired the functions of Mo-DCs and intestinal DCs in vitro and in vivo, while STC3 had the opposite effect. These differences may underlie the pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV in piglets, and could help us to develop a better strategy to prevent virulent TGEV infection.","Zhao, Shanshan; Gao, Qi; Qin, Tao; Yin, Yinyan; Lin, Jian; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514001679; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.03.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514001679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742951/,67

The formal specification of the zombie-city model and rigorous expressions of scenarios enable rigorous description and formal reasoning of an artificial society. A feedback loop of this approach supports the iterative adjustment of emergency management policies and the creation of more effective policies. This approach is verified by applying it to a case of an infectious disease transmission with quantitative evaluations, qualitative reasoning and analysis, and iterative adjustments.

This study aimed to investigate whether the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) might increase the risk of severe infection and fatality in COVID-19 patients. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, MedRxiv and COVID-19 academic research communication platforms for studies reporting severe infection rates and case-fatality rates in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI up to June 20, 2020. The main outcomes were the comparisons of the severe infection rates and fatality rates in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI and the estimation of the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for severe infection and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed with R statistical software. A total of 40 studies involving 25,278 patients with COVID-19 were included in our meta-analysis. The incidence of AKI was 10% (95% CI 8%–13%) in COVID-19 patients. The patients had higher severe infection and fatality rates (55.6% vs. 17.7% and 63.1% vs. 12.9%, respectively, all P < 0.01) with COVID-19. AKI was a predictor of fatality (OR = 14.63, 95% CI: 9.94 – 21.51, P < 0.00001) and severe infection (OR = 8.11, 95% CI: 5.01-13.13, P < 0.00001) in patients with COVID-19. Higher levels of serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were associated with a significant increase in fatality [Scr: mean difference (MD): 20.19 μmol/L, 95% CI: 14.96–25.42, P < 0.001; BUN: MD: 4.07 mmol/L, 95% CI: 3.33–4.81, P < 0.001] and severe infection (Scr: MD: 7.78 μmol/L, 95% CI: 4.43–11.14, P < 0.00001, BUN: MD: 2.12 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.74–2.50, P < 0.00001) in COVID-19 patients.

Until 1992 when the Institute of Medicine issued a report that defined emerging infectious diseases, medicine had been complacent about such infectious diseases despite the alarm bells of infections with human immunodeficiency virus. Molecular tools have proven useful in discovering and characterizing emerging viruses and bacteria such as Sin Nombre virus (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome), hepatitis C virus, Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis). The feasibility of applying molecular diagnostics to dangerous, fastidious, and uncultivated agents for which conventional tests do not yield timely diagnoses has achieved proof of concept for many agents, but widespread use of cost-effective, validated commercial assays has yet to occur. This review presents representative emerging viral respiratory infections, hemorrhagic fevers, and hepatitides, as well as bacterial and parasitic zoonotic, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary infections. Agent characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods are tabulated for another 22 emerging viruses and five emerging bacteria.

The sample size was calculated assuming the prevalence of COVID-19 to be 1% with the absolute precision of 0.5% and 5% level of significance, and finite correction for population size of 500, and the calculated sample size was 377. Inclusion criteria were all personnel reporting to the institute from different states and districts. Exclusion criteria-Any personnel reported for a short visit of lesser than 14 days. Demographic details and details of any likely exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case were noted. A blood sample was collected, and serological tests were done using ErbaLisa COVID-19 IgG kit by Calbiotech, as per the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: Overall seropositivity of IgG COVID-19 antibodies was 7.5% (31/413) (95% CI: 5.3–10.4%). Study population (n = 413) comprised of an adult population in the age range of 21 years–53 years, and the mean age was 31.4 years (SD = 6.2 years). CONCLUSION: As the personnel joining the institute have come from various parts of the country the study provides an estimation of antibodies against COVID-19.","Sen, Sourav; Lall, Mahima; Faujdar, Dharamjeet Singh; Shergill, S.P.S.; Patrikar, Seema; Kaushik, S.K.; Gupta, R.M.; Naithani, Nardeep",Med J Armed Forces India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334906/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721000575; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721000575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.02.008,67
596072,Clustering cases of Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia in COVID-19 screening ward staff,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND: Reducing of COVID-19 transmission relies on controlling droplet and aerosol spread. Fluorescein staining reveals microscopic droplets. We used this technique to compare the droplet spread in a standard theatre (ST) and a laminar air flow theatre (LAF). METHODS: We used a ‘cough-generator’ fixed to a theatre trolley at 45-degrees. Fluorescein stained ‘secretions’ were projected onto a series of calibrated targets. These were photographed under UV light and a ‘source detection’ software measured droplet splatter size and distance. RESULTS: The smallest droplet detected was ≅ 120 μm and the largest ≅ 24,000 μm. We detected an average of 25,862 spots in the ST, compared with 11,430 in the LAF (56% reduction). The LAF mainly affected the smaller droplets (<1000 microns). The surface area covered with droplets was: 6% at 50 cm, 1% at 2 m and 0.5% at 3 m in the ST; and 3%, 0.5% and 0.2% in the LAF respectively. CONCLUSION: Accurate mapping droplet spread in clinical environments is possible using fluorescein staining and image analysis. The laminar flow affected the smaller droplets but had limited effect on larger droplets in our AGP cough model. Our results indicate that LAF require similar post-surgery cleaning to those of ST and staff should consider full PPE for medium and high-risk patients.","Newsom, Richard; Amara, Adam; Hicks, Alexander; Quint, Matthew; Pattison, Chris; Bzdek, Bryan R.; Burridge, James; Krawczyk, Coleman; Dinsmore, James; Conway., Joy",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567012100044X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567012100044X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549768/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.01.026,67

597697,Higher solar irradiance is associated with a lower incidence of COVID-19,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: During the 2009 pandemic of an emerging influenza A virus (IAV; H1N1pdm09), data from several European countries indicated that the spread of the virus might have been interrupted by the annual autumn rhinovirus epidemic. We aimed to investigate viral interference between rhinovirus and IAV with use of clinical data and an experimental model. METHODS: We did a clinical data analysis and experimental infection study to investigate the co-occurrence of rhinovirus and IAV in respiratory specimens from adults (≥21 years) tested with a multiplex PCR panel at Yale-New Haven Hospital (CT, USA) over three consecutive winter seasons (Nov 1 to March 1, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19). We compared observed versus expected co-detections using data extracted from the Epic Systems electronic medical record system. To assess how rhinovirus infection affects subsequent IAV infection, we inoculated differentiated primary human airway epithelial cultures with rhinovirus (HRV-01A; multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0·1) or did mock infection. On day 3 post-infection, we inoculated the same cultures with IAV (H1N1 green fluorescent protein [GFP] reporter virus or H1N1pdm09; MOI 0·1). We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR or microscopy to quantify host cell mRNAs for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) on day 3 after rhinovirus or mock infection and IAV RNA on days 4, 5, or 6 after rhinovirus or mock infection. We also did sequential infection studies in the presence of BX795 (6 μM), to inhibit the interferon response. We compared ISG expression and IAV RNA and expression of GFP by IAV reporter virus. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, examination of 8284 respiratory samples positive for either rhinovirus (n=3821) or IAV (n=4463) by any test method was used to establish Nov 1 to March 1 as the period of peak virus co-circulation. After filtering for samples within this time frame meeting the inclusion criteria (n=13 707), there were 989 (7·2%) rhinovirus and 922 (6·7%) IAV detections, with a significantly lower than expected odds of co-detection (odds ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·09–0·28). Rhinovirus infection of cell cultures induced ISG expression and protected against IAV infection 3 days later, resulting in an approximate 50 000-fold decrease in IAV H1N1pdm09 viral RNA on day 5 post-rhinovirus inoculation. Blocking the interferon response restored IAV replication following rhinovirus infection. INTERPRETATION: These findings show that one respiratory virus can block infection with another through stimulation of antiviral defences in the airway mucosa, supporting the idea that interference from rhinovirus disrupted the 2009 IAV pandemic in Europe. These results indicate that viral interference can potentially affect the course of an epidemic, and this possibility should be considered when designing interventions for seasonal influenza epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Serious concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding misinterpretation of data, leading to incorrect and distorted conclusions. The article was evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief with the support of several Editorial Board Members. They found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings. These include, but are not limited to: The data from the Lareb report (https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen) in The Netherlands were used to calculate the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations. Unfortunately, in the manuscript by Harald Walach et al. these data were incorrectly interpreted which led to erroneous conclusions. The data was presented as being causally related to adverse events by the authors. This is inaccurate. In The Netherlands, healthcare professionals and patients are invited to report suspicions of adverse events that may be associated with vaccination. For this type of reporting a causal relation between the event and the vaccine is not needed, therefore a reported event that occurred after vaccination is not necessarily attributable to vaccination. Thus, reporting of a death following vaccination does not imply that this is a vaccine-related event. There are several other inaccuracies in the paper by Harald Walach et al. one of which is that fatal cases were certified by medical specialists. It should be known that even this false claim does not imply causation, which the authors imply. Further, the authors have called the events 'effects' and 'reactions' when this is not established, and until causality is established they are 'events' that may or may not be caused by exposure to a vaccine. It does not matter what statistics one may apply, this is incorrect and misleading. The authors were asked to respond to the claims, but were not able to do so satisfactorily.

598120,To Toci or Not to Toci for COVID-19: Is That Still the Question?,2020-07-31,"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared in March 2020. The first wave of the pandemic was marked by strict epidemiological measures: lockdown, social distancing, and self isolation. Cancer patients receiving systemic oncology treatments were considered a high-risk population regarding COVID19. These new circumstances posed possible obstacles for the treatment continuation, which in turn potentially led to an increase in distress. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on a distress level among cancer patients. Methods: A total of 728 cancer patients, in 9 oncology centers, were approached to participate in the study. The study questionnaire with disease and sociodemographic characteristics was completed by 422 patients. Patients were stratified by cancer type: breast, gastrointestinal (colon, gastric, pancreatic), and other cancer types (lung, prostate, ovarian);and by disease stage, early or metastatic. All patients had to have an ongoing active oncology treatment which required regular visits to outpatient clinics or inpatient oncology departments. Distress level was measured using the Distress Thermometer with a cut-off value of 4. Results: There were 201 (47%) patients with breast cancer, 130 (32%) patients with gastrointestinal cancer (colon, pancreatic and gastric cancer), and 92 (21%) patients with other types of cancer (lung, prostate, ovarian). A total of 192 (46%) patients had early disease stage while 230 (54%) patients had advanced disease, respectively. A high distress level was reported in 189 (44.8%) of all patients. The breast cancer patients had significantly higher levels of distress when comparing with other types of cancer. There was no significant difference in distress level regarding disease stage. Conclusions: Almost every second cancer patient with ongoing active oncology treatment was highly distressed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the disease stage. Breast cancer patients tend to have higher levels of distress when comparing with other cancer types. When evaluating distress during a pandemic one should take into account the possible impact of various aspects of COVID-19 disease and pandemic on a distress level in cancer patients.

To combat the virus, one of the most dramatic measures was the lockdown of 4 billion people in what is believed to be the largest quasi-quarantine in human history. As a response to the call to study information behavior during a global health crisis, we adopted a resource orchestration perspective to investigate six Chinese families who survived the lockdown. We explored how elderly, young and middle-aged individuals and children resourced information and how they adapted their information behavior to emerging online technologies. Two information resource orchestration practices (information resourcing activities and information behavior adaptation activities) and three mechanisms (online emergence and convergence in community resilience, the overcoming of information flow impediments, and the application of absorptive capacity) were identified in the study.","Pan, Shan L.; Cui, Miao; Qian, Jinfang",Int J Inf Manage,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401220306319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394997/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401220306319?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102143,67

The optimal management of hospitalized patients has become a worldwide concern and identification of immune biomarkers predictive of the clinical outcome for hospitalized patients remains a major challenge. Immunophenotyping and transcriptomic analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at admission allow identifying the two categories of patients. Inflammation, high neutrophil activation, dysfunctional monocytic response and a strongly impaired adaptive immune response was observed in patients who will experience the more severe form of the disease. This observation was validated in an independent cohort of patients. Using in silico analysis on drug signature database, we identify differential therapeutics that specifically correspond to each group of patients. From this signature, we propose a score—the SARS-Score—composed of easily quantifiable biomarkers, to classify hospitalized patients upon arrival to adapt treatment according to their immune profile.","Russick, Jules; Foy, Pierre-Emmanuel; Josseaume, Nathalie; Meylan, Maxime; Hamouda, Nadine Ben; Kirilovsky, Amos; Sissy, Carine El; Tartour, Eric; Smadja, David M.; Karras, Alexandre; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien; Livrozet, Marine; Fayol, Antoine; Arlet, Jean-Benoit; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Dragon-Durey, Marie-Agnès; Pagès, Franck; Cremer, Isabelle",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.701273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322128/,67
598998,Respiratory surveillance wards as a strategy to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 through early detection: The experience of a tertiary-care hospital in Singapore,2020-05-08,"The way each country counts and reports the incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections is strongly affected by the ""weekend effect"". During the weekend, fewer tests are carried out and there is a delay in the registration of cases. This introduces an ""administrative noise"" that can strongly disturb the calculation of trend estimators such as the effective reproduction number Rt. In this work we propose a procedure to correct the incidence curve and obtain a better fit between the number of infected and the one expected using the renewal equation. The classic way to deal with the administrative noise is to invoke its weekly period and therefore to filter the incidence curve by a seven days sliding mean. Yet this has three drawbacks: the first one is a loss of resolution. The second one is that a 7-day mean filter hinders the estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt in the last three days before present. The third drawback of a mean filter is that it implicitly assumes the administrative noise to be additive and time invariant. The present study supports the idea that the administrative is better dealt with as being both periodic and multiplicative. The simple method that derives from these assumptions amount to multiplying the number of infected by a correcting factor which depends on the day of the week. This correcting factor is estimated from the incidence curve itself. The validity of the method is demonstrated by its positive impact on the accuracy of an the estimates of Rt. To exemplify the advantages of the multiplicative periodic correction, we apply it to Sweden, Germany, France and Spain. We observe that the estimated administrative noise is country dependent, and that the proposed strategy manages to reduce it noise considerably. An implementation of this technique is available at www.ipol.im/ern, where it can be tested on the daily incidence curves of an extensive list of states and geographic areas provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.","Alvarez, L.; Colom, M.; Morel, J.-M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.16.20232405v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232405,67

However, the extent to which worldwide isolates can undergo sexual reproduction has remained unclear. In this study a global collection of 131 isolates was established with a near 1:1 ratio of mating types. All isolates were crossed to MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 Irish strains, and a subset of isolates from different continents were crossed together. Ninety seven percent of isolates were found to produce cleistothecia with at least one mating partner, showing that sexual fertility is not limited to the Irish population but is a characteristic of global A. fumigatus. However, large variation was seen in numbers of cleistothecia produced per cross, suggesting differences in the possibility for genetic exchange between strains in nature. The majority of crosses produced ascospores with >50% germination rates, but with wide variation evident. A high temperature heat shock was required to induce ascospore germination. Finally, a new set of highly fertile MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 supermater strains were identified and pyrimidine auxotrophs generated for community use. Results provide insights into the potential for the A. fumigatus sexual cycle to generate genetic variation and allow gene flow of medically important traits.","Swilaiman, Sameira S.; O’Gorman, Céline M.; Du, Wenyue; Sugui, Janyce A.; Del Buono, Joanne; Brock, Matthias; Kwon-Chung, Kyung J.; Szakacs, George; Dyer, Paul S.",J Fungi (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/jof6040258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143051/,67

Members of the Thymelaeaceae family have been of interest owing to their excellent medicinal value. Given the successful history of natural product-based drug discovery, extracts from the aerial parts of Thymelaea hirsuta were evaluated for their potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity. Ethyl acetate extracts from leaves (71B) and branches (72B) of Thymelaea hirsuta showed potent and selective activity against HIV-1 wt (EC(50) = 0.8 µg/mL) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (CC(50) > 100 µg/mL). They proved to be active against HIV-1 variants carrying clinically relevant NNRTI and NRTI mutations at low concentration (0.3–4 µg/mL range) and against the M-tropic strain HIV-1 BaL. The 72B extract, chosen as a lead, was not able to inhibit the RT and protease enzymatic functions. Furthermore, it was not virucidal, since exposure of HIV to high concentration did not affect virus infectivity. The pre-clinical safety profile of this extract showed no adverse effect on the growth of Lactobacilli, and non-toxic concentration of the extract did not influence the Caco-2 epithelial cells monolayer integrity. Additionally, extract 72B prevented syncytia formation at low concentration (0.4 µg/mL). The potent inhibitory effect on the syncytia formation in co-cultures showed that 72B inhibits an early event in the replication cycle of HIV. All of these findings prompt us to carry on new studies on Thymelaea hirsuta extracts.","Sanna, Giuseppina; Madeddu, Silvia; Murgia, Giuseppe; Serreli, Gabriele; Begala, Michela; Caboni, Pierluigi; Incani, Alessandra; Franci, Gianluigi; Galdiero, Marilena; Giliberti, Gabriele",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575585/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060664,67

More than twelve million COVID-19 cases and 500 thousand fatalities have been reported in 216 countries. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, comparatively fewer people have been affected in other Asian countries than in Europe and the USA. This study examined the hypothesis that lower temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by comparing attack rate and case fatality rate (until 21 March 2020) to mean temperature in January–February 2020. The attack rate was highest in Luxembourg followed by Italy and Switzerland. There was a significant (p = 0.02) correlation between decreased attack rate and increased environmental temperature. The case fatality rate was highest in Italy followed by Iran and Spain. There was no significant correlation between the case fatality rate and temperature. This study indicates that lower temperature may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as an increased attack rate), but there is no evidence that temperature affects the severity of the disease (measured as case fatality rate). However, there are clearly other factors that affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and many of these may be sensitive to interventions, e.g. through increased public awareness and public health response.","Hassan, Mohammad M.; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.; Khan, Shahneaz A.; Islam, Ariful; Nayem, Md.

However, the experiences of ICU nurses in managing patient safety during an infectious disease outbreak remains unexplored. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To explore ICU nurses' narratives in managing patient safety in the outbreak ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN A narrative inquiry design. METHODS A purposive sample of 18 registered nurses who practiced in the outbreak ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited between June and August 2020. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and narratively analysed. RESULTS Findings reviewed an overarching anatomy-specific storyline of a 'hand-brain-heart' connection that describes nurses' experience with managing patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, stories on 'the hands of clinical practice' revealed how critical care nursing is practiced and adapted by ICU nurses during the pandemic. In particular, ICU nurses banded together to safeguard patient safety by practicing critical care nursing with mastery. Secondly, stories on 'the brain of psychosocial wellness' highlights the tumultuous impact of COVID-19 on the nurses' psychosocial well-being and how nurses demonstrated resilience to continually uphold patient safety during the pandemic. Lastly, stories on 'the heart of nursing' drew upon the nurses' intrinsic professional nursing identity and values to safeguard patient safety. Specific patient tales further boosted the nurses' commitment to render safe nursing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Through their stories, ICU nurses reported how they continually seek to uphold patient safety through clinical competence, resilience, and heightened nursing identity.

In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63.

The results showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with lower mortality in severe COVID-19 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54–0.92, P = 0.009; I(2) = 54.5%). Since the proportion of the RECOVERY (Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial included in the meta-analysis was as high as 71.88%, we removed it and recalculated the pooled OR. The results of the remaining seven studies still suggested such a survival benefit (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44–0.96, P = 0.030; I(2) = 59.8%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that the pooled OR of three studies using corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment was much lower (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.25–0.57, P < 0.001; I(2) = 47.8%). However, after excluding the RECOVERY trial, the pooled OR of the remaining four studies with unspecific administration timing of corticosteroid therapy no longer supported this result (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.69–1.17, P = 0.415; I(2) = 0.0%). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, evidence based on seven randomized controlled trials and one prospective cohort study indicates that corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduction in the mortality of severe COVID-19, especially when administered at an earlier time.","Li, Han; Yan, Bingdi; Gao, Rong; Ren, Jin; Yang, Junling",Int Immunopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921007578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492533/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921007578?v=s5,67

Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD. This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Statins, with their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, have the potential to reduce severity of lung injury in, and mortality from, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Statin-induced upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has the potential to reduce lung injury from excess angiotensin II. By disrupting lipid rafts, statins have the potential to reduce viral entry into cells. However, benefit-risk ratio of its complex interaction with MYD88 gene expression on outcomes in COVID-19, and the putative role of low serum LDL cholesterol in increasing severity of SARS-CoV2 infection need further clarification. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19, who are already on statins for an underlying co-morbid condition, should continue on it unless there are specific contraindications. De-novo use of statins in people with COVID-19 with no underlying co-morbidity might be beneficial but awaits substantiation in clinical trials; till that time, de novo use of statins in COVID 19 should be limited to a clinical trial setting.","Subir, Ray; Jagat J, Mukherjee; Kalyan K, Gangopadhyay",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683320/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.07.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120302599; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120302599?v=s5,67

Part of the diagnosis and follow-up includes medical imaging of the thorax for detection of lung metastases. A Python script was created and trained using a set of lung X-rays and concordant CT scans from a high-volume German-speaking sarcoma center. It is capable of detecting malignant metastasis in the lung with a precision of 71.2%, specificity of 90.5%, sensitivity of 94% and accuracy of 91.2%. Furthermore, the program was able to detect even small nodules with a size <1 cm in conventional X-rays of the thorax. This algorithm was implemented into our daily clinical practice alongside with the radiologists’ findings. With this tool we aim to improve the quality of our service and reduce the expenditure of time. ABSTRACT: Introduction: soft tissue sarcomas are a subset of malignant tumors that are relatively rare and make up 1% of all malignant tumors in adulthood. Due to the rarity of these tumors, there are significant differences in quality in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. One paramount aspect is the diagnosis of hematogenous metastases in the lungs. Guidelines recommend routine lung imaging by means of X-rays. With the ever advancing AI-based diagnostic support, there has so far been no implementation for sarcomas. The aim of the study was to utilize AI to obtain analyzes regarding metastasis on lung X-rays in the most possible sensitive and specific manner in sarcoma patients. Methods: a Python script was created and trained using a set of lung X-rays with sarcoma metastases from a high-volume German-speaking sarcoma center. 26 patients with lung metastasis were included. For all patients chest X-ray with corresponding lung CT scans, and histological biopsies were available. The number of trainable images were expanded to 600. In order to evaluate the biological sensitivity and specificity, the script was tested on lung X-rays with a lung CT as control. Results: in this study we present a new type of convolutional neural network-based system with a precision of 71.2%, specificity of 90.5%, sensitivity of 94%, recall of 94% and accuracy of 91.2%. A good detection of even small findings was determined. Discussion: the created script establishes the option to check lung X-rays for metastases at a safe level, especially given this rare tumor entity.","Wallner, Christoph; Alam, Mansoor; Drysch, Marius; Wagner, Johannes Maximilian; Sogorski, Alexander; Dadras, Mehran; von Glinski, Maxi; Reinkemeier, Felix; Becerikli, Mustafa; Heute, Christoph; Nicolas, Volkmar; Lehnhardt, Marcus; Behr, Björn",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638445/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194961,67

Seventy- six patients aged 44.4±23.3 years were admitted to the COVID-19 Unit during the study period. Data was collected from patients' records. Throat and nasal swabs for the RT-PCR COVID-19 were collected. Time to resolution of infection was defined as the number of days from the date of the first COVID-19 positive outcome to the second consecutive negative PCR results. Most patients showed between 1-6 COVID-19 signs and symptoms (71.1%) and the rest were asymptomatic.

607147,Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic Infectors: Hidden Sources of COVID-19 Disease,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND: The swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009 had a slower spread in Europe than expected. The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory viruses and specifically the presence of co-infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1) in hospitalized children during the H1N1 pandemic. A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 502 children with influenza-like illness admitted to inpatient care at a pediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during the 6 months spanning the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: One or more viruses were detected in 61.6% of the samples. Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% co-infections (2–4 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Viral co-infections were relatively common in H1N1 infected hospitalized children and need to be considered when estimating morbidity attributed to H1N1. Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference.","Rhedin, Samuel; Hamrin, Johan; Naucler, Pontus; Bennet, Rutger; Rotzén-Östlund, Maria; Färnert, Anna; Eriksson, Margareta",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23272110/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051491,67

This study aims to evaluate if influenza vaccination in the 2019–2020 season had any effect on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection in a cohort of health workers. During the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Spain, between March and May 2020, a cohort of 11,201 health workers was highly tested by RT-qPCR and/or rapid antibody test when the infection was suspected. Later in June, 8665 of them were tested for total antibodies in serum. A total of 890 (7.9%) health workers were laboratory-confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection by any type of test, while no case of influenza was detected. The adjusted odds ratio between 2019–2020 influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection was the same (1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.24) in both comparisons of positive testers with all others (cohort design) and with negative testers (test-negative design). Among symptomatic patients tested by RT-qPCR, the comparison of positive cases and negative controls showed an adjusted odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68–1.08).

We could recently demonstrate that MCC-IMS of breath is able to identify Influenza-A infected patients. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we extended our study to the analysis of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. 51 patients, 23m, 28f, aged 64 +/- 16 years, were included in this study. Besides RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs all patients underwent MCC-IMS analysis of breath. 16 patients, 7m, 9f, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. There was no difference in gender or age according to the groups. Stepwise canonical discriminant analysis could correctly classify the infected and non- infected subjects in 98% by cross-validation. Afterwards we combined the Influenza-A sub study and the SARS-CoV-2- sub study for a total of 75 patients, 34m, 41f, aged 64.8 +/- 1.8 years, 14 positive for Influenza-A, 16 positive for SARS-CoV-2, the remaining 44 patients were used as controls. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but inconclusive. There was no imbalance between the groups for age or gender. 97.3% of the patients could be correctly classified to the respective group by discriminant analysis. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination function.

608309,Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on healthcare-associated infections: An update and perspective,2021-03-12,"SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is an attractive target for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) drug discovery, and its dimerization has been extensively proved to be indispensable for enzymatic activity. However, the reason why the dissociated monomer is inactive still remains unclear due to the absence of the monomer structure. In this study, we showed that mutation of the dimer-interface residue Gly-11 to alanine entirely abolished the activity of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). Subsequently, we determined the crystal structure of this mutant and discovered a complete crystallographic dimer dissociation of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). The mutation might shorten the α-helix A′ of domain I and cause a mis-oriented N-terminal finger that could not correctly squeeze into the pocket of another monomer during dimerization, thus destabilizing the dimer structure. Several structural features essential for catalysis and substrate recognition are severely impaired in the G11A monomer. Moreover, domain III rotates dramatically against the chymotrypsin fold compared with the dimer, from which we proposed a putative dimerization model for SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). As the first reported monomer structure for SARS-CoV 3CL(pro), the crystal structure of G11A mutant might provide insight into the dimerization mechanism of the protease and supply direct structural evidence for the incompetence of the dissociated monomer.","Chen, Shuai; Hu, Tiancen; Zhang, Jian; Chen, Jing; Chen, Kaixian; Ding, Jianping; Jiang, Hualiang; Shen, Xu",J Biol Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820714158; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820714158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17977841/,67

Genome-wide analyses and recombination have rarely been conducted, as small numbers of samples and limited genomic characterization have previously prevented further analyses. Herein, we report a unique CRCoV strain, denoted strain BJ232, derived from a CRCoV-positive dog with a mild respiratory infection. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome of all available coronaviruses consistently show that CRCoV BJ232 is most closely related to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and BCoV, forming a separate clade that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. Based on the phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis we propose that CRCoV-K37 was derived from genetic recombination between CRCoV-BJ232 and BCoV. In detail, spike (S) gene of CRCoV-K37 clustered with CRCoV-BJ232. However orf1ab, membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were more related to Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) than CRCoV-B232. Molecular epidemic analysis confirmed the prevalence of CRCoV-BJ232 lineage around the world for a long time.

610554,Effects of the Na(+)/H(+) Ion Exchanger on Susceptibility to COVID-19 and the Course of the Disease,2021-06-15,"Although clinical manifestations of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), are mainly respiratory symptoms, patients can also develop severe cardiovascular damage. Therefore, understanding the damage caused by SARS-COV-2 to the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms is fundamental. The cardiovascular damage may be related to the imbalance of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) as this virus binds the Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on the lung alveolar epithelial cells, to enter into cells. Virus internalization may cause a downregulation of ACE2 on host cell surface that could lead to a local increased level of angiotensin II (AII) and a reduced level of angiotensin 1-7 (A1-7). An imbalance between these angiotensins may be responsible for the lung and heart damage. Pharmacological strategies that interfere with the viral attachment to ACE2 (umifenovir and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine) or that modulate the RAS (analogous of A1-7 and ACE2, losartan) are in clinical development for COVID-19. The use of RAS inhibitors has also become a matter of public concern as these drugs may increase the mRNA expression and levels of ACE2 and impact the virulence and transmission of SARS-COV-2. Data on the effect of RAS inhibitors on ACE2 mRNA expression are scarce. Scientific societies expressed their opinion on continuing the therapy with RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, RAS may play a role in SARS-COV-2-induced cardiac and pulmonary damage. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of RAS in COVID-19 and to guide decision on the use of RAS inhibitors.","Mascolo, Annamaria; Scavone, Cristina; Rafaniello, Concetta; Ferrajolo, Carmen; Racagni, Giorgio; Berrino, Liberato; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Rossi, Francesco; Capuano, Annalisa",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850989/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00143,67

To investigate whether the vaccine provides protective immunity effectively, the amount and function of vaccine-induced antibodies were evaluated. Methods Sera from 13-17 days after the second dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine were collected from healthcare workers at the University of Toyama (n=740). Antibody levels were quantitatively measured by the anti-receptor binding domain antibody test (anti-RBD test), and neutralising activity against pseudotyped viruses displaying wild-type (WT) and mutant spike proteins (B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants) were assayed using a high-throughput chemiluminescent reduction neutralising test (htCRNT). Basic clinical characteristics were obtained from questionnaires. Results Antibodies were confirmed in all participants in both the anti-RBD test (median 2112 U/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 1275-3390 U/mL) and the htCRNT against WT (median % inhibition >99.9, IQR >99.9 to >99.9). For randomly selected sera (n=61), 100.0% were positive for htCRNT against the B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-derived variants. Among those who answered the questionnaire (n=237), the values of the anti-RBD test were negatively correlated with age for females (p<0.01; r = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.45 to -0.16).

REVIEW DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: A search of the databases Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was conducted from January-February 2019. METHOD: This systematic review adhered to The PRISMA Statement. Study selection was managed using the Covidence software platform and quality was assessed using JBI Critical appraisal tools. Studies included adults >18 years and described the role and impact of APNs in care of patients following fragility hip fracture on clinical and non-clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There were 19 papers identified that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Quality was graded as moderate to low risk of bias. Six characteristics of APNs were identified: (1) coordination; (2) collaboration; (3) education; (4) assessment, investigation and treatment recommendations; (5) discharge planning, support and follow up; and (6) documentation. Overall mortality and LOS improved when characteristics of the APN role were present. CONCLUSION: Key findings from this systematic review showed: (1) The APN title and role are not clearly defined, but characteristics of the APN role are evident; (2) characteristics of APNs promote the delivery of best practice hip fracture care and have a positive impact on mortality and LOS; and (3) innovative service delivery models involving APNs should be considered to address future projections of hip fracture rates and improve outcomes. IMPACT: This systematic review provides evidence of the role characteristics of APNs in fragility hip fracture and the impact of the role on outcomes. Findings from this research could be used to develop service delivery models using APNs to care for patients following fragility hip fracture and to inform practice where APN roles may improve outcomes for other patient cohorts.","Allsop, Sharon; Morphet, Julia; Lee, Susan; Cook, Olivia",J Adv Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320350/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14692,67

However, there is still a lack of a simple and effective tool to identify these patients early. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to develop an early warning model for predicting the death risk of COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the cases were used to construct the prediction model, and the remaining 25% were used to verify the prediction model based on data immediately available on admission. Results: From March 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020, a total of 4,711 COVID-19 patients were included in our study. The average age was 63.37 ± 16.70 years, of which 1,148 (24.37%) died. Finally, age, SpO2, body temperature (T), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were selected for constructing the model by univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and a review of the literature. We used five common methods for constructing the model and finally found that the full model had the best specificity and higher accuracy. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of full model in train cohort were, respectively, 0.798 (0.779, 0.816), 0.804, 0.656, and 0.768, and in the validation cohort were, respectively, 0.783 (0.751, 0.815), 0.800, 0.616, and 0.755. Visualization tools of the prediction model included a nomogram and an online dynamic nomogram (https://wanghai.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). Conclusion: We developed a prediction model that might aid in the early identification of COVID-19 patients with a high probability of mortality on admission.

The characteristics of hMPV-infected adults are unclear because few cases have been reported. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized adult patients with a positive multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result from 2012 to 2016 at a single tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. We analyzed clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients and divided patients into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) group and a non-ARDS group. RESULTS: In total, 110 adults were reviewed in this study. Their mean age was 61.4 years, and the majority (n = 105, 95.5%) had comorbidities or were immunocompromised. Most of the patients had pneumonia on chest X-ray (n = 88, 93.6%), 22 (20.0%) had ARDS, and 12 (10.9%) expired during hospitalization. The mortality rate for patients with ARDS was higher than that of the other patients (36.4% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was heart failure (odds ratio, 5.24; P = 0.044) and laboratory values were increased blood urea nitrogen and increased C-reactive protein. The acquisition site of infection was divided into community vs. nosocomial; 43 patients (39.1%) had a nosocomial infection. The risk factors for nosocomial infection were an immunocompromised state, malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hMPV is one of the important respiratory pathogens important respiratory pathogen that causes pneumonia/ARDS in elderly, immunocompromised individuals and that it may be transmitted via the nosocomial route.","Hwang, Hyunjung; Kim, Yujin; Park, Jeong-Woong; Jeong, Sung Hwan; Kyung, Sun Young",Korean J Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.4266/kjccm.2017.00038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31723632/,67

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, BioRxiv and MedRxiv, and Cochrane (up to April 20, 2021) were the search databases. Two reviewers (SK and CK) independently selected the electronic published literature that studied the effect of nitric oxide with SOC or control. The clinical and physiological outcomes such as prevention of progressive systemic de-oxygenation/clinical improvement, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, improvement in pulmonary arterial pressure, and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: The 14 retrospective/protective studies randomly assigning 423 patients met the inclusion criteria. Cumulative study of the selected articles showed that iNO has a mild impact on ventilation time or ventilator-free days. iNO has increased the partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of fraction of inspired oxygen in a few patients as compared to baseline. However, in most of the studies, it does not have better outcome when compared to the baseline improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome, nitric oxide is linked to a slight increase in oxygenation but has no effect on mortality.","Prakash, Ajay; Kaur, Sukhmeet; Kaur, Charanjeet; Prabha, Praisy K.; Bhatacharya, Anusuya; Sarma, Phulen; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169911/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijp.ijp_382_21,67

This highly infectious disease is associated with respiratory failure unusual in other coronavirus infections. Mounting evidence link the accelerated progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the “cytokine storm” involving major systemic perturbations. These include iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia associated with disease severity. Iron dysregulation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes oxidative stress. The mitochondria are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis. In addition, the mitochondria may circulate “cell-free” in non-nucleated platelets, in extracellular vesicles and mitochondrial DNA is found in the extracellular space. The heightened inflammatory/oxidative state may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to platelet damage and apoptosis. The interaction of dysfunctional platelets with coagulation cascades aggravates clotting events and thrombus formation. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbiota dysbiosis, altering coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response leading to the vicious cycle of events. Here, we discuss various cellular and systemic incidents caused by SARS-CoV-2 that may critically impact intra and extracellular mitochondrial function, and contribute to the progression and severity of the disease. It is crucial to understand how these key modulators impact COVID-19 pathogenesis in the quest to identify novel therapeutic targets that may reduce fatal outcomes of the disease.","Saleh, Jumana; Peyssonnaux, Carole; Singh, Keshav K; Edeas, Marvin",Mitochondrion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2020.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567724920301380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574708/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724920301380,67

Many SARS patients suffer respiratory distress brought on by interstitial infiltration and frequently show peripheral blood lymphopenia and occasional leucopenia. One possible cause of this could be interstitial inflammation, following a localized host response. In this study, we therefore examine the immune response of SARS-CoV in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over the first 24 hours. METHODS: PBMCs from normal healthy donors were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV and the viral replication kinetics was studied by real-time quantitative assays. SARS-CoV specific gene expression changes were examined by high-density oligonucleotide array analysis. RESULTS: We observed that SARS-CoV was capable of infecting and replicating in PBMCs and the kinetics of viral replication was variable among the donors. SARS-CoV antibody binding assays indicated that SARS specific antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication. Array data showed monocyte-macrophage cell activation, coagulation pathway upregulation and cytokine production together with lung trafficking chemokines such as IL8 and IL17, possibly activated through the TLR9 signaling pathway; that mimicked clinical features of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of human blood mononuclear cells as a direct target of SARS-CoV in the model system described here provides a new insight into disease pathology and a tool for investigating the host response and mechanisms of pathogenesis.","Ng, Lisa FP; Hibberd, Martin L; Ooi, Eng-Eong; Tang, Kin-Fai; Neo, Soek-Ying; Tan, Jenny; Krishna Murthy, Karuturi R; Vega, Vinsensius B; Chia, Jer-Ming; Liu, Edison T; Ren, Ee-Chee",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15357874/,67
616041,Nanomedicine for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2017-06-27,"The damage of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reaching unprecedented scales. There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast the epidemics, these classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here we propose a data-driven, parameter-free approach to access the fragility and systemic risk of epidemic networks by studying the Forman-Ricci curvature. Network curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can be translated for COVID-19 epidemic time series as well. We first show that our hypothesis is true in a toy-model of epidemic time series with delays, which generates epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Forman-Ricci curvature can be a parameter-free estimate for the fragility and risk of the network at each stage of the simulated pandemic. On this basis, we then compute the Forman-Ricci curvature for real epidemic networks built from epidemic time series available from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Forman-Ricci curvature allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of the method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for epidemics, without the need of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling. The strategy above, together with other data-driven tools for investigating epidemic network dynamics, can be readily implemented on a daily basis to quickly estimate the growth, risk and fragility of real COVID-19 epidemic networks at different scales.","de Souza, Danillo Barros; Santos, Fernando A N; Figueiroa, Everlon; Correia, Jailson B; da Silva, Hernande P; Filho, Jose Luiz de Lima; Albuquerque, Jones",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047225,67

Hence, modulating ACE2 might impact SARS‐CoV‐2 viral replication, shedding and COVID‐19 severity. Here, we investigated if the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker valsartan alters the expression of renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) components, including ACE2, in human adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial, in which 36 participants (BMI 31.0±0.8 kg/m(2)) with impaired glucose metabolism received either valsartan or placebo for 26 weeks. Before and after 26 weeks treatment, abdominal subcutaneous AT and skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained, and gene expression of RAS components was measured by qRT‐PCR. RESULTS: Valsartan treatment did not significantly impact the expression of RAS components, including ACE2, in AT and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Given the pivotal role of ACE2 in SARS‐CoV‐2 spread and the clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 patients, our data suggest that the putative beneficial effects of ARBs on the clinical outcomes in patients with COVID‐19 may not be mediated through altered ACE2 expression in abdominal subcutaneous AT.","de Ligt, Marlies; Hesselink, Matthijs K.C.; Jorgensen, Johanna; Jocken, Johan W.E.; Blaak, Ellen E.; Goossens, Gijs H.",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955183/; https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23221,67

Using a large electronic health record database, we characterized clinical and testing data for 23 patients with repeatedly positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results ≥60 days apart, separated by ≥2 consecutive negative test results. The prevalence of chronic medical conditions, symptoms, and severe outcomes related to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) illness were ascertained. The median age of patients was 64.5 years, 40% were Black, and 39% were female. A total of 83% smoked within the prior year, 61% were overweight/obese, 83% had immunocompromising conditions, and 96% had ≥2 comorbidities. The median interval between the two positive tests was 77 days. Among the 19 patients with 60 to 89 days between positive tests, 17 (89%) exhibited symptoms or clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19 at the time of the second positive test and 14 (74%) were hospitalized at the second positive test. Of the four patients with ≥90 days between two positive tests (patient 2 [PT2], PT8, PT14, and PT19), two had mild or no symptoms at the second positive test and one, an immunocompromised patient, had a brief hospitalization at the first diagnosis, followed by intensive care unit (ICU) admission at the second diagnosis 3 months later. Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of compromised immune systems, comorbidities, obesity, and smoking among patients with repeatedly positive SARS-CoV-2 tests.

Here, we report a case of a 62‐year‐old woman who had received this vaccine and developed VIPIT. She visited the emergency ward because of petechiae and hematomas. In the laboratory work‐up, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, elevated D‐dimer, and positivity in the platelet factor 4/heparin‐enzyme‐immunoassay were present. Signs and symptoms of thrombosis were absent. Upon immediate therapy with non‐heparin anticoagulation, high‐dose IVIG, and prednisolone, laboratory parameters steadily improved and the patient was discharged from hospital without thrombotic complications.

Crowding and congestions in parks has been a perennial problem and the ability to socially distance within them is an unproven assumption. Is it possible to socially distance in a busy national park that has been designed to concentrate use? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An observational study was conducted in July 2020 at the outside foyer of the Visitor Center of Arches National Park. Motion sensor cameras were placed to record one-minute videos when a person entered the field of view. Number of groups, group size, facial coverings and encounters within 6 feet (1.83 meters) of other groups were recorded. Groups were smaller on average than recorded in previous studies. Approximately 61% of the visitors wore masks. Most groups (69%) were able to experience the visitor center with no intergroup encounters. We model the probability of intergroup encounters and find as group size and number of groups increases, the probability of encounters rises. With four groups present, the probability of one or more encounters ranges from 19% to 40% for common group sizes, while if eight groups are present, the probability of one or more encounters increases from 34% to 64% for common group sizes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under conditions in which park visitors have the physical space to avoid close encounters with other groups they are taking advantage of the opportunity. Visitors are minimizing group size, wearing masks, and remaining socially distant. However, encounters increase as the number or the size of the groups increases. In other areas of the parks this ability to avoid encounters may not be as possible. We recommend that park managers continue to appeal for compliance with CDC guidelines, especially the wearing of masks and encouraging visitors to split up into small groups when visiting.","Miller, Zachary D.; Freimund, Wayne; Dalenberg, Douglas; Vega, Madison",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617574/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247315,67

Surgery is also considered an acceptable standard infit patients with oligometastatic lesions in the lungs. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide issues with access to operating room time, with patients and physicians facing uncertainty as to when surgical resection will be available, with likely delays of months. Further compounding this are concerns about increased risks of respiratory complications with lung cancer surgery during active phases of the pandemic. In this setting, many thoracic oncology teams are embracing a paradigm where stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is used as a bridge, to provide radical-intent treatment based on a combination of immediate SABR followed by planned surgery in 3–6 months. This pragmatic approach to treatment has been named SABR-BRIDGE (Stereotactic ABlative Radiotherapy Before Resection to avoId Delay for early-stage lunG cancer or oligomEts). This term has also been applied to the pragmatic study of the outcomes of this approach. In this paper, we discuss the standards of care in treatment of early-stage (NSCLC) and pulmonary oligometastases, the impetus for the SABR-BRIDGE approach, and the controversies surrounding assessment of pathological response to neo-adjuvant radiation therapy.","Kidane, Biniam; Spicer, Jonathan; Kim, Julian O.; Fiset, Pierre-Olivier; Abdulkarim, Bassam; Malthaner, Richard; Palma, David",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.580189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072612/,67

625501,COVID-19 and essential pregnant worker policies,2020-06-02,"Die schnarrende Stimme John Bercows, Speaker des Britischen Unterhauses, wird noch eine Weile erinnert werden. Seine „ Order! “-Rufe während der hitzigen Brexit-Debatten des Jahres 2019 und sein Verweis auf parlamentarische Regeln aus dem Jahr 1604, welcher eine wiederholte Abstimmung über einen unveränderten Brexit-Antrag verhinderte, verschafften ihm allerdings auch etliche Animositäten. Notwendig waren seine beherzten Zwischenrufe in diesen turbulenten Zeiten allemal, der sonst übliche Sitz im Oberhaus im Anschluss an seine Zeit als Sprecher wurde ihm allerdings verwehrt. Dass die Corona-Krise neue Turbulenzen zeitgleich zu den Austrittsverhandlungen hervorbringen würde, kam für das Vereinigte Königreich ebenso überraschend wie für die Europäische Union. Dass in Deutschland diese turbulenten Zeiten bisher vergleichsweise gut bewältigt wurden – bisher ohne erkennbare Einschränkungen einer bestmöglichen gesundheitlichen Versorgung zumindest bei COVID-19-Patienten – ist eine erhebliche Leistung von vielen. Eine der Stimmen in den COVID-19-Turbulenzen, welche in zeitgeschichtlicher Erinnerung bleiben werden, ist die des Generaldirektors der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus von Mitte März 2020: „ Man kann ein Feuer nicht blind bekämpfen und wir können dieser Pandemie nicht Einhalt gebieten, wenn wir nicht wissen, wer infiziert ist. Wir haben eine einfache Botschaft für alle Länder: testen, testen, testen. Testen Sie jeden Verdachtsfall. Bei einem positiven Testergebnis isolieren Sie diesen und finden Sie die Kontaktpersonen “ 1 . Diese Botschaft verbreitete sich nachfolgend in verkürzter Form als kulturelles Mem „testen, testen, testen“ gleichsam selbst viral über das Internet und andere Kommunikationskanäle. Innerhalb Deutschlands wurde dieser Botschaft jedenfalls entsprochen: Waren in den ersten 10 Kalenderwochen des Jahres 2020 insgesamt 125 000 Abstrichuntersuchungen mittels Reverse-Transkriptase-Polymerase-Kettenreaktion (RT-PCR) vorgenommen worden, wurden bereits einen Monat nach diesem Aufruf wöchentlich etwa 400 000 Testungen durchgeführt.

The current health care strategies have primarily focused on either the pathogen on the environmental factors. However, efforts towards strengthening the host immunity are important from public health perspective to prevent the spread of infection and downregulate the potency of the agent. While a vaccine can induce specific immunity in the host, non-specific ways of improving overall host immunity are the need. This scenario has paved the way for the use of traditional Indian therapies such as Ayurveda and Yoga. This review aims at collating available evidence on Ayurveda, Yoga and COVID-19. Further, it draws inferences from recent studies on Yoga and Ayurveda on immunity, respiratory health and mental health respectively to approximate its probable role in prophylaxis and as an add-on management option for the current pandemic.","Umesh, Chikkanna; Ramakrishna, Kishore Kumar; Jasti, Nishitha; Bhargav, Hemant; Varambally, Shivarama",J Ayurveda Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305355/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0975947621001418?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0975947621001418; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.009,67

Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only distressed medical services but also caused economic upheavals, marking urgent the need for effective therapeutics. The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibitory activity of these repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro highlights their therapeutic potential for treating COVID-19 and other Betacoronavirus infections.","Chiou, Wei-Chung; Hsu, Meng-Shiuan; Chen, Yun-Ti; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Tsay, Yeou-Guang; Huang, Hsiu-Chen; Huang, Cheng",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430659/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2020.1850710,67

Mixed messages were given about its risk and how to contain it, when trust in authorities and reliable scientific information are essential to reduce unnecessary scares and inappropriate risk perceptions. We know little about public concerns and opinions in health authorities in the Arab world. Thus, an attempt was made to generate such information through a web-based survey. A total of 1074 subjects from Lebanon, Jordan, and Tunisia were recruited to explore their perception of food and non-food risks of infection and the influence of the source of information, trust, and attitudes towards the local authorities' communication of risk. Seventy percent of the respondents were concerned that COVID-19 may be transmitted through food. The perception of risk from touching contaminated surfaces and food packaging and being exposed to infected people during food shopping was even higher. For only less than half of the respondents, the information from local authorities was considered trustworthy and the associated risk communication and response to false rumors were timely, effective, and clear. But the satisfaction level among the Jordanians was remarkably stronger than for the Lebanese and Tunisian respondents. The demographic factors, trust in information, and attitudes towards authorities' performance in risk communication did not influence risk perceptions. Respondents’ knowledge was limited based on their chief sources of information, such as social media, local news media broadcasts, and announcements by the World Health Organization. Our conclusion is that unnecessary fear increases among the public when risks that impact heath are unknown. More research in the Arab region is needed to understand the determinants of risk perceptions considering psychological factors on the risk to health. Unfortunately, it is difficult to restrict or contain misleading information from various forms of social media. We recommend that for reducing fear and building confidence with the public for appropriate action during the pandemic, local authorities should enhance the quality and level of details of the information that they share during such crises.","Faour-Klingbeil, Dima; Osaili, Tareq M.; Al-Nabulsi, Anas A.; Jemni, Monia; Todd, Ewen C.D.",Food Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713520305338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519101/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956713520305338; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107617,67

However, the people’s rising enthusiasm has been blunted in late February 2021 by the report of several cases of unusual thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Vaxzevria), and a few months later also after Ad26.COV2. S vaccines. Of note, both products used an Adenovirus-based (AdV) platform to deliver the mRNA molecule - coding for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A clinical entity characterized by cerebral and/or splanchnic vein thrombosis, often associated with multiple thromboses, with thrombocytopenia and bleeding, and sometimes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), was soon recognized as a new syndrome, named vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). VITT was mainly observed in females under 55 years of age, between 4 and 16 days after receiving only Adenovirus-based vaccine and displayed a seriously high fatality rate. This prompted the Medicine Regulatory Agencies of various countries to enforce the pharmacovigilance programs, and to provide some advices to restrict the use of AdV-based vaccines to some age groups. This point-of view is aimed at providing a comprehensive review of epidemiological issues, pathogenetic hypothesis and treatment strategies of this rare but compelling syndrome, thus helping physicians to offer an up-to dated and evidence-based counseling to their often alarmed patients.","Marcucci, Rossella; Marietta, Marco",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191218/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02793-x,67

632936,The Multidimensional Challenge of Treating COVID-19: Remdesivir is a Foot in the Door,2020-07-31,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread implementation of public health measures, such as stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and masking mandates. In addition to decreasing spread of SARS-CoV2, these measures also impact the transmission of seasonal viral pathogens, which are common triggers of COPD exacerbations. Whether reduced viral prevalence mediates reduction in COPD exacerbation rates is unknown. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter healthcare system to assess admission trends associated with community viral prevalence and with initiation of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. We applied difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to compare season-matched weekly frequency of hospital admissions for COPD before and after implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Community viral prevalence was estimated using regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention test positivity data and correlated to COPD admissions. Results: Data involving 4,422 COPD admissions demonstrated a season-matched 53% decline in COPD admissions during COVID-19 pandemic, which correlated to community viral burden (r=0.73; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.78) and represented a 36% greater decline over admission frequencies observed in other medical conditions less affected by respiratory viral infections (IRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71, p<0.001). The post-COVID-19 decline in COPD admissions was most pronounced in patients with fewer comorbidities and without recurrent admissions. Conclusion: The implementation of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased COPD admissions. These changes are plausibly explained by reduced prevalence of seasonal respiratory viruses.","So, J. Y.; O'Hara, N. N.; Kenaa, B.; Williams, J. G.; DeBorja, C.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case series in which vMGII score along with virtual Single Simple Question (vSSQ), virtual Patient‐Acceptable Symptom State PASS (vPASS) response, and patient disease status based on Myathenia Gravis Foundation of America postintervention status were collected during telephone consultation along with the MGII, SSQ, and PASS responses during the preceding in‐person clinic visits. RESULTS: In 214 patients, the mean difference of vMGII between the vPASS “Yes” and “No” groups was −14.2 ± 1.4 (95% confidence interval, −16.9 to −11.3; P < .001) with mean vMGII for vPASS “Yes” group being 6.4 ± 7.7 and vPASS “No” being 20.5 ± 11.5. A vMGII of 11.5 or higher predicted vPASS “yes” response with a sensitivity of 78.7% and specificity of 81.4%. A strong negative correlation was found between the vMGII and vSSQ (r = −.667; P < .001). The mean vMGII was 0.48 ± 1.42 for patients in remission, and 9.31 ± 10.93 for improved, 9.32 ± 8.79 for stable, and 22.58 ± 14.04 for worsened groups (P < .001). These associations were the same as those obtained during the preceding in‐person clinic visit and the direction of change in MGII scores also indicated change in disease status. DISCUSSION: vMGII is an effective measure to assess an MG patient's disease status in telephone consultations and relates well with other PRO measures. The vMGII remains reliable for assessing MG disease status even with removal of the physical examination component.","Menon, Deepak; Alnajjar, Sara; Barnett, Carolina; Vijayan, Joy; Katzberg, Hans; Fathi, Davood; Alcantara, Monica; Bril, Vera",Muscle Nerve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792967/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27243,67

The symptoms of a COVID-19 infection are usually mild in the healthy population below the age of 65; however, the measures laid down to prevent the spread of the virus apply typically to the whole population. Hence, those who have a low risk of severe symptoms face a social dilemma in cooperating and complying with the safety measures: Cooperating in preventing the spread of the disease is good for society but comes with individual costs. These costs provide an incentive not to cooperate with the safety measures. In this paper we analyze via structural equation modelling a sample of young adults (N = 510) who were surveyed right after the end of the first lockdown period in Switzerland. We investigate why and to what extent they cooperated in preventing the epidemic by following the recommendation to stay at home as much as possible. We hypothesize that those respondents who perceive themselves to be personally at risk, or who have relatives belonging to the risk group, complied more often with the safety measures as compared to those without severe risks. Cooperating should also be linked to individuals’ pro-social orientation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Franzen, Axel; Wöhner, Fabienne",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606826/,67

Here, we analyzed the frequency of Q677P/H and FCS point mutations in 1,144,793 human and 1042 animal spike protein sequences and from those of the emergent variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429 + B.1.427, and B.1.525, which were deposited in the database of the GISAID Initiative. Different genetic polymorphisms, particularly P681H and A688V, were detected in the FCS, mainly in human isolates, and otherwise, only pangolin and bat sequences had these mutations. Multiple FCS amino acid deletions such as Δ(680)SPRRA(684) and Δ(685)RSVA(688) were only detected in eight and four human isolates, respectively. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire FCS motif as Δ(680)SPRRARSVA(688) and Δ(680)SPRRARSVAS(689) was detected only in three human isolates. On the other hand, analysis of FCS from emergent variants showed no deletions in the FCS except for spike P681del, which was detected in seven B.1.1.7 isolates from the USA. Spike Q677P was detected only once in variant, B.1.1.7, whereas Q677H was detected in all variants, i.e., B.1.1.7 (n = 1938), B.1.351 (n = 28), P.1 (n = 9), B.1.429 + B.1.427 (n = 132), and B.1.525 (n = 1584). Structural modeling predicted that mutations or deletions at or near the FCS significantly alter the cleavage loop structure and would presumably affect furin binding. Taken together, our results show that Q677H and FCS point mutations are prevalent and may have various biological effects on the circulating variants. Therefore, we recommend urgent monitoring and surveillance of the investigated mutations, as well as laboratory assessment of their pathogenicity and transmissibility.","Nagy, Abdou; Basiouni, Shereen; Parvin, Rokshana; Hafez, Hafez M.; Shehata, Awad A.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258664/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05166-z,67

639674,"Rare Adult Subtype of Rhabdomyosarcoma, a Common Childhood Soft Tissue Carcinoma",2021-08-30,"OBJECTIVE: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for timely data from the healthcare systems for research. To meet this need, several large new data consortia have developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and post-processing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21(st) Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.","Lenert, Leslie A; Ilatovskiy, Andrey V; Agnew, James; Rudsill, Patricia; Jacobs, Jeff; Weatherston, Duncan; Deans, Kenneth",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993254/,67

DESIGN: UK population-based survey conducted during August and September 2020. Correlates of help-seeking behaviour were modelled using logistic regression in participants reporting potential cancer symptoms during the previous 6 months. Qualitative telephone interviews with a purposeful subsample of participants, analysed thematically. SETTING: Online UK wide survey. PARTICIPANTS: 7543 adults recruited via Cancer Research UK online panel provider (Dynata) and HealthWise Wales (a national register of ‘research ready’ participants) supplemented with social media (Facebook and Twitter) recruitment. 30 participants were also interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey measures included experiences of 15 potential cancer symptoms, help-seeking behaviour, barriers and prompts to help-seeking. RESULTS: Of 3025 (40.1%) participants who experienced a potential cancer symptom, 44.8% (1355/3025) had not contacted their general practitioner (GP). Odds of help-seeking were higher among participants with disability (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.71) and who experienced more symptoms (aOR=1.68, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.82), and lower among those who perceived COVID-19 as the cause of symptom(s) (aOR=0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.52). Barriers included worries about wasting the doctor’s time (1158/7543, 15.4%), putting strain on healthcare services (945, 12.6%) and not wanting to make a fuss (907, 12.0%). Interviewees reported reluctance to contact the GP due to concerns about COVID-19 and fear of attending hospitals, and described putting their health concerns on hold. CONCLUSIONS: Many people avoided healthcare services despite experiencing potential cancer symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside current help-seeking campaigns, well-timed and appropriate nationally coordinated campaigns should signal that services are open safely for those with unusual or persistent symptoms.

The same pattern seems not to apply to a conventional suicide method, unless it was used by a celebrity. OBJECTIVE: 1) to examine media effects on both new and non-new suicide methods during 1998 and 2005 in Hong Kong (HK), when a new method by burning charcoal (CB suicide) was spreading in the region. 2) to examine how CB competed with non-CB methods in terms of media coverage and “recruiting” suicidal persons in the socio-economic context. METHODS: A self- and mutual- exciting process model was fitted to the data, adjusting for divorce rate, unemployment rate, and property price index. Breaking the whole period into onset, peak, and post-peak stages, the model was fitted again to examine the differences. RESULTS: Comparable copycat effects were found on both CB and non-CB suicide news. The only cross-method media effects were found in the onset stage when non-CB suicide news showed suppressing effect on CB suicides. CB suicides reported a significant self-excitation effect. A higher divorce rate and lower property price index were associated with significantly more suicides incidences and more suicide news. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging of CB suicide method did not substitute media coverage of non-CB suicide in HK. Media effects in this case were not limited to new suicide method or celebrity suicide. The effects were further fueled by adverse socio-economic conditions.","Cheng, Qijin; Chen, Feng; Yip, Paul S.

Methods We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: age 75 years or more, age between 60 and 74 years, and presence of at least one comorbidity, or need for supplemental oxygen (3 L/min or more). Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or tracheal intubation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10. Results The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years and 151 patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in nine patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and eight patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45-2.80; P=0.82). No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the secondary endpoints.

This study assessed the influence of polymorphisms in these candidate genes towards endurance test performance in 46 players from a single Australian Football League (AFL) team. Each player provided saliva buccal swab samples for DNA analysis and genotyping and were required to perform two independent two-kilometre running time-trials, six weeks apart. Linear mixed models were created to account for repeated measures over time and to determine whether player genotypes are associated with overall performance in the two-kilometre time-trial. The results showed that the ADRB1 Arg389Gly CC (p = 0.034) and PPARGC1A Gly482Ser GG (p = 0.031) genotypes were significantly associated with a faster two-kilometre time-trial.

Previous studies have shown that the intervention results in an increase in knowledge and communication on kidney replacement therapy, and eventually in an increase in the number of living donor kidney transplantations. The study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to standard care. METHODS: A dynamic probabilistic Markov model was used to estimate the monetary and health benefits of the intervention in The Netherlands over 10 years. Data on costs and health-related quality of life were derived from the literature. Transition probabilities, prevalence, and incidence rates were calculated using a large national database. An optimistic and a pessimistic implementation scenario were compared to a base case scenario with standard care. RESULTS: In both the optimistic and pessimistic scenario, the intervention is cost-effective and dominant compared to standard care: savings were €108,681,985 and €51,770,060 and the benefits were 1382 and 695 QALYs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The superior cost-effectiveness of the intervention is caused by the superior health effects and the reduction of costs associated with transplantation, and the relatively small incremental costs of the intervention. The favorable findings of this implementation project resulted in national uptake of the intervention in The Netherlands as of 2021. This is the first time a psychosocial intervention has been implemented as part of standard care in a kidney replacement therapy program worldwide.","Redeker, Steef; Ismail, Sohal; Eeren, Hester V.; Massey, Emma K.; Weimar, Willem; Oppe, Mark; Busschbach, Jan",Eur J Health Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-021-01383-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647158/,67

TNF‐α (500 U/ml) induced apoptosis of OLN cells, which wasconfirmed by DNA fragmentation using an in situ end‐labeling technique andultrastructural analysis. Flupirtine significantly reduced the rate ofspontaneous cell death of OLN cells already at low concentrations;TNF‐α‐mediated apoptosis was suppressed only with higher concentrationsof flupirtine (100 μM). Expression of Bcl‐2 protein and mRNA inOLN cells was detected by immunocytochemistry, western blot, and RT‐PCR.Quantitative analysis of western blots revealed an ∼2.5‐fold up‐regulationof Bcl‐2 protein during TNF‐α treatment. Furthermore, addition of 10 or100 μM flupirtine before incubation with TNF‐α led to anapproximately threefold increase of Bcl‐2 expression. Exposure of OLN cells toflupirtine alone moderately augmented the expression of Bcl‐2 protein. Ourdata demonstrate that flupirtine up‐regulates the expression of Bcl‐2 proteinin OLN cells; this Bcl‐2 induction is associated with a reduced rate ofTNF‐α‐induced cell death.","Burgmaier, Gruscha; Schönrock, Lisa M.; Kuhlmann, Tanja; Richter‐Landsberg, Christiane; Brück, Wolfgang",J Neurochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11080178/,67

Methods Baseline survey was conducted from February 10, 2020 to February 25, 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital on the discharge day. After discharge, patients were free to choose whether isolate in a centralized isolation site (i.e. designated hotel) or their own home for another two weeks. A follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the 2-week post-discharge isolation. Depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health were assessed at both time points using the 9-item patient health questionnaire, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale and self-rated health scores, respectively. Results Fifty centrally isolated and 45 home isolated patients completed both the baseline and the follow-up assessments. Significant effects of time and time by isolation form were found on depression and anxiety levels, with a significant decrease in depression and anxiety shown in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Besides, a significant time effect was identified on self-rated health with significant improvement found in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Conclusions Home isolation is superior to centralized isolation in the recovery of COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health. More attention needs to be paid to the psychological well-being of centrally isolated patients. A sustained and integrated rehabilitation plan is warranted for patients with COVID-19 to achieve both physical and psychological recovery.","Ju, Yumeng; Chen, Wentao; Liu, Jin; Yang, Aiping; Shu, Kongliang; Zhou, Yun; Wang, Mi; Huang, Mei; Liao, Mei; Liu, Jiyang; Liu, Bangshan; Zhang, Yan",J Psychosom Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581399/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399921000106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399921000106?v=s5,67

646510,Discussion on selecting the number of breaks in the pattern of spread of COVID-19 (a reply to Zhao and Liang),2020-08-28,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 is still showing a tendency of spreading around the world. In order to improve the subsequent control of COVID-19, it is essential to conduct a study on measuring and predicting the scale of the outbreak in the future. METHODS: This paper uses rolling mechanism and grid search to find the best fractional order of Fractional Order Accumulation Grey Model (FGM). Buffer level is proposed based on the general form of weakening buffer operator to measure the effect of government control measurements on the epidemic. And the buffer level is associated with the Government Response Stringency index and the Mobility Index. RESULTS: Firstly, the model proposed in this paper dominates the ARIMA model which has been widely used in predicting the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Secondly, in the process of using the buffer level to modify the FGM, this paper finds that government measurements require the active cooperation of the public and often have a time lag when they are effective. Only when government increase its stringency and the public observe the order can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down. If there is only the controlling measure and the public does not react actively, it will not slow down the epidemic. Thirdly, according to the Mobility Index and Government Response Stringency Index in December, this paper predicts the cumulative confirmed cases of the end of January in different scenarios according to different buffer levels. The study suggests that the world should continue to maintain high vigilance and take corresponding control measures for the outbreak of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Government’s control measures and public’s abidance are both important in this battle with COVID-19. Governments control measures have time-lag effect and the time lag is about 9 days. When the government increases its stringency and the public cooperates with the government, we must consider the weaken buffer operator with proper buffer level in the prediction process. These prediction methods can be considered in the prediction of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the future or the trend of other epidemics.","Lo, Kai Lisa; Zhang, Minglei; Chen, Yanhui; Mi, Jinhong Jackson",J Healthc Inform Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514291/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41666-021-00103-w,67

STUDY DESIGN: Patients hospitalized between 3 months and 16 years of age were included in a 1‐year prospective, observational, cross‐sectional study. Respiratory secretions were collected and the presence of different viruses and atypical bacteria analyzed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Two hundred nine patients (118 females) aged (mean ± SD) 4.4 ± 4 years were included. A potential causative agent was detected in 78% of the patients. The most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (n = 85; 40%) and rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 52; 24.5%); M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 4.5% and 2% of the cases, respectively. Patients with HRSV (vs. HRV) were hospitalized for a longer time (6.7 vs. 5.2 days, P = 0.012), required more days of oxygen supply (5.1 vs. 3.4, P = 0.005), had a longer duration of the exacerbation before hospitalization (3.6 vs. 1.9 days, P = 0.001) and were younger (3.7 vs. 5.1 years, P = 0.012). Three peaks of admissions were observed. A first peak (early autumn) caused by HRV, a second peak (winter) caused mainly by HRSV and a third one (spring), caused by HRSV, an increase in HMPV together with a second outbreak of HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an acute asthma exacerbation presented a high prevalence of respiratory viruses. Most hospitalizations corresponded to seasonal increases in prevalence of HRV and HRSV.

We assessed how depressive symptoms changed among U.S. adults over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified the key risk factors for these symptoms. METHODS: Longitudinal panel study of a nationally representative group of U.S. adults ages 18 years and older surveyed in March-April 2020 (Time 1; N=1441) and March-April 2021 (Time 2; N=1161) in the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (CLIMB). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to define elevated depressive symptoms (cut-off ≥10) and depressive symptoms score (0-27). FINDINGS: The prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms persisted from 27.8% in 2020 (95% CI: 24.9, 30.9) to 32.8% in 2021 (95% CI: 29.1, 36.8). Over time, the central drivers of depressive symptoms were low household income, not being married, and experiencing multiple stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The odds ratio of elevated depressive symptoms for low income relative to high income persons increased from 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.2) in 2020 to 7.0 (95% CI: 3.7, 13.3) in 2021. Fewer people reported experiencing 4 or more COVID-19 stressors in 2021 than in 2020 (47.5% in 2020 vs 37.1% in 2021), but the odds ratio of elevated depressive symptoms associated with 4 or more stressors relative to 1 stressor or less increased from 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.1) in 2020 to 5.4 (95% CI: 3.2, 9.2) in 2021. INTERPRETATION: The burden of depressive symptoms in the U.S. adult population increased over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

648079,"Spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 and government response in South Korea (as of May 31, 2020)",2020-07-04,"A personalized mechanical ventilation approach for patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on lung physiology and morphology, ARDS etiology, lung imaging, and biological phenotypes may improve ventilation practice and outcome. However, additional research is warranted before personalized mechanical ventilation strategies can be applied at the bedside. Ventilatory parameters should be titrated based on close monitoring of targeted physiologic variables and individualized goals. Although low tidal volume (V(T)) is a standard of care, further individualization of V(T) may necessitate the evaluation of lung volume reserve (e.g., inspiratory capacity). Low driving pressures provide a target for clinicians to adjust V(T) and possibly to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), while maintaining plateau pressures below safety thresholds. Esophageal pressure monitoring allows estimation of transpulmonary pressure, but its use requires technical skill and correct physiologic interpretation for clinical application at the bedside. Mechanical power considers ventilatory parameters as a whole in the optimization of ventilation setting, but further studies are necessary to assess its clinical relevance. The identification of recruitability in patients with ARDS is essential to titrate and individualize PEEP. To define gas-exchange targets for individual patients, clinicians should consider issues related to oxygen transport and dead space. In this review, we discuss the rationale for personalized approaches to mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS, the role of lung imaging, phenotype identification, physiologically based individualized approaches to ventilation, and a future research agenda.

649287,Risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from hospital admission during the pandemic,2020-10-08,"Since March 2020, the world has been fighting a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, an airway disease that can be severe and fatal in a percentage of cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop extrapulmonary lesions, with renal, hepatic, cardiac, neurological, and tissue involvement that can cause further severe complications. On December 21, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the marketing of the first COVID-19 vaccine. However, several randomized trials are ongoing to find effective, safe, and widely available treatments. The most severe stages of COVID-19 infection are characterized by a multi-system inflammatory state induced by a cytokine storm causing multi-organ injury. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that glucocorticoids (GCs), particularly dexamethasone, are used in severe, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with good therapeutic benefit. COVID-19 can also damage the endothelial system, causing microcirculatory disturbances and consequently leading to functional organ disorders. The combination of endothelial dysfunction with a generalized inflammatory state may contribute to the general pro-coagulative state described in patients with COVID-19 with increased risk of venous and arterial occlusions. The aim of this article is to describe the therapeutic utility of GCs in stabilizing the vascular endothelial barrier in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, we believe that the stabilization of the endothelial barrier and the anti-inflammatory effect of GCs could be the main effect underlying the therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients.","Ferrara, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443616/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-021-02049-7,67

METHODS: The present statement summarizes the key challenges concerning the management of haemoglobinopathies, with particular focus on patients with either transfusion‐dependent or non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, identifies the gaps in knowledge and suggests measures and strategies to deal with the pandemic, based on available evidence and expert opinions. Key areas covered include patients’ risk level, adaptation of haemoglobinopathy care, safety of blood transfusions, blood supply challenges, and lifestyle and nutritional considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed measures and strategies may be useful as a blueprint for other disorders which require regular hospital visits, as well as for the timely adaptation of patient care during similar future pandemics.","Farmakis, Dimitrios; Giakoumis, Anastasios; Cannon, Lily; Angastiniotis, Michael; Eleftheriou, Androulla",Eur J Haematol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573838/,67
649689,Remdesivir Treatment for Severe COVID-19 in Third-Trimester Pregnancy: Case Report and Management Discussion,2020-08-24,"Lonicerae japonicae flos (LJF) is widely used for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To clarify the anti-inflammatory mechanism of LJF, 29 compounds with high content in LJF were selected for network pharmacology. Then, a comprehensive network pharmacology strategy was implemented, which involved compound-inflammation-target construction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and enrichment analysis. Finally, molecular docking and in vitro experiments were performed to verify the anti-inflammatory activity and targets of the key compound. As a result, 279 inflammation-associated proteins were identified, which are mainly involved in the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. A total of 12 compounds were linked to more than 35 targets, including apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, and ferulic acid. The results of molecular docking showed that AKT has the most binding activity, exhibiting certain binding activity with 10 compounds, including vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, secologanic acid, quercetin, and luteolin; the results of qRT-PCR and WB confirmed that two key compounds, secologanic acid and luteolin, could significantly decrease the secretion of TNF-α and the AKT expression of RAW264.7 murine macrophages stimulated by LPS (lipopolysaccharide). These results demonstrate that the comprehensive strategy can serve as a universal method to illustrate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine by identifying the pathways or targets.","Guo, Xiaoying; Yu, Xiao; Zheng, Bingqing; Zhang, Longfei; Zhang, Fang; Zhang, Yongqing; Li, Jia; Pu, Gaobin; Zhang, Lijun; Wu, Haifeng",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5507003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595237/,67
651011,Contact tracing for COVID-19: An opportunity to reduce health disparities and End the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in the US,2020-04-27,"This article examines the impact of partial/full reopening of school/college campuses on the spread of a pandemic using COVID-19 as a case study. The study uses an agent-based simulation model that replicates community spread in an urban region of U.S.A. via daily social mixing of susceptible and infected individuals. Data representing population demographics, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and social interventions guides the model's behavior, which is calibrated and validated using data reported by the government. The model indicates a modest but significant increase (8.15%) in the total number of reported cases in the region for a complete (100%) reopening compared to keeping schools and colleges fully virtual. For partial returns of 75% and 50%, the percent increases in the number of reported cases are shown to be small (2.87% and 1.26%, respectively) and statistically insignificant. The AB model also predicts that relaxing the stringency of the school safety protocol for sanitizing, use of mask, social distancing, testing, and quarantining and thus allowing the school transmission coefficient to double may result in a small increase in the number of reported infected cases (2.14%). Hence for pandemic outbreaks from viruses with similar characteristics as for SARS-CoV-2, keeping the schools and colleges open with a modest campus safety protocol and in-person attendance below a certain threshold may be advisable.","Tatapudi, Hanisha; Das, Tapas K.",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258483/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000464?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000464,67

Through analytical and numerical analysis, a novel framework is developed that exploits information in these signatures. An approach well known to physics is applied, where one looks for common dynamical features, independently from differences in other factors. These features and associated scaling laws are used as a powerful tool to pinpoint regions where analytical derivations are effective, get an insight into qualitative changes of the disease progression, and infer the key infection parameters. The developed framework for joint analytical and numerical analysis of empirically observed COVID‐19 growth patterns can lead to a fundamental understanding of infection progression under strong control measures, applicable to outbursts of both COVID‐19 and other infectious diseases.","Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko; Ilic, Bojana; Stojku, Stefan; Salom, Igor",Glob Chall,https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202000101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786198/,67

METHODS: This research combined two kinds of methods: a questionnaire survey and the in-depth interview to two CEOs of the sample hospitals. One hospital is not-for-profit, while the other is a public hospital and the research samples are from the hospital data from Taiwan's 2005 to 2007 Department of Health qualifying lists of hospital accreditation. The returned questionnaires were analyzed with STATISTICA(® )7.1 version software. RESULTS: The results for non-medical items showed medical waste and common trash both have the highest rate (94.6 percent) of being outsourced. The gift store (75 percent) and linen (73 percent) follow close behind, while the lowest rate of outsourcing is in utility maintenance (13.5 percent). For medical items, the highest rate of outsourcing is in the ambulance units (51.4 percent), while the hemodialysis center follows close behind with a rate of 50 percent. For departments of nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing however, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3 percent. This shows that Taiwan's hospitals are still conservative in their willingness to outsource for medical items. The results of the satisfaction paired t-test show that the non-medical items have a higher score than the medical items. The factor analysis showed the three significant factors in of non medical items' outsourcing are ""performance"", ""finance"", and ""human resource"". For medical items, the two factors are ""operation"" and satisfaction"". To further exam the factor validity and reliability of the satisfaction model, a confirmative factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using structure equation modeling (SEM) method and found the model fitting well. CONCLUSION: Hospitals, especially for public hospitals, can get benefits from outsourcing to revive the full-time-equivalent and human resource limitation.","Hsiao, Chih-Tung; Pai, Jar-Yuan; Chiu, Hero",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19435526/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-78,67

All cases responded well to pulsed-dose corticosteroids. However, in conventional practice, corticosteroids can complicate adverse events, including opportunistic infections, diabetes, and osteoporosis. One of the cases reported here involved dermatomyositis-associated ILD with anti-EJ antibodies. Considering possible side effects of corticosteroids and the frequent recurrence of ILDs associated with anti-EJ antibodies, we decided to use nintedanib as a sequential treatment for acute exacerbation of ILDs. Nintedanib has just been approved for treatment of progressive fibrosing ILD, but to date, few reports of acute exacerbation of ILDs treated with nintedanib have been published. This case series may contribute to a more thorough discussion regarding the use and timing of nintedanib in treating acute exacerbation of ILDs.","Nakashima, Kazuki; Yanagihara, Toyoshi; Ishida, Sae; Ogo, Naruhiko; Egashira, Ayaka; Asoh, Tatsuma; Maeyama, Takashige",Respir Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763326/,67

We assessed the feasibility and impact of telehealth visits on the time-in-range (TIR) of paediatric individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: An observational multicentre real-life study. Patients scheduled for an in-clinic visit during the lockdown were offered to participate in a telehealth visit. Sociodemographic, clinical, continuous glucose monitor and pump data were recorded 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after telehealth visit. The primary endpoint was change in relative-TIR, i.e. change in TIR divided by the percent of possible change (∆TIR/(100-TIRbefore)*100). RESULTS: The study group comprised 195 individuals with T1D (47.7% males), mean±SD age 14.6 ± 5.3 years, and diabetes duration 6.0 ± 4.6 years. Telehealth was accomplished with 121 patients and their parents (62.0%); 74 (38.0%) did not transfer complete data. Mean TIR was significantly higher for the two-week period after the telehealth visit than for the two-week period prior the visit (62.9 ± 16.0, p < 0.001 vs. 59.0 ± 17.2); the improvement in relative-TIR was 5.7±26.1%. Initial higher mean glucose level, lower TIR, less time spent at <54 mg/dl range, longer time spent at 180–250 mg/dl range, higher daily insulin dose, and single-parent household were associated with improved relative-TIR. Multiple regression logistic analysis demonstrated only initial lower TIR and single-parent household were significant, odds ratio: −0.506, (95%CI −0.99,−0.023), p=0.04 and 13.82, (95%CI 0.621, 27.016), p=0.04, respectively.

With success in interventions aimed at depleting amyloid-β peptides being limited at best, a greater understanding of the physiological role of amyloid-β peptides is needed. The development of amyloid-β plaques has been determined to occur 10–20 years prior to AD symptom manifestation, hence earlier interventions might be necessary to address presymptomatic AD. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that amyloid-β peptides may play a role in innate immunity as an antimicrobial peptide. These findings, coupled with the evidence of pathogens such as viruses and bacteria in AD brains, suggests that the buildup of amyloid-β plaques could be a response to the presence of viruses and bacteria. This has led to the foundation of the antimicrobial hypothesis for AD. The present review will highlight the current understanding of amyloid-β, and the role of bacteria and viruses in AD, and will also explore the therapeutic potential of antimicrobial and antiviral drugs in Alzheimer’s disease.","Iqbal, Umar H.; Zeng, Emma; Pasinetti, Giulio M.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21144920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32664669/,67

657105,Spotlight on Jails: COVID-19 Mitigation Policies Needed Now,2020-03-28,"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread in early 2020, causing tens of thousands of deaths, over a million cases and widespread socioeconomic disruption. With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited, and explored a range of supply and demand dynamics. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.","Worby, Colin J.; Chang, Hsiao-Han",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511626/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20052696,67

Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS coronavirus (SCV) in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. Observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection–induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10–40 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity.

Sequence analysis revealed that one of these strains contained distinct insertion and deletions in the S gene (i.e., S INDEL). Furthermore, inoculation of PEDV into 1-week-old pigs demonstrated that the S INDEL strain had a lower pathogenicity than the North American (NA) prototype strain. This is the first report comparing pathogenicity of an S INDEL strain with the NA prototype strain following experimental inoculation. Excretion of PEDV in the feces of S INDEL strain-inoculated pigs occurred later than in NA prototype strain-inoculated pigs.

Experience with the first project allowed for rapid implementation of the second project during a 3-day period. In both instances, the surveillance efforts were undertaken without the need for extraordinary ED or public health staffing requirements. CONCLUSION: A regional emergency medicine Internet approach permitted rapid implementation of multisite syndromic surveillance without additional staff. Some problems were identified with the first project, related to clinician checklist completion and manual data tabulation and entry. The SARS project addressed these by simplifying data collection and restricting it to triage.","Foldy, Seth; Biedrzycki, Paul A.; Barthell, Edward N.; Healy-Haney, Nancy; Baker, Bevan K.; Howe, Donna S.; Gieryn, Douglas; Pemble, Kim R.",Ann Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15332066/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064404000708; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064404000708,67

When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes.

665231,The Value of Medical Registries and Observational Studies Early in Pandemics: The COVID-19 Experience,2021-07-16,"INTRODUCTION: Mainstreamed genetic testing (MGT) obviates the need for a cancer genetics consultation, since trained oncologists (O) and gynaecologists (G) provide counseling, prescribe testing and deliver results. We report results from our MGT program and emphasize its utility during the COVID-19 lockdown, when cancer genetics clinics had suspended their activity. METHODS: An MGT pathway for breast and ovarian cancer (BC/OC) patients was established in Jan-2018 between the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris.Sorbonne Université Cancer Genetics team and the Oncology/Gynecology departments at one teaching and two regional hospitals. Trained O + G evaluated patients with the Manchester Scoring System. A 12-point threshold was recommended for testing. Next-generation sequencing of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C and RAD51D was performed. Results were delivered to the patient by O/G. Pathogenic variants (PV) carriers were referred to the genetics clinic. Results are reported for the 2nd-Jan-2018 to 1st-June-2020 period. That includes the eight-week COVID-19 lockdown and three-week de-confinement phase 1. RESULTS: Results were available for 231/234 patients. Twenty-eight (12.1%) carried a PV. Of the 27 patients tested during the COVID-19 period, three carried a PV, two in BRCA1 and one in RAD51C. The clinical impact was immediate for the two BRCA1 BC cases undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, since double mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy will now be performed using two-step strategies. CONCLUSIONS: MGT guaranteed care continuity in BC/OC patients during the critical phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, with immediate implications for PV carriers. More broadly, we report for the first time the successful implementation of MGT in France.","Benusiglio, Patrick R.; Korenbaum, Clément; Vibert, Roseline; Ezenfis, Joël; Geoffron, Sophie; Paul, Charlotte; Richard, Sandrine; Byrde, Veronique; Lejeune, Manon; Guillerm, Erell; Basset, Noemie; Lotz, Jean-Pierre; Chabbert-Buffet, Nathalie; Gligorov, Joseph; Coulet, Florence",Eur J Med Genet,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmg.2020.104098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186762/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721220308089?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1769721220308089,67

Early excision of the polyps by surgery is an effective treatment resulting in a permanent cure. We present a case of successful management of severe obstruction of the oropharynx in a newborn who presented with a large mass of congenital hairy polyp. CASE REPORT A vaginally delivered infant, weighing 3 kg, presented immediately after birth with cyanosis symptoms, failure of the first cry, and respiratory distress signs. The newborn was born to a mother with an uneventful pregnancy. Screening tests during the pregnancy reported no congenital anomalies. The newborn's hematological and biochemical test results were normal. After presenting these symptoms, the newborn was immediately intubated and put on a nasogastric feeding tube, which revealed a small portion of a polyp-like mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan further confirmed a large pedunculated mass, measuring 3×2 cm, arising from the soft palate, and obstructing the oropharynx. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a hairy polyp. The polyp was wholly removed transorally using the Covidien LigaSure device without the need for endoscopy. This procedure allowed safe extubation, and the baby was discharged home without symptoms 4 days after birth. CONCLUSIONS This case sheds light on the importance of considering hairy polyp in the differential diagnosis of pharyngeal mass with respiratory distress in pediatric patients. This report also describes our experience using the LigaSure surgical device without needing endoscopic visualization to successfully resect the hairy polyp without complications.","Khasawneh, Laith; Neri, Giampiero; Al-Mistarehi, Abdel-Hameed; Khassawneh, Adi H; Al-Omar, Khaled; Filograna Pignatelli, Giulio Romano; Tarifi, Amjed Adnan; Al Katatbeh, Mohammad A; Alzoubi, Firas",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762553/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.930200,67

This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25–8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80–0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77–0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94–1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68–1.10; p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma. The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID-19 and have similar clinical outcomes.","Sunjaya, Anthony P.; Allida, Sabine M.; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Jenkins, Christine",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1888116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556287/,67

However, it has recently been suggested that they may cause more severe respiratory disease. Immunofluorescence (IF) assays are rapid and inexpensive and are often used for the detection of respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop an IF procedure, using commercially available reagents, for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses directly from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). STUDY DESIGN: From 1st November 2006 until 31st October 2007 all NPA from patients with respiratory infection were stained with the Light Diagnostic Pan-Enterovirus Reagent – “Blend” by IF (IF-ENVPAN). Those specimens which tested positive with this stain were further tested (subject to the availability of frozen specimen) with the xTAG respiratory viral panel, a multiplex PCR directed against respiratory picornaviruses, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory sincytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IFA and IFB), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1–4, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronaviruses. RESULTS: 241/1122 NPA tested positive by IF-ENVPAN. 143 NPA were available for testing by xTAG respiratory viral panel. The multiplex PCR detected respiratory picornaviruses in 139 NPA, in 126 as the sole viral pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential of IF-ENVPAN for the laboratory detection of respiratory picornaviruses in clinical specimens.

Hospitalized or critically ill patients are at higher risk of malnutrition, and rapid assessment and treatment of poor nutritional status can impact clinical outcomes. As it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 5% of these patients require admission to an ICU. Per clinical practice guidelines, nutrition therapy should be a core component of treatment regimens. On account of the urgent need for information relating to the nutritional support of these patients, clinical practice guidance was published based on current critical care guidelines. However, a growing body of literature is now available that may provide further direction for the nutritional status and support in COVID-19 patients. This review, intended for the health care community, provides a heretofore lacking in-depth discussion and summary of the current data on nutrition risk and assessment and clinical practice guidelines for medical nutrition therapy for hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Thomas, Sara; Alexander, Celeste; Cassady, Bridget A.",Clin Nutr ESPEN,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405457721002102; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330494/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457721002102?v=s5,67

The burden of lockdown has been particularly heavy on patients with chronic neurologic diseases such as People with Epilepsy (PwE). Our survey aims to describe the struggles and needs of Drug-Resistant (DR) PwE with implanted Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown in order to find strategies that help patients cope with present or future periods of restriction. Methods: We collected answers from 30 respondents who underwent an online survey including socio-demographic and clinical information and COVID-19-related information. Depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality were investigated in patients through BDI II, GAD-7, and the PSQI scale. Results: In all, 46% of our sample reported an increase in the number of seizures; the entire sample complained of epilepsy-related issues (medication availability, VSN adjustments, anxiety, sleep disturbance); one out of three participants reported major epilepsy issues felt urgent; 30% had to postpone scheduled examination. Significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety scales were found in patients who perceived seizure frequency worsening and reported major epilepsy-related issues. Conclusion: Preliminary findings showed that the first lockdown influenced the clinical and psychological status of PwE and was related to seizures worsening. The lack of medical assistance and control on VNS therapy left patients to cope with the situation without a chance to contact a specialist. We discuss how a wider implementation of telemedicine programs could facilitate remote assistance of PwE with a VNS implant.","Grande, Eleonora; Tufo, Tommaso; Ciavarro, Marco; Di Muccio, Ines; Fuggetta, Filomena; Silvestri, Martina; Bevacqua, Giuseppina; Lanzone, Jacopo; Assenza, Giovanni",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716943/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.640581,67

Detailed histopathological descriptions of COVID‐19 chilblains have not been reported, and causality of SARS‐CoV‐2 has not been established yet. OBJECTIVE: To describe histopathological features of Covid‐19 chilblains and explore the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the tissue. METHODS: We examined skin biopsies from 7 paediatric patients presenting with chilblains during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Immunohistochemistry for SARS‐CoV‐2 was performed in all cases and electron microscopy in one. RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endothelialitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS‐CoV‐2 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage, support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS‐CoV‐2. Endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 chilblains and perhaps also in a group of patients severely affected by COVID‐19 presenting with features of microangiopathic damage.","Colmenero, I.; Santonja, C.; Alonso‐Riaño, M.; Noguera‐Morel, L.; Hernández‐Martín, A.; Andina, D.; Wiesner, T.; Rodríguez‐Peralto, J.L.; Requena, L.; Torrelo, A.",Br J Dermatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32562567/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19327,67

Simultaneously, there has been a convergence of scientific disciplines such as synthetic biology, data science, advanced computing and many other technologies, which all have applications in health. For example, advances in cybercrime methods have created ransomware attacks on hospitals, which can cripple health systems and threaten human life. New kinds of biological weapons which fall outside of traditional Cold War era thinking can be created synthetically using genetic code. These convergent trajectories are dramatically expanding the repertoire of methods which can be used for benefit or harm. We describe a new risk landscape for which there are few precedents, and where regulation and mitigation are a challenge. Rapidly evolving patterns of technology convergence and proliferation of dual-use risks expose inadequate societal preparedness. We outline examples in the areas of biological weapons, antimicrobial resistance, laboratory security and cybersecurity in health care. New challenges in health security such as precision harm in medicine can no longer be addressed within the isolated vertical silo of health, but require cross-disciplinary solutions from other fields. Nor can they cannot be managed effectively by individual countries.

Progressively larger, independent cohorts of Covid-19 positive sera were tested in the refinement processes, leading to the identification of immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) protein and Orf1ab polyprotein. A summary study testing 50 serum samples highlighted an epitope of the N protein (region 155–71) providing good diagnostic performance in discriminating Covid-19 positive vs. healthy individuals. Using this epitope, 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity were reached for IgG detection in Covid-19 samples, and no cross-reactivity with common cold coronaviruses was detected. Likewise, IgM immunoreactivity in samples collected within the first month after symptoms onset showed discrimination ability.

They have become a latent threat, particularly in indoor environment. Photocatalysis is a promising process to inactivate completely bioaerosols from air. However, in systems treating a continuous air flow, catalysts can be partially lost in the gaseous effluent. To avoid such phenomenon, supporting materials can be used to fix catalysts. In the present work, four photocatalytic systems using Perlite or Poraver glass beads impregnated with ZnO or TiO(2) were tested. The inactivation mechanism of bioaerosols and the cytotoxic effect of the catalysts to bioaerosols were studied. The plug flow photocatalytic reactor treated a bioaerosol flow of 460 × 1 0(6) cells/m(3)(air) with a residence time of 5.7 s. Flow Cytometry (FC) was used to quantify and characterize bioaerosols in terms of dead, injured and live cells. The most efficient system was ZnO/Perlite with 72% inactivation of bioaerosols, maintaining such inactivation during 7.5 h due to the higher water retention capacity of Perlite (2.8 mL/g(Perlite)) in comparison with Poraver (1.5 mL/g(Perlite)). However, a global balance showed that TiO(2)/Poraver system triggered the highest level of cytotoxicity to bioaerosols retained on the support after 96 h with 95% of dead cells. SEM and FC analyses showed that the mechanism of inactivation with ZnO was based on membrane damage, morphological cell changes and cell lysis; whereas only membrane damage and cell lysis were involved with TiO(2). Overall, results highlighted that photocatalytic technologies can completely inactivate bioaerosols in indoor environments.

There are no standard guidelines for the prevention and control of HPIV3 in the outpatient setting. After 2 HSCT inpatients diagnosed with HPIV3 were noted to have had multiple recent HSCT outpatient clinic (OPC) visits, an investigation of policy and procedures in the HSCT OPC was undertaken, and active surveillance for respiratory viral illness was instituted in the at-risk HSCT population. Between July 19 and August 30, 2005, 13 patients were diagnosed with HPIV3 infection. Morbidity in affected patients was significant, and mortality was high (38.5%) and not affected by antiviral therapy. Molecular typing identified several genetically distinct groups of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene of the 11 available isolates. Based on sequence relatedness among the isolates and the demographic and exposure history of the patients, in many of these cases HPIV3 infection likely was acquired in the HSCT OPC. The major infection control interventions were introduced between August 20 and August 24. An epidemic curve revealed that HPIV3 infection frequency peaked between August 17 and August 26, with no cases identified after August 30. Prompt attention and focus on infection control interventions were associated with a rapid decrease in the number of incident cases. Policies and procedures regarding patients with respiratory viral illnesses in HSCT OPC populations should be formulated and universally reinforced with HSCT clinic staff to prevent the spread of these infections.","Maziarz, Richard T.; Sridharan, Praseeda; Slater, Susan; Meyers, Gabrielle; Post, Mary; Erdman, Dean D.; Peret, Teresa C.-T.; Taplitz, Randy A.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879109004327; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879109004327; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19781656/,67
678989,How useful is serology for COVID-19?,2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated racial and ethnic disparities in patterns of COVID-19 testing (i.e., who received testing and who tested positive) and subsequent mortality in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective cohort study included 5,834,543 individuals receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs; most (91%) were men, 74% were non-Hispanic White (White), 19% were non-Hispanic Black (Black), and 7% were Hispanic. We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of COVID-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, with multivariable adjustment for a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics including comorbid conditions, health behaviors, medication history, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Between February 8 and July 22, 2020, 254,595 individuals were tested for COVID-19, of whom 16,317 tested positive and 1,057 died. Black individuals were more likely to be tested (rate per 1,000 individuals: 60.0, 95% CI 59.6–60.5) than Hispanic (52.7, 95% CI 52.1–53.4) and White individuals (38.6, 95% CI 38.4–38.7). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (Black versus White: odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.85–2.01, p < 0.001; Hispanic versus White: OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.74–1.94, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (Black versus White: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.17, p = 0.74; Hispanic versus White: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73–1.34, p = 0.94). The disparity between Black and White individuals in testing positive for COVID-19 was stronger in the Midwest (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.41–2.95, p < 0.001) than the West (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.39, p < 0.001). The disparity in testing positive for COVID-19 between Hispanic and White individuals was consistent across region, calendar time, and outbreak pattern. Study limitations include underrepresentation of women and a lack of detailed information on social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, we found that Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. There is an urgent need to proactively tailor strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in racial and ethnic minority communities.","Rentsch, Christopher T.; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Tate, Janet P.; Park, Lesley S.; King, Joseph T.; Skanderson, Melissa; Hauser, Ronald G.; Schultze, Anna; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Holodniy, Mark; Lo Re, Vincent; Akgün, Kathleen M.; Crothers, Kristina; Taddei, Tamar H.; Freiberg, Matthew S.; Justice, Amy C.",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960880/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003379,67
679605,The Effect of Probiotics on Respiratory Tract Infection with Special Emphasis on COVID-19: A Periodic Review during 2010-2020,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND: Critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a high fatality rate, especially in hemodialysis (HD) patients, with this poor prognosis being caused by systemic hyperinflammation; cytokine storms. Steroid pulse therapy or tocilizumab (TCZ) have insufficient inhibitory effects against cytokine storms in critical cases. This study evaluated the clinical effects and safety of combining steroid pulse therapy and TCZ. METHODS: From September 2020 to May 2021, 201 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital. Before February 2021, patients with an oxygen demand exceeding 8 L/min were intubated and treated with standard therapy (dexamethasone and antiviral therapy). After February 2021, patients underwent high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and were treated with TCZ (8 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone (mPSL) (500 mg/day [≤ 75 kg], 1000 mg/day [> 75 kg]) for 3 days. We compared background characteristics, laboratory findings, and prognosis between non-HD and HD patients and between patients who received and did not receive TCZ and mPSL pulse therapy. RESULTS: Among non-HD patients, the TCZ + mPSL pulse group had significantly higher survival rates and lower secondary infection rates (p < 0.05), than the standard therapy group. All HD patients in the standard therapy group with oxygen demand exceeding 8 L/min died. Contrastingly, all patients in the TCZ + mPSL pulse group survived, with their oxygen demand decreasing to 0–1 L/min within 3 weeks post-administration. CONCLUSION: TCZ combined with mPSL pulse therapy improved the survival rate without significant adverse events in critical HD and non-HD patients with COVID-19 by strongly suppressing systemic hyperinflammation.","Toda, Masataro; Fujii, Kentaro; Yoshifuji, Ayumi; Kondo, Yasushi; Itoh, Kazuto; Sekine, Kazuhiko; Kikuchi, Takahide; Ryuzaki, Munekazu",Clin Exp Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-021-02126-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436742/,67

Unfortunately, these studies fell short to address disparities in health status and resources among decentralized communities in the United States. In this study, we utilized an advanced modeling technique to examine complex associations of county-level health factors with COVID-19 mortality for all 3141 counties in the United States. Our results indicated that counties with more uninsured people, more housing problems, more urbanized areas, and longer commute are more likely to have higher COVID-19 mortality. Based on the nationwide population-based data, this study also echoed prior research that used local data, and confirmed that county-level sociodemographic factors, such as more Black, Hispanic, and older subpopulations, are attributed to high risk of COVID-19 mortality. We hope that these findings will help set up priorities on high risk communities and subpopulations in future for fighting the novel virus.","Pan, Wei; Miyazaki, Yasuo; Tsumura, Hideyo; Miyazaki, Emi; Yang, Wei",J Biomed Res,https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.34.20200129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109778/,67

Acoustic micrographs obtained at 420 MHz clearly resolve the weld lines with morphological deformations and microelastic heterogenity. This is also where terahertz (THz) measurements, carried out in support of the SAM study, reveal enhanced birefringence corresponding to the location of these lines enabling verification of the SAM results. Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (RSAW), quantified by V(z) curves (with defocusing distance of 85 µm), are found to propagate slower in regions close to the weld lines than in regions distant from these lines. The discrepancy of about 100 m/s in the velocity of RSAW indicates a large variation in the micro-elastic properties between areas close to and distant from the weld lines. The spatial variations in velocity (VR ) of RSAWs indicate anisotropic propagation of the differently polarized ultrasonic waves.","Mohamed, Esam T.

Several cases of viral induced demyelinatimg encephalomyelitis in human beings and in experimental models as well as the presence of IgG oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate that the infectious factor may be viral. However, the absence of a specific virus identification in MS central nervous system may hardly support this notion. On the other hand, the partial response of patients with MS to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy support the evidence of an autoimmune etiology for MS. However, the autoimmune hypothesis shares the same criticism with the infectious one in that no autoantigen(s) specific to and causative for MS has ever been identified. Nevertheless, the absence of identifiable infectious agent, especially viral does not rule out its presence at a certain time – point and the concomitant long term triggering of an autoimmune cascade of events thereafter. Several concepts have emerged in an attempt to explain the autoimmune mechanisms and ongoing neurodegeneration in MS on the basis of the infectious – viral hypothesis.","Grigoriadis, Nikolaos; Hadjigeorgiou, Georgios M",J Autoimmune Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16504001/,67

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat emerging infectious diseases - Influenza A/B, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and now SARS-CoV 2. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Median time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%); Remdesivir (95%); antibiotics (100%), tocilizumab (65%); hemoperfusion (88%) or combination of these. Among the survivors, the median LOS was 15 days while non-survivors have a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed DVT despite anti-coagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH pvalue 0.04, CRP pvalue 0.00, Ferritin pvalue 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters - increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR; and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group is 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%. LOS and mortality rate did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients given CP vs controls.

Data evaluating the occurrence of breakthrough infections and impact of vaccination in decreasing transmission in congregate settings are limited. Skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents and staff members have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (4,5), and were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination (6,7). Starting December 28, 2020, all 78 Chicago-based SNFs began COVID-19 vaccination clinics over several weeks through the federal Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program (PPP).† In February 2021, through routine screening, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) identified a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a SNF resident >14 days after receipt of the second dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series. SARS-CoV-2 cases, vaccination status, and possible vaccine breakthrough infections were identified by matching facility reports with state case and vaccination registries. Among 627 persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 75 SNFs since vaccination clinics began, 22 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified among 12 residents and 10 staff members across 15 facilities ≥14 days after receiving their second vaccine dose (i.e., breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated persons). Nearly two thirds (14 of 22; 64%) of persons with breakthrough infections were asymptomatic; two residents were hospitalized because of COVID-19, and one died. No facility-associated secondary transmission occurred. Although few SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated persons were observed, these cases demonstrate the need for SNFs to follow recommended routine infection prevention and control practices and promote high vaccination coverage among SNF residents and staff members.","Teran, Richard A.; Walblay, Kelly A.; Shane, Elizabeth L.; Xydis, Shannon; Gretsch, Stephanie; Gagner, Alexandra; Samala, Usha; Choi, Hyeree; Zelinski, Christy; Black, Stephanie R.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914721/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7017e1,67

The number of actors in additive supply chain have reduced and thus in the time of epidemics that has been a boom and has helped manufacturers relying on additive manufacturing to be agile and react in nearly no time to the requirements.

CRCoV is a group 2 coronavirus most closely related to bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43. A real-time PCR assay was developed for the detection of CRCoV. The assay was validated against cell culture grown virus and shown to have a high level of sensitivity. A range of tissue samples were collected from dogs at a re-homing centre with a history of endemic respiratory disease. The samples were tested using a conventional nested PCR assay and CRCoV was quantitated by real-time PCR. CRCoV was detected most frequently in the nasal mucosa, nasal tonsil and trachea. It was also detected in the lung, and bronchial lymph node. Of the enteric tissues, only one mesenteric lymph node sample was positive. In addition two colon samples were positive for CRCoV by nested PCR only. In conclusion, CRCoV appears to infect the upper respiratory tract preferentially. The CRCoV real-time PCR assay has proved to be a highly specific and sensitive assay that can be applied for diagnostic purposes as well as to investigate further the tissue tropism of CRCoV.","Mitchell, Judy A.; Brooks, Harriet; Shiu, Kai-Biu; Brownlie, Joe; Erles, Kerstin",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19013196/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408003741; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.10.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408003741,67

In this study, search for potential inhibitors against two of the best characterized SARS-CoV-2 drug targets: S1 glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and main protease (3CL(Pro)), was carried out using the soy cheese peptides. A total of 1,420 peptides identified from the cheese peptidome produced using Lactobacillus delbrueckii WS4 were screened for antiviral activity by employing the web tools, AVPpred, and meta-iAVP. Molecular docking studies of the selected peptides revealed one potential peptide “KFVPKQPNMIL” that demonstrated strong affinity toward significant amino acid residues responsible for the host cell entry (RBD) and multiplication (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide was also assessed for its ability to interact with the critical residues of S1 RBD and 3CL(pro) of other β-coronaviruses. High binding affinity was observed toward critical amino acids of both the targeted proteins in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1. The binding energy of KFVPKQPNMIL against RBD and 3CL(pro) of the four viruses ranged from −8.45 to −26.8 kcal/mol and −15.22 to −22.85 kcal/mol, respectively. The findings conclude that cheese, produced by using Lb. delbrueckii WS4, could be explored as a prophylactic food for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. In addition, the multi-target inhibitor peptide, which effectively inhibited both the viral proteins, could further be used as a terminus a quo for the in vitro and in vivo function against SARS-CoV-2.","Chourasia, Rounak; Padhi, Srichandan; Chiring Phukon, Loreni; Abedin, Md Minhajul; Singh, Sudhir P.; Rai, Amit Kumar",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363209/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.601753,67

Herein, we disclose site‐selective C7−H activations of indoles by ruthenium(II) biscarboxylate catalysis under mild conditions. Base‐assisted internal electrophilic‐type substitution C−H ruthenation by weak O‐coordination enabled the C7−H functionalization of indoles and offered a broad scope, including C−N and C−C bond formation.

IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. RESULTS: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experimental 1-day-old chickens and resulted in 20% mortality, severe renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and trachea were observed in experimentally infected chickens. A protection study using the H120 live attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S1 sequence homology (97%). Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in kidney sections. CONCLUSION: Periodical evaluation of cross-protective capabilities of IBV vaccine(s) versus recently recovered field isolates should be performed to ensure optimum control of IBV.","Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S; El-Kady, Magdy F; Ladman, Brian S; Gelb, Jack",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16987422/,67
