45,"Injection drug use and HIV/AIDS in China: Review of current situation, prevention and policy implications",2006-02-01,"Illicit drug abuse and HIV/AIDS have increased rapidly in the past 10 to 20 years in China. This paper reviews drug abuse in China, the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its association with injection drug use (IDU), and Chinese policies on illicit drug abuse and prevention of HIV/AIDS based on published literature and unpublished official data. As a major drug trans-shipment country with source drugs from the ""Golden Triangle"" and ""Gold Crescent"" areas in Asia, China has also become an increasingly important drug consuming market. About half of China's 1.14 million documented drug users inject, and many share needles. IDU has contributed to 42% of cumulatively reported HIV/AIDS cases thus far. Drug trafficking is illegal in China and can lead to the death penalty. The public security departments adopt ""zero tolerance"" approach to drug use, which conflict with harm reduction policies of the public health departments. Past experience in China suggests that cracking down on drug smuggling and prohibiting drug use alone can not prevent or solve all illicit drug related problems in the era of globalization. In recent years, the central government has outlined a series of pragmatic policies to encourage harm reduction programs; meanwhile, some local governments have not fully mobilized to deal with drug abuse and HIV/AIDS problems seriously. Strengthening government leadership at both central and local levels; scaling up methadone substitution and needle exchange programs; making HIV voluntary counseling and testing available and affordable to both urban and rural drug users; and increasing utilization of outreach and nongovernmental organizations are offered as additional strategies to help cope with China's HIV and drug abuse problem.","Qian, Han-Zhu; Schumacher, Joseph E; Chen, Huey T; Ruan, Yu-Hua",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402269/,36
482,"The impact of sex, gender and pregnancy on 2009 H1N1 disease",2010-11-04,"Children and young adults of reproductive age have emerged as groups that are highly vulnerable to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The sex of an individual is a fundamental factor that can influence exposure, susceptibility and immune responses to influenza. Worldwide, the incidence, disease burden, morbidity and mortality rates following exposure to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus differ between males and females and are often age-dependent. Pregnancy and differences in the presentation of various risk factors contribute to the worse outcome of infection in women. Vaccination and antiviral treatment efficacy also vary in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, sex-specific genetic and hormonal differences may contribute to the severity of influenza and the clearance of viral infection. The contribution of sex and gender to influenza can only be determined by a greater consideration of these factors in clinical and epidemiological studies and increased research into the biological basis underlying these differences.","Klein, Sabra L; Passaretti, Catherine; Anker, Martha; Olukoya, Peju; Pekosz, Andrew",Biol Sex Differ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010100/,36

1231,The role of helium gas in medicine,2013-08-04,"The noble gas helium has many applications owing to its distinct physical and chemical characteristics, namely: its low density, low solubility, and high thermal conductivity. Chiefly, the abundance of studies in medicine relating to helium are concentrated in its possibility of being used as an adjunct therapy in a number of respiratory ailments such as asthma exacerbation, COPD, ARDS, croup, and bronchiolitis. Helium gas, once believed to be biologically inert, has been recently shown to be beneficial in protecting the myocardium from ischemia by various mechanisms. Though neuroprotection of brain tissue has been documented, the mechanism by which it does so has yet to be made clear. Surgeons are exploring using helium instead of carbon dioxide to insufflate the abdomen of patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal procedures due to its superiority in preventing respiratory acidosis in patients with comorbid conditions that cause carbon dioxide retention. Newly discovered applications in Pulmonary MRI radiology and imaging of organs in very fine detail using Helium Ion Microscopy has opened exciting new possibilities for the use of helium gas in technologically advanced fields of medicine.","Berganza, Carlos J; Zhang, John H",Med Gas Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3751721/,36

Methods: A total of 32 6-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were selected (averagely weighing 2.75–3.25 kg) and added TRI into nerve block solution for LPB. The rabbit were randomly divided into four groups: group A1: 2.5 ml × 2 times, group A2 2.5 ml × 4 times, group B1 5 ml × 2 times, and group B2 5 ml × 4 times; the time interval among the injection was 5 days, and the structural changes of FHC were the observed using 50/100/200 light microscope; the modified Mankin pathological scoring was also performed for the evaluation. Results: There exhibited significant microscopic changes of FHC structures between the rabbits performed LPB and the normal rabbits, among which group B2 exhibited the most serious FHC damages, and the Mankin pathological score in group B2 was much higher than those in the other three groups, and the scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions: The addition of TRI in LPB can damage the FHC structures, and large-dose (5 ml/once) and long-course (four times) will result in more serious injuries.","Wang, Dashou; Chen, Qian; Cai, Fengjun; Pan, Qi; Li, Xuesong; Wu, Qianming; Gan, Yong; Meng, Fei; Luo, Ping",Saudi Pharm J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447409/,36

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an empirical therapy of high-dose versus standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized open-label study to compare the changes of modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score and other clinical outcomes of the high-dose meropenem (2-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) versus the standard-dose meropenem (1-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) in sepsis and septic shock patients. Patients’ characteristics, clinical and microbiological outcomes, 14 and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital-free days, percent of the time of antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%T>MIC), and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. Median delta mSOFA was comparable between two groups (– 1 in the high-dose group vs. – 1 in the standard-dose group; P value = 0.75). There was no difference between the two groups regarding clinical and microbiological cure, 14- and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, and ICU- and hospital-free days. In patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) with a mSOFA score ≥ 7, the high-dose group demonstrated significantly better microbiological cure compared with the standard-dose group (75% (9/12 patients) vs. 20% (2/10 patients); P value = 0.03). Likewise, the high-dose group presented higher microbiological cure rate in patients admitted from ED who had either APACHE II score > 20 (83.3% (10/12) vs. 28.6% (2/7); P value = 0.045) or on mechanical ventilator (87.5% (7/8) vs. 23.1% (3/13); P value = 0.008) than the standard-dose group. Adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical therapy with the high-dose meropenem presented comparable clinical outcomes to the standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. Besides, subgroup analysis manifested superior microbiological cure rate in sepsis or septic shock patients admitted from ED.

(2020), “Indoor air nontoxicity should be proven with special techniques prior claiming that it may cause a variety of mental disorders.”",2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND: A predictive scoring system for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, which incorporates age, PaO(2)/FlO(2), and plateau pressure, APPS, was developed recently. It was validated externally in a Caucasian population but has not been studied in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to validate APPS in Korean ARDS patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with ARDS using the Berlin criteria and admitted to the medical ICU at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. The validation of the APPS was performed by evaluating its calibration and predictive accuracy. Its calibration was plotted and quantified using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Its predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC–ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were analyzed, 32 of whom survived. Of the 116 patients, 11 (9.5%) were classified as APPS grade 1 (score 3–4), 88 (75.9%) as grade 2 (score 5–7) and 17 (14.6%) as grade 3 (score 8–9). In-hospital mortality was 27.3% for grade 1, 73.9% for grade 2 and 94.1% for grade 3 (P for trend < 0.001). The APPS was well calibrated (Hosmer–Lemeshow test, P = 0.578) and its predictive accuracy was acceptable (AUC–ROC 0.704, 95% confidence interval 0.599–0.809). CONCLUSIONS: The APPS predicted in-hospital mortality in Korean patients with ARDS with similar power to its application in a Western population and with acceptable predictive accuracy.

11213,Strongyloides stercoralis Hyper infection Syndrome,2020-05-12,"PURPOSE: To assess the role of left ventricular overload and cumulated fluid balance in the development weaning-induced pulmonary edema (WIPO). METHODS: Ventilated patients in sinus rhythm with COPD and/or heart failure (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) were studied. Echocardiography was performed immediately before and during a 30-min spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) using a T-tube. Patients who failed were treated according to echocardiography results before undergoing a second SBT. RESULTS: Twelve of 59 patients failed SBT, all of them developing WIPO. Patients who succeeded SBT had lower body weight (− 2.5 kg [− 4.8; − 1] vs. + 0.75 kg [− 2.95; + 5.57]: p = 0.02) and cumulative fluid balance (− 2326 ml [− 3715; + 863] vs. + 143 ml [− 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.007) than those who developed WIPO. SBT-induced central hemodynamic changes were more pronounced in patients who developed WIPO, with higher E wave velocity (122 cm/s [92; 159] vs. 93 cm/s [74; 109]: p = 0.017) and E/A ratio (2.1 [1.2; 3.6] vs. 0.9 [0.8; 1.4]: p = 0.001), and shorter E wave deceleration time (85 ms [72; 125] vs. 147 ms [103; 175]: p = 0.004). After echocardiography-guided treatment, all patients who failed the first SBT were successfully extubated. Fluid balance was then negative (− 2224 ml [− 7056; + 100] vs. + 146 ml [− 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.005). Left ventricular filling pressures were lower (E/E′: 7.3 [5; 10.4] vs. 8.9 [5.9; 13.1]: p = 0.028); SBT-induced increase in E wave velocity (+ 10.6% [− 2.7/ + 18] vs. + 25.6% [+ 12.7/ + 49]: p = 0.037) and of mitral regurgitation area were significantly smaller. CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients, WIPO appears related to overloaded left ventricle associated with excessive fluid balance. SBT-induced central hemodynamic changes monitored by CCE help in guiding therapy for successful weaning.

11350,The recurrent bleeding risk of a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy can be indicated by high Rockall scores ≥ 6,2019-06-20,"Pneumonectomy after traumatic lung injury (TLI) is associated with shock, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventual right ventricular failure. Historically, trauma pneumonectomy (TP) mortality rates ranged between 53 and 100%. It is unclear if contemporary mortality rates have improved. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18–7.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR. Future investigations should focus on identifying parameters or treatment modalities that improve survivability after TP. We recommend that surgeons reserve TP as a last-resort management given the continued high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.","Homo, Richelle L.; Grigorian, Areg; Lekawa, Michael; Dolich, Matthew; Kuza, Catherine M.; Doben, Andrew R.; Gross, Ronald; Nahmias, Jeffry",Updates Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223758/,36

Three classical TCM prescriptions, namely Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction, Zhishi Xiebai Guizhi Decoction, and Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction, have been extensively used in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). Based on molecular network modeling, we performed a comparative pharmacogenomic analysis to systematically determine the drug-targeting spectrum of the three prescriptions at molecular level. Wide-area target molecules of CHD were covered, which was a common feature of the three decoctions, demonstrating their therapeutic functions. Meanwhile, collective signaling involved metabolic/pro-metabolic pathways, driving and transferring pathways, neuropsychiatric pathways, and exocrine or endocrine pathways. These organized pharmacological disturbance was mainly focused on almost all stages of CHD intervention, such as anti-atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, vascular wall function, foam cells formation, platelets aggregation, thrombosis, arrhythmia, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, heterogeneity analysis of the global pharmacological molecular spectrum revealed that signaling crosstalk, cascade convergence, and key targets were tendentious among the three decoctions. After all, it is unadvisable to rank the findings on targeting advantages of the three decoctions. Comparative pharmacological evidence may provide an appropriate decoction scheme for individualized intervention of CHD.","Zhang, Ying-ying; Zhao, Zi-de; Kong, Peng-yun; Gao, Lin; Yu, Ya-nan; Liu, Jun; Wang, Peng-qian; Li, Bing; Zhang, Xiao-xu; Yang, Li-qiang; Wang, Zhong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471444/,36

13901,Orbital exenteration and conjunctival melanoma: a 14-year study at the Jules Gonin Eye Hospital,2020-01-20,"Oxidative stress caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is the hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Among the first line of defense against oxidative stress is the dismutation of superoxide radicals, which in the mitochondria is carried out by manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2). In this study, wild-type (WT) and SOD2-heterozygous knockout (SOD2(+/−)) mice were exposed to CIH or normoxic (Nor) conditions. After 4 weeks, pulmonary artery pressure was measured, and the mice were processed to harvest either serum for cytokine assays or lungs for flow cytometry and histopathological studies. Herein, we showed that heterozygous deletion of SOD2 markedly deteriorated pulmonary remodeling and increased the oxidative stress, especially promoted the infiltration of macrophages in the lungs of CIH mouse. Moreover, in the intermittent hypoxia (IH)-treated RAW264.7 cells, SOD2 knockdown increased the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation accompanied with the IL-1β elevation and caspase-1 activity. Additionally, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) scavenger mito-TEMPO abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation in IH-treated RAW264.7 cells. Collectively, our results supported that SOD2 contributed to the pathogenesis of CIH-induced lung remodeling. Meanwhile, SOD2 knockdown exacerbates oxidative damage through assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. SOD2 may be a novel therapeutic target for CIH-induced pulmonary inflammation and arteriole remodeling.","Song, Jie-qiong; Jiang, Li-yan; Fu, Cui-ping; Wu, Xu; Liu, Zi-long; Xie, Liang; Wu, Xiao-dan; Hao, Sheng-yu; Li, Shan-qun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608479/,36
13907,Advanced robotic surgical systems in ophthalmology,2020-03-09,"Nystagmus is an eye movement disorder characterised by abnormal, involuntary rhythmic oscillations of one or both eyes, initiated by a slow phase. It is not uncommon in the UK and regularly seen in paediatric ophthalmology and adult general/strabismus clinics. In some cases, it occurs in isolation, and in others, it occurs as part of a multisystem disorder, severe visual impairment or neurological disorder. Similarly, in some cases, visual acuity can be normal and in others can be severely degraded. Furthermore, the impact on vision goes well beyond static acuity alone, is rarely measured and may vary on a minute-to-minute, day-to-day or month-to-month basis. For these reasons, management of children with nystagmus in the UK is varied, and patients report hugely different experiences and investigations.

15347,T‐MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples,2021-02-05,"OBJECTIVES: To address a gap in knowledge by simultaneously assessing a broad spectrum of individual socioeconomic and potential health determinants of suicidal ideation (SI) using validated measures in a large UK representative community sample. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional design, participants were recruited via random area probability sampling to participate in a comprehensive public health survey. The questionnaire examined demographic, health and socioeconomic factors. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify predictors of SI. SETTING: Community setting from high (n=20) and low (n=8) deprivation neighbourhoods across the North West of England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 4319 people were recruited between August 2015 and January 2016. There were 809 participants from low-deprivation neighbourhoods and 3510 from high-deprivation neighbourhoods. The sample comprised 1854 (43%) men and 2465 (57%) women. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: SI was the dependent variable which was assessed using item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 instrument. RESULTS: 454 (11%) participants reported having SI within the last 2 weeks. Model 1 (excluding mental health variables) identified younger age, black and minority ethnic (BME) background, lower housing quality and current smoker status as key predictors of SI. Higher self-esteem, empathy and neighbourhood belonging, alcohol abstinence and having arthritis were protective against SI. Model 2 (including mental health variables) found depression and having cancer as key health predictors for SI, while identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ) and BME were significant demographic predictors. Alcohol abstinence, having arthritis and higher empathy levels were protective against SI. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that it could be useful to increase community support and sense of belonging using a public health approach for vulnerable groups (e.g. those with cancer) and peer support for people who identify as LGBTQ and/or BME. Also, interventions aimed at increasing empathic functioning may prove effective for reducing SI.","Mulholland, Helen; McIntyre, Jason C; Haines-Delmont, Alina; Whittington, Richard; Comerford, Terence; Corcoran, Rhiannon",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868260/,36
15393,The impact of medical cannabis consumption on the oral flora and saliva,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND: As malaria incidence and transmission in a region decreases, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify areas of active transmission. Improved methods for identifying and monitoring foci of active malaria transmission are needed in areas of low parasite prevalence in order to achieve malaria elimination. Serological assays can provide population-level infection history to inform elimination campaigns. METHODS: A bead-based multiplex antibody detection assay was used to evaluate a chimeric Plasmodium vivax MSP1 protein (PvRMC-MSP1), designed to be broadly immunogenic for use in vaccine studies, to act as a pan-malaria serological tool based on its ability to capture IgG in plasma samples obtained from naturally exposed individuals. Samples from 236 US travellers with PCR confirmed infection status from all four major Plasmodium species infecting humans, Plasmodium falciparum (n = 181), Plasmodium vivax (n = 38), Plasmodium malariae (n = 4), and Plasmodium ovale (n = 13) were tested for IgG capture using PvRMC-MSP1 as well as the four recombinant MSP1-19 kD isoforms representative of these Plasmodium species. RESULTS: Regardless of infecting Plasmodium species, a large proportion of plasma samples from infected US travellers provided a high assay signal to the PvRMC-MSP1 chimeric protein, with 115 high responders out of 236 samples assessed (48.7%). When grouped by active infection, 38.7% P. falciparum-, 92.1% of P. vivax-, 75.0% P. malariae-, and 53.4% of P. ovale-infected individuals displayed high assay signals in response to PvRMC-MSP1. It was also determined that plasma from P. vivax-infected individuals produced increased assay signals in response to the PvRMC-MSP1 chimera as compared to the recombinant PvMSP1 for 89.5% (34 out of 38) of individuals. PvRMC-MSP1 also showed improved ability to capture IgG antibodies from P. falciparum-infected individuals when compared to the capture by recombinant PvMSP1, with high assay signals observed for 38.7% of P. falciparum-infected travellers in response to PvRMC-MSP1 IgG capture compared to just 1.1% who were high responders to capture by the recombinant PvMSP1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results support further study of designed antigens as an approach for increasing sensitivity or broadening binding capacity to improve existing serological tools for determining population-level exposure to Plasmodium species. Including both broad-reacting and Plasmodium species-specific antigen-coated beads in an assay panel could provide a nuanced view of population-level exposure histories, an extensive IgG profile, and detailed seroestimates. A more sensitive serological tool for detection of P. vivax exposure would aid malaria elimination campaigns in co-endemic areas and regions where P. vivax is the dominant parasite.","McCaffery, Jessica N.; Singh, Balwan; Nace, Douglas; Moreno, Alberto; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Rogier, Eric",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880512/,36

16773,Antikörpertherapie bei Patienten mit COVID-19,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Pain assessment in brain-injured patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is challenging and existing scales may not be representative of behavioral reactions expressed by this specific group. This study aimed to validate the French-Canadian and English revised versions of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT-Neuro) for brain-injured ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in three Canadian and one American sites. Patients with a traumatic or a non-traumatic brain injury were assessed with the CPOT-Neuro by trained raters (i.e., research staff and ICU nurses) before, during, and after nociceptive procedures (i.e., turning and other) and non-nociceptive procedures (i.e., non-invasive blood pressure, soft touch). Patients who were conscious and delirium-free were asked to provide their self-report of pain intensity (0–10). A first data set was completed for all participants (n = 226), and a second data set (n = 87) was obtained when a change in the level of consciousness (LOC) was observed after study enrollment. Three LOC groups were included: (a) unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS 4–8); (b) altered LOC (GCS 9–12); and (c) conscious (GCS 13–15). RESULTS: Higher CPOT-Neuro scores were found during nociceptive procedures compared to rest and non-nociceptive procedures in both data sets (p < 0.001). CPOT-Neuro scores were not different across LOC groups. Moderate correlations between CPOT-Neuro and self-reported pain intensity scores were found at rest and during nociceptive procedures (Spearman rho > 0.40 and > 0.60, respectively). CPOT-Neuro cut-off scores ≥ 2 and ≥ 3 were found to adequately classify mild to severe self-reported pain ≥ 1 and moderate to severe self-reported pain ≥ 5, respectively. Interrater reliability of raters’ CPOT-Neuro scores was supported with intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: The CPOT-Neuro was found to be valid in this multi-site sample of brain-injured ICU patients at various LOC.

18097,"Balancing Quality, Cost, and Access During Delivery of Newer Cellular and Immunotherapy Treatments",2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Foam surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) are widely used with the aim of preventing pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of foam beds, mattresses or overlays compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to foam beds, mattresses or overlays. Comparators were any beds, mattresses or overlays. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. If a foam surface was compared with surfaces that were not clearly specified, then the included study was recorded and described but not considered further in any data analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies (9566 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 101 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 47.0 to 85.3 years (median: 76.0 years). Participants were mainly from acute care settings. We analysed data for seven comparisons in the review: foam surfaces compared with: (1) alternating pressure air surfaces, (2) reactive air surfaces, (3) reactive fibre surfaces, (4) reactive gel surfaces, (5) reactive foam and gel surfaces, (6) reactive water surfaces, and (7) another type of foam surface. Of the 29 included studies, 17 (58.6%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: pressure ulcer incidence Low‐certainty evidence suggests that foam surfaces may increase the risk of developing new pressure ulcers compared with (1) alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 2.95; I(2) = 63%; 4 studies, 2247 participants), and (2) reactive air surfaces (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.54; I(2) = 25%; 4 studies, 229 participants). We are uncertain regarding the difference in pressure ulcer incidence in people treated with foam surfaces and the following surfaces: (1) reactive fibre surfaces (1 study, 68 participants); (2) reactive gel surfaces (1 study, 135 participants); (3) reactive gel and foam surfaces (1 study, 91 participants); and (4) another type of foam surface (6 studies, 733 participants). These had very low‐certainty evidence. Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer development for two comparisons. When time to ulcer development is considered using hazard ratios, the difference in the risk of having new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow‐up, between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces is uncertain (2 studies, 2105 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two further studies comparing different types of foam surfaces also reported time‐to‐event data, suggesting that viscoelastic foam surfaces with a density of 40 to 60 kg/m(3) may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over 11.5 days' follow‐up compared with foam surfaces with a density of 33 kg/m(3) (1 study, 62 participants); and solid foam surfaces may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over one month's follow‐up compared with convoluted foam surfaces (1 study, 84 participants). Both had low‐certainty evidence. There was no analysable data for the comparison of foam surfaces with reactive water surfaces (one study with 117 participants). Secondary outcomes Support‐surface‐associated patient comfort: the review contains data for three comparisons for this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort measure between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces (1 study, 76 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and different types of foam surfaces (4 studies, 669 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). All reported adverse events: the review contains data for two comparisons for this outcome. We are uncertain about differences in adverse effects between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (3 studies, 2181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and between foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Health‐related quality of life: only one study reported data on this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference (low‐certainty evidence) between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in health‐related quality of life measured with two different questionnaires, the EQ‐5D‐5L (267 participants) and the PU‐QoL‐UI (233 participants). Cost‐effectiveness: one study reported trial‐based cost‐effectiveness evaluations. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces in preventing pressure ulcer incidence (2029 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests uncertainty about the differences in pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort, adverse events and health‐related quality of life between using foam surfaces and other surfaces (reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces, reactive foam and gel surfaces, or reactive water surfaces). Foam surfaces may increase pressure ulcer incidence compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and reactive air surfaces. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future research in this area should consider evaluation of the most important support surfaces from the perspective of decision‐makers. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Trials should be designed to minimise the risk of detection bias; for example, by using digital photography and by blinding adjudicators of the photographs to group allocation. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179968/,36
18116,Patterns of noise exposure and prevalence of hearing loss amongst Cape Town Minstrel Carnival musicians,2021-05-31,"Suicide is an increasingly serious public health care concern worldwide. The impact of decreased in-house psychiatric resources on emergency care for suicidal patients has not been thoroughly examined. We evaluated the effects of closing an in-hospital psychiatric ward on the prehospital and emergency ward length of stay (LOS) and disposition location in patients who attempted suicide. This was a retrospective before-and-after study at a community emergency department (ED) in Japan. On March 31, 2014, the hospital closed its 50 psychiatric ward beds and outpatient consultation days were decreased from 5 to 2 days per week. Electronic health record data of suicidal patients who were brought to the ED were collected for 5 years before the decrease in in-hospital psychiatric services (April 1, 2009–March 31, 2014) and 5 years after the decrease (April 1, 2014–March 31, 2019). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to compare prehospital and emergency ward LOS, and discharge location between the 2 groups. Of the 1083 eligible patients, 449 (41.5%) were brought to the ED after the closure of the psychiatric ward. Patients with older age, burns, and higher comorbidity index values, and those requiring endotracheal intubation, surgery, and emergency ward admission, were more likely to receive ED care after the psychiatric ward closure. In the propensity matched analysis with 418 pairs, the after-closure group showed a significant increase in median prehospital LOS (44.0 minutes vs 51.0 minutes, P < .001) and emergency ward LOS (3.0 days vs 4.0 days, P = .014) compared with the before-closure group. The rate of direct home return was significantly lower in the after-closure group compared with the before-closure group (87.1% vs 81.6%, odds ratio: 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.45–0.96). The prehospital and emergency ward LOS for patients who attempted suicide in the study site increased significantly after a decrease in hospital-based mental health services. Conversely, there was significant reduction in direct home discharge after the decrease in in-house psychiatric care. These results have important implications for future policy to address the increasing care needs of patients who attempt suicide.","Ono, Yuko; Ono, Nozomi; Kakamu, Takeyasu; Ishida, Tokiya; Inoue, Shigeaki; Kotani, Joji; Shinohara, Kazuaki",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183698/,36
18161,Comments on: Repeatability of Orbscan III for anterior segment parameters in normal eyes,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Effective treatment of sepsis due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) remains a challenge for clinicians worldwide. In recent years, the combination of antibiotics has become the preferred treatment strategy for CR-GNB infection. However, robust evidence to support this approach is lacking. This systematic review aimed at critically evaluating all available antibiotic options for CR-GNB sepsis with particular focus on combination. METHODS: We systematically searched published literature from January 1945 until December 2018 for observational comparative and non-comparative studies and randomized trials examining any antibiotic option for CR-GNB. Studies were included if reporting microbiologically-confirmed infection caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacteriaceae/Klebsiella spp., or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, reporting at least one of the study outcomes, and definitive antibiotic treatment. Carbapenem-resistance was defined as phenotypically-detected in vitro resistance to at least one of the following carbapenems: doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem. Each antibiotic regimen was classified as “defined” when at least the molecular class(es) composing the regimen was detailed. Primary outcomes were 30-day and attributable mortality. Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) approach was selected for quantitative synthesis to explore feasibility of pooling data on antibiotic regimens. RESULTS: A total of 6306 records were retrieved and 134 studies including 11,546 patients were included: 54 studies were on Acinetobacter, 52 on Enterobacteriaceae/Klebsiella, 21 on mixed Gram-negative, and 7 on Pseudomonas. Nine (7%) were RCTs; 19 prospective cohorts (14%), 89 (66%) retrospective, and 17 (13%) case series. Forty-one studies (31%) were multicentric. Qualitative synthesis showed an heterogeneous and scattered reporting of key-clinical and microbiological variables across studies. Ninety-two distinct antibiotic regimens were identified with 47 of them (51%, 5863 patients) not reporting any details on numbers, type, dosage and in vitro activity of the included antibiotic molecules. The NMAs could not be performed for any of the selected outcome given the presence of too many disconnected components. CONCLUSION: The existing evidence is insufficient to allowing for the formulation of any evidence-based therapeutic recommendation for CR-GNB sepsis. Future studies must provide a standardized definition of antibiotic regimen to drive recommendations for using combination of antibiotics that can be reliably applied to clinical practice.

18515,A Mechanistic Model for Yoga as a Preventive and Therapeutic Modality,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Despite the clear risks of tobacco use, millions of people continue to smoke. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly called e-cigarettes, have been proposed as a substitute for those who are unwilling or unable to quit. Current systematic and narrative reviews on the health effects of ENDS use, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular effects, have come to differing conclusions. OBJECTIVE: We conducted two systematic reviews to critically assess and synthesize available human studies on the respiratory and cardiovascular health effects of ENDS substitution for people who smoke. The primary goal is to provide clinicians with evidence on the health effects of ENDS substitution to inform their treatment recommendations and plans. The twin goal of the reviews is to promote health literacy in ENDS users with facts on the health effects of ENDS. METHODS: These two reviews will be living systematic reviews. The systematic reviews will be initiated through a baseline review. Studies will be evaluated using the JBI quality assessment tools and a checklist of biases drawn from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine Catalogue of Bias. A narrative synthesis is planned because of the heterogeneity of data. A search for recently published studies will be conducted every 3 months, and an updated review will be published every 6 months for the duration of the project or possibly longer. RESULTS: The baseline and updated reviews will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings of the reviews will be reported in a white paper for clinicians and a fact sheet for people who use ENDS. CONCLUSIONS: The substitution of ENDS for cigarettes is one way to potentially reduce the risks of smoking. Clinicians and their patients need to understand the potential benefits and possible risks of substituting ENDS for cigarettes. Our living systematic reviews seek to highlight the best and most up-to-date evidence in this highly contentious and fast-moving field of research.

19121,How Does Diet Influence Our Lives? Evaluating the Relationship between Isotopic Signatures and Mortality Patterns in Italian Roman Imperial and Medieval Periods,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: The Nice terror attack of July 14, 2016 resulted in 84 deaths and 434 injured, with many hospital staff exposed to the attack, either as bystanders on site at the time of the attack (‘bystander exposure’) who may or may not have provided care to attack victims subsequently, or as care providers to victims only (‘professional exposure only’). The objective of this study is to describe the impact on mental health among hospital staff by category of exposure with a particular focus on those with ‘professional exposure only’, and to assess their use of psychological support resources. METHOD: An observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted from 06/20/2017 to 10/31/2017 among all staff of two healthcare institutions in Nice, using a web questionnaire. Collected data included social, demographic and professional characteristics; trauma exposure category (‘bystanders to the attack’; ‘professional exposure only’; ‘unexposed’); indicators of psychological impact (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); PTSD (PCL-5) level; support sought. Responders could enter open comments in each section of the questionnaire, which were processed by inductive analysis. RESULTS: 804 staff members’ questionnaires were analysed. Among responding staff, 488 were exposed (61%): 203 were ‘bystanders to the attack’, 285 had ‘professional exposure only’. The staff with ‘professional exposure only’ reported anxiety (13.2%), depression (4.6%), suicidal thoughts (5.5%); rates of full PTSD was 9.4% and of partial PTSD, 17.7%. Multivariate analysis in the ‘professional exposure only’ category showed that the following characteristics were associated with full or partial PTSD: female gender (OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 1.19–6.56, p = 0.019); social isolation (OR = 3.80; 95% CI = 1.30–11.16, p = 0.015); having been confronted with an unfamiliar task (OR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.18–7.85; p = 0.022). Lastly, 70.6% of the staff with ‘professional exposure only’ with full PTSD did not seek psychological support. CONCLUSION: Despite a significant impact on mental health, few staff with ‘professional exposure only’ sought psychological support. Robust prevention and follow-up programs must be developed for hospital staff, in order to manage the health hazards they face when exposed to exceptional health-related events such as mass terror attacks. STUDY REGISTRATION: Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the National Ethics Committee for Human Research (RCBID N° 2017-A00812–51).","Bentz, Laurence; Vandentorren, Stéphanie; Fabre, Roxane; Bride, Jeremy; Pirard, Philippe; Doulet, Nadège; Baubet, Thierry; Motreff, Yvon; Pradier, Christian",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8272451/,36
19687,Novel device to contain aerosols during phacoemulsification,2021-05-21,"In diabetes mellitus, the wound healing process is impaired and delayed. Plants are actively investigated for safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment options for wound. The plant Buddleja polystachya has a traditional claim for the treatment of wound. Fresh leaves are crushed and given for topical application. The objective of this study was to evaluate the wound healing activity of hydro-alcoholic extract and solvent fractions of leaves of B. polystachya fresen (Buddlejaceae) in normal and diabetic mice. METHOD: B. polystachya leaves were extracted using 80% methanol and further fractionated using chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water. The wound healing activity was tested using excision, incision, and diabetic wound models. Area of wound contraction, time of epithelialization, and wound breaking strength were determined. RESULT: Treatment with 5% w/w (P < 0 0.05) and 10% w/w (P < 0.001) crude extract of B. polystachya significantly lowered wound area as compared to simple ointment. Treatment of excision wound with 5% w/w and 10% w/w of chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions of B. polystachya significantly lowered wound area and epithelization period (P < 0.05). The 10% w/w extract of B. polystachya showed a significant area of diabetic wound contraction compared to 5% w/w extract and simple ointment. The 10% w/w and 5% w/w extracts of B. polystachya significantly increased wound breaking strength compared to untreated and simple ointment groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The crude and the solvent fractions of B. Polystachya leaves possess wound healing activities as evidenced by an increase in tensile strength and wound contraction rate and decrease in the epithelialization period. This finding supports the traditional claims of B. polystachya for the healing of wounds.","Getahun, Abiey; Kifle, Zemene Demelash; Ambikar, Digambar; Atnafie, Seyfe Asrade",Metabol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319790/,36

The motivations arise from the Adaptive Optics field, where the MVM is the core of the real-time control algorithm which controls the mirrors of a telescope to compensate for the effects of the atmospheric turbulence. The proposed implementation of the MVM exploits four different levels of parallelism: spatial and pipeline parallelism are used both at the fine (scalar instructions) and at the coarse (vector instructions) levels. To characterize the architecture being developed, a performance model has been developed and validated through the actual results obtained from runs on a prototype board based on the Intel ARRIA10 FPGA. Some details are given to describe how the algorithm has been implemented using the QuickPlay HLS flow.

The individual characteristics of respondents and the organisational characteristics of the hotels they currently worked in played little role in their perceptions of service robots. The managers considered that robots would decrease the quality of the service and were generally not ready to use robots.

Current commercial vaccines provide limited cross-protection with several drawbacks such as safety, immunosuppression, potential reversion to virulence, and induction of neonatal pancytopenia. This study evaluates two prototype vaccines containing multiple rationally designed recombinant mosaic BVDV antigens for their potential to confer cross-protection against diverse BVDV strains. Genes encoding three novel mosaic antigens, designated E2(123), NS2-3(1), and NS2-3(2), were designed in silico and expressed in mammalian cells for the formulation of a prototype protein-based vaccine. The mosaic antigens contain highly conserved protective epitopes from BVDV-1a, -1b, and -2, and included unique neutralizing epitopes from disparate strains to broaden coverage. We tested immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Expi293(TM)-expressed mosaic antigens (293F-E2(123), 293F-NS2-3(1), and 293F-NS2-3(2)), and baculovirus-expressed E2(123) (Bac-E2(123)) mosaic antigen in calves. The Expi293(TM)-expressed antigen cocktail induced robust BVDV-specific cross-reactive IFN-γ responses, broadly neutralizing antibodies, and following challenge with a BVDV-1b strain, the calves had significantly (p < 0.05) reduced viremia and clinical BVD disease compared to the calves vaccinated with a commercial killed vaccine. The Bac-E2(123) antigen was not as effective as the Expi293(TM)-expressed antigen cocktail, but it protected calves from BVD disease better than the commercial killed vaccine. The findings support feasibility for development of a broadly protective subunit BVDV vaccine for safe and effective management of BRD.","Sangewar, Neha; Hassan, Wisam; Lokhandwala, Shehnaz; Bray, Jocelyn; Reith, Rachel; Markland, Mary; Sang, Huldah; Yao, Jianxiu; Fritz, Bailey; Waghela, Suryakant D.; Abdelsalam, Karim W.; Chase, Christopher C.

44753,Heat and moisture exchanger filter in a paediatric patient: A dilemma for anaesthesiologists- to use or not to use?,2020-11-01,"Based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Models-3 community multi-scale air quality model (WRF-CMAQ), this study analyzes the impacts of meteorological conditions and changes in air pollutant emissions on the heavy air pollution episode occurred over North China around the 2020 Spring Festival (January to Februray 2020). Regional reductions in air pollutant emissions required to eliminate the PM(2.5) heavy pollution episode are also quantified. Our results found that meteorological conditions for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding “2+26” cities are the worst during the heavy pollution episode around the 2020 Spring Festival as compared with two other typical heavy pollution episodes that occurred after 2015. However, because of the substantial reductions in air pollutant emissions in the “2+26” cities in recent years, and the 32% extra reduction in emissions during January to February 2020 compared with the baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020, the maximum PM(2.5) level during this heavy pollution episode around the 2020 Spring Festival was much lower than that in the other two typical episodes. Yet, these emission reductions are still not enough to eliminate regional heavy pollution episodes. Compared with the actual emission levels during January to February 2020, a 20% extra reduction in air pollutant emissions in the “2+26” cities (or a 45% extra reduction compared with baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020) could help to generally eliminate regionwide severe pollution episodes, and avoid heavy pollution episodes that last three or more consecutive days in Beijing; a 40% extra reduction in emissions (or a 60% extra reduction compared with baseline emission levels of the autumn and winter of 2019 to 2020) could help to generally eliminate regionwide and continuous heavy pollution episodes. Our analysis finds that during the clean period after the heavy pollution episode around the 2020 Spring Festival, the regionwide heavy pollution episode would only occur with at least a 10-fold increase in air pollutant emissions.","Xue, Wenbo; Shi, Xurong; Yan, Gang; Wang, Jinnan; Xu, Yanling; Tang, Qian; Wang, Yanli; Zheng, Yixuan; Lei, Yu",Sci China Earth Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807214/,36

Full Lambek calculus gives a framework to uniformly represent different logical systems as extensions of it. Here we define higher-order Full Lambek calculus, which boils down to higher-order intuitionistic logic when equipped with all the structural rules, and give categorical semantics for (any extension of) it in terms of triposes or higher-order Lawvere hyperdoctrines, which were originally conceived for intuitionistic logic, and yet are flexible enough to be adapted for substructural logics. Relativising the completeness result thus obtained to different axioms, we can obtain tripos-theoretical completeness theorems for a broad variety of higher-order logics. The framework thus developed, moreover, allows us to obtain tripos-theoretical Girard and Kolmogorov translation theorems for higher-order logics.","Maruyama, Yoshihiro",Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991238/,36

Another issue raised in the article is the acceptance of people with various types of disabilities in terms of their possible employment. We checked the differentiation of acceptance among employers from different countries. This article uses representative samples of respondents from two studies—the CATI research (2019) on samples of Polish employers and co-workers, and the CAWI research (2021) on samples of employers from Poland and Finland. The analysis methods used included confirmatory factor analysis, nested models and nonparametric analysis of variance. The research confirmed the resistance of the ADS scale to respondents’ characteristics, and found no differences for nested models constructed for groups based on categorical variables characterizing the respondents. As for acceptance of various types of disability in the workplace, significant differences were found in the statements of employers from Poland and Finland.","Grześkowiak, Alicja; Załuska, Urszula; Kozyra, Cyprian; Kwiatkowska-Ciotucha, Dorota",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156639/,36

Indeed, the coefficients of the IDW equation, power, and the influence distance were modified by applying the ICA algorithm. For this, an example was solved by using IDW, the ordinary kriging, and IDW-ICA. After successfully validating the IDW-ICA, the iron grades were estimated in the Baba Ali iron mine, the most prominent iron mine in the west of Iran. For this, after gathering data from thirty-two boreholes, the grade estimations were conducted using IDW, kriging, and IDW-ICA. Some statistical parameters, including the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient, were used to compare the results. The higher value of the R(2), 94.41%, the lowest values of MAPE, 17.4%, and RMSE, 4.19, of the proposed algorithm, revealed that the IDW-ICA could be applied as a new-fangled method for grade estimations in the mining projects.","Shamsi, Reza; Dehghani, Hesam; Jalali, Mohammad; Jodeiri Shokri, Behshad",Arab J Geosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282408/,36

The way some of these strategies are engineered has been criticised and portfolio insurance itself blamed for increasing market volatility in depressed markets. Despite this, investors keep on buying portfolio insurance that keeps its solid market share. This study contributes to understand the phenomenon. We compare individual investors’ decision using two distinct frameworks: expected utility theory and behavioural theories. Based upon Monte Carlo simulation techniques we compare portfolio insurance strategies against uninsured basic benchmark strategies, for a wide variety of market scenarios. We conclude that cumulative prospect theory may be a viable framework to explain the popularity of portfolio insurance.

Incidence estimates of pneumonia confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic tests are needed. METHODS We conducted active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults 18 years of age or older in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville. Patients with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression were excluded. Blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for culture, serologic testing, antigen detection, and molecular diagnostic testing. Study radiologists independently reviewed chest radiographs. We calculated population-based incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization according to age and pathogen. RESULTS From January 2010 through June 2012, we enrolled 2488 of 3634 eligible adults (68%). Among 2320 adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia (93%), the median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 46 to 71); 498 patients (21%) required intensive care, and 52 (2%) died. Among 2259 patients who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens available for both bacterial and viral testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%): one or more viruses in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacterial and viral pathogens in 59 (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%). The annual incidence of pneumonia was 24.8 cases (95% confidence interval, 23.5 to 26.1) per 10,000 adults, with the highest rates among adults 65 to 79 years of age (63.0 cases per 10,000 adults) and those 80 years of age or older (164.3 cases per 10,000 adults). For each pathogen, the incidence increased with age. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was highest among the oldest adults. Despite current diagnostic tests, no pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria.

Georgia announced a state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) of COVID-19 in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and environs from March 2, 2020, to November 20, 2020. METHODS We analyzed the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and its surrounding counties, and estimated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. We used a 9-day correction for the date of report to analyze the data by assumed date of infection. RESULTS The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March to < 2 in late March to around 1 from mid-April to November. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. Then, Rt fluctuated around 1 in May through November. Counties surrounding Dougherty County registered an increase in Rt estimates days after a superspreading event occurred in the area. CONCLUSIONS In Spring 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, because restrictions were relaxed in late April and elections were conducted in November, community transmission continued, with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of November 2020. The superspreading event in Dougherty County affected surrounding areas, indicating the possibility of local transmission in neighboring counties.","Muniz-Rodriguez, Kamalich; Chowell, Gerardo; Schwind, Jessica S; Ford, Randall; Ofori, Sylvia K; Ogwara, Chigozie A; Davies, Margaret R; Jacobs, Terrence; Cheung, Chi-Hin; Cowan, Logan T; Hansen, Andrew R; Chun-Hai Fung, Isaac",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/20.232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970085/,36

62155,The mother of invention-introduction of a novel inflatable stent for McIndoe neovagina.,2021-03-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious global health threat. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the HCoV-OC43 model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anti-coronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist (diABZI) robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.ImportanceThe highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health. Other coronaviruses are likely to jump from a non-human animal to humans in the future. Novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics are therefore needed to control known pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its newly mutated variants, as well as future coronavirus outbreaks. STING signaling is a well-established host defense pathway, but its role in coronavirus infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that activation of the STING signaling pathway robustly inhibits infection of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These results identified the STING pathway as a novel target for controlling the spread of known pathogenic coronaviruses as well as emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, Wei; Reyes, Hanako M; Yang, June F; Li, Yize; Stewart, Kathleen M; Basil, Maria C; Lin, Susan M; Katzen, Jeremy; Morrisey, Edward E; Weiss, Susan R; You, Jianxin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00490-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789998/,36
62206,"Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 in Africa: availability, challenges and implications.",2020,"We recently reported that plasma insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) concentrations increased soon after endogenous and exogenous stimulations of LH in male goats and bulls. However, the effects of LH suppression on INSL3 secretion are unknown in domestic animals. Here, we examined the effects of a long-acting GnRH antagonist (degarelix acetate; 4 mg/kg) on the secretions of plasma INSL3 and testosterone in two phases, an immediate and a long-term phase in male goats (n = 6; aged, 13-16 months). During the immediate phase, blood was taken at 15-minute intervals for 8 hours on Days -5, 0, and 3. The GnRH antagonist was administered after 2-hour sampling of Day 0. Moreover, a daily blood sample was taken from Day 0 to Day 7, followed by twice a week until 9 weeks and finally at week 10. The scrotal circumference was recorded before treatment and continued biweekly until week 10. Concentrations of LH, INSL3, and testosterone in plasma were determined by EIA and the pulsatile nature of secretion analyzed using pulse XP software. The mean concentrations, pulse frequency (per hour), and pulse amplitude (peak-nadir) of plasma LH and testosterone reduced from pretreatment to posttreatment Day 0 and Day 3 (P < 0.05). A decline in mean concentrations, pulse frequency, and pulse amplitude of INSL3 was exhibited on posttreatment Day 3 compared with pretreatment (P < 0.01). During long-term sampling, a decline (P < 0.01) in plasma testosterone and INSL3 concentrations was observed 1 day after treatment and remained lower until 8.5 weeks after treatment, and thereafter returned to pretreatment levels. A reduction in scrotal circumference was recorded 4 weeks after treatment and remained lower until 10 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the acute regulation of INSL3 by LH was confirmed by reduction of plasma INSL3 levels within 3 days after GnRH antagonist treatment in male goats. Although the onset of suppression of testosterone was more rapid than that of INSL3, the low levels persisted for 8.5 weeks for both hormones, and subsequently the concentrations returned to pretreatment levels. A significant reduction in testicular size was also observed. The quick, long-lasting, and transient suppression of testosterone and INSL3 after a single injection implies a potential application of this antagonist in reversible long-term chemical castration in male goats.","Hannan, M A; Kawate, N; Fukami, Y; Weerakoon, W W P N; Büllesbach, E E; Inaba, T; Tamada, H",Theriogenology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.09.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793455/,36

Analyses controlled for age, education, race, total medical conditions, and COVID-19 status. RESULTS Higher COVID-19 media exposure was associated with higher COVID-19 anxiety among men (not women) and higher perceived risk/severity in both sexes. Higher COVID-19 media dependency was associated with higher COVID-19 anxiety and perceived risk/severity in both sexes. CONCLUSION In middle-aged/older adults, the use/dependency of media for COVID-19 information may be linked to negative psychological health and increased COVID-19 perceived risk and severity. Men may be at increased risk of anxiety related to media exposure.","Curtis, Ashley F; Rodgers, Mikayla; Miller, Mary Beth; McCrae, Christina S",Journal of aging and health,https://doi.org/10.1177/08982643211025383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114480/,36
62659,Clinical Rounds.,2017,"BACKGROUND Six key behavioural risk factors (risky alcohol use, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour and unhealthy sleep patterns) have been identified as strong determinants of chronic disease, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers. School-based interventions targeting these multiple health risk behaviours among adolescents have the potential to halt the trajectory towards later disease, whilst online and mobile technology interventions offer advantages in terms of student engagement, reach and scalability. Despite this, the efficacy of eHealth school-based interventions targeting these six health risk behaviours among adolescents has not been evaluated. The proposed systematic review aims to address this by determining the nature and efficacy of existing eHealth school-based interventions targeting multiple health risk behaviours among adolescents. METHODS A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library databases will be conducted to identify eligible published papers. Eligible studies will be randomised controlled trials, including cluster randomised controlled trials, of interventions targeting two or more of the following lifestyle risk behaviours: alcohol use, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour and sleep. Eligible studies will be those evaluating interventions delivered in a secondary school setting among participants 11-18 years of age, via an eHealth platform (Internet, computers of mobile technology). Two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data and assess the risk of bias. Study outcomes will be summarised in a narrative synthesis, and meta-analyses will be conducted where it is appropriate to combine studies. DISCUSSION It is anticipated that the results from this review will serve to inform the development of future eHealth multiple health behaviour interventions for adolescents by identifying common characteristics of effective programs and highlighting knowledge gaps in the evidence base.

The most efficacious palliative care interventions, the optimal model of their delivery and the most appropriate outcome measures in ICU are not clear. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and observational studies to evaluate the number and types of palliative care interventions implemented within the ICU setting, to assess their impact on ICU practice and to evaluate differences in palliative care approaches across different countries. RESULTS Fifty-eight full articles were identified, including 9 randomised trials and 49 cohort studies; all but 4 were conducted within North America. Interventions were categorised into five themes: communication (14, 24.6%), ethics consultations (5, 8.8%), educational (18, 31.6%), involvement of a palliative care team (28, 49.1%) and advance care planning or goals-of-care discussions (7, 12.3%). Thirty studies (51.7%) proposed an integrative model, whilst 28 (48.3%) reported a consultative one. The most frequently reported outcomes were ICU or hospital length of stay (33/55, 60%), limitation of life-sustaining treatment decisions (22/55, 40%) and mortality (15/55, 27.2%). Quantitative assessment of pooled data was not performed due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes between studies. CONCLUSION Beneficial effects on the most common outcomes were associated with strategies to enhance palliative care involvement, either with an integrative or a consultative approach. Few studies reported functional outcomes for ICU patients. Almost all studies were from North America, limiting the generalisability to other healthcare systems.","Metaxa, Victoria; Anagnostou, Despina; Vlachos, Savvas; Arulkumaran, Nishkantha; Besemmane, Sherihane; van Dusseldorp, Ingeborg; Aslakson, Rebecca A; Davidson, Judy E; Gerritsen, Rik T; Hartog, Christiane; Curtis, J Randall",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06544-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652465/,36

This hesitancy to engage creates access to care barriers for people living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted a systematic review to identify educational interventions focused on developing HIV competencies in higher education across health science disciplines. We searched databases for primary studies focused on interventions. Using PRISMA guidelines, we identified 20 articles from 19 distinct studies. While there was an overwhelming body of literature that assessed knowledge, skills, and attitudes in health sciences students on HIV and AIDS, the low number of intervention studies was notable. With the exception of two studies, PLWH were not included in the interventions. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the well-established Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV and/or AIDS (GIPA) and Meaningful Engagement of People Living with HIV and/or AIDS (MEPA) principles. The primary means of the educational intervention was focused on delivering lectures to address HIV and AIDS knowledge for HCP. There was a significant lack of focus on historical, cultural, policy and legal contexts of HIV and AIDS care; theoretical justifications for the interventions were absent. No study focused on the impact of an intervention on the care provided to PLWH by HCP after graduation. There is an urgent need to develop long-term sustainable and scalable interventions that address the consistently identified lack of knowledge and skills, and stigmatizing attitudes of HCP and students.","Phillips, J Craig; Caine, Vera; Dewart, Georgia; de Padua, Anthony; Dela Cruz, Añiela M; Rickards, Tracey; McGinn, Maggie; Cator, Stephany; Pauly, Bernadette Bernie; Gagnon, Marilou",AIDS care,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2018.1510108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112926/,36

64743,Powered air-purifying respirator use in healthcare: Effects on thermal sensations and comfort.,2017,"BACKGROUND Free jejunal interposition is a useful technique for reconstruction of the cervical esophagus. However, the distal anastomosis between the graft and the remaining thoracic esophagus or a gastric conduit can be technically challenging when located very low in the thoracic aperture. We here describe a modified technique for retrograde stapling of a jejunal graft to a failed gastric conduit using a circular stapler on a delivery system. CASE PRESENTATION A 56 year-old patient had been referred for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at 20 cm from the incisors. On day 8 after thoracoabdominal esophagectomy with gastric pull-up, an anastomotic leakage was diagnosed. A proximal-release stent was successfully placed by gastroscopy and the patient was discharged. Two weeks later, an esophagotracheal fistula occurred proximal to the esophageal stent. Cervical esophagostomy was performed with cranial closure of the gastric conduit, which was left in situ within the right hemithorax. Three months later, reconstruction was performed using a free jejunal interposition. The anvil of a circular stapler (Orvil®, Covidien) was placed transabdominally through an endoscopic rendez-vous procedure into the gastric conduit. A free jejunal graft was retrogradely stapled to the proximal end of the conduit. Microvascular anastomoses were performed subsequently. The proximal anastomosis of the conduit was completed manually after reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS This modified technique allows stapling of a jejunal interposition graft located deep in the thoracic aperture and is therefore a useful method that may help to avoid reconstruction by colonic pull-up and thoracotomy.","Hackl, Christina; Popp, Felix C; Ehehalt, Katharina; Dendl, Lena-Marie; Benseler, Volker; Renner, Philipp; Loss, Martin; Dolderer, Jurgen; Prantl, Lukas; Kühnel, Thomas; Schlitt, Hans J; Dahlke, Marc H",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319372/,36

Evolution has enabled differentiation of species. Pathogens likewise have evolved within various species and mostly come to a settled dynamic equilibrium such that co-existence results (pathogens ideally should not kill their hosts). Problems arise when pathogens jump species because the new host had not developed any resistance. These infections from related species are known as zoonoses. COVID-19 is the latest example of a virus entering another species but HIV (and various strains of influenza) were previous examples. HIV entered the human population from monkeys in Africa. These two papers outline the underlying principle of HIV and the differing epidemiologies in Africa, the USA and in Edinburgh. The underlying immunosuppression of HIV in Africa was initially hidden behind common infections and HIV first came to world awareness in focal areas of the USA as a disease seemingly limited to gay males.

65810,New international reporting guidelines for clinical trials evaluating effectiveness of artificial intelligence interventions in dermatology: strengthening the SPIRIT of robust trial reporting.,2021-03-01,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious pregnancy complication, affecting about 5-7% of pregnancies worldwide and is characterized by hypertension and damage to multiple maternal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. PE usually begins after 20 weeks' gestation and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications and lifelong disabilities-even death-in both the mother and the infant. As delivery is the only cure for the disease, treatment is primarily focused on the management of blood pressure and other clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of PE is still not clear. Abnormal spiral artery remodeling, placental ischemia and a resulting increase in the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), also called soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), are believed to be among the primary pathologies associated with PE. sFlt-1 is produced mainly in the placenta during pregnancy and acts as a decoy receptor, binding to free VEGF (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF), resulting in the decreased bioavailability of each to target cells. Despite the pathogenic effects of increased sFlt-1 on the maternal vasculature, recent studies from our laboratory and others have strongly indicated that the increase in sFlt-1 in PE may fulfill critical protective functions in preeclamptic pregnancies. Thus, further studies on the roles of sFlt-1 in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies are warranted for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling for the treatment of PE. Another impediment to the treatment of PE is the lack of suitable methods for delivery of cargo to placental cells, as PE is believed to be of placental origin and most available therapies for PE adversely impact both the mother and the fetus. The present review discusses the pathogenesis of PE, the complex role of sFlt-1 in maternal disease and fetal protection, and the recently developed placenta-targeted drug delivery system for the potential treatment of PE with candidate therapeutic agents.","Jena, Manoj Kumar; Sharma, Neeta Raj; Petitt, Matthew; Maulik, Devika; Nayak, Nihar Ranjan",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10060953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599856/,36

We have developed a smartphone app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results, from individuals in the United States, and have assessed whether symptom and sensor data can differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. We enrolled 30,529 participants between 25 March and 7 June 2020, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms. Of these symptomatic individuals, 54 reported testing positive and 279 negative for COVID-19. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.73-0.86) for discriminating between symptomatic individuals who were positive or negative for COVID-19, a performance that is significantly better (P < 0.01) than a model1 that considers symptoms alone (AUC = 0.71; IQR: 0.63-0.79).

This study compares these 2 techniques in female patients who are in need of an elective cholecystectomy. BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a surgical concept permitting scarless intra-abdominal operations through natural orifices, such as the vagina. Because of the lack of an adequately powered trial, we designed this first randomized controlled study for the comparison of TVC and NC. METHODS This prospective, randomized, nonblinded, single-center trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of TVC (intervention), compared with NC (control) in female patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. The primary endpoint was intensity of pain until the morning of postoperative day (POD) 2. Secondary outcomes were among others intra- and postoperative complications, procedural time, amount of analgesics used, pain intensity until POD 10, duration of hospital stay, satisfaction with the aesthetic result, and quality of life on POD 10 as quantified with the Eypasch Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). RESULTS Between February 2010 and June 2012, 40 patients were randomly assigned to the interventional or control group. All patients completed follow-up. Procedural time, length of postoperative hospital stay, and the rate of intra- and postoperative complications were similar in the 2 groups. However, significant advantages were found for the transvaginal access regarding pain until POD 2, but also until POD 10 (P = 0.043 vs P = 0.010) despite significantly less use of peripheral analgesics (P = 0.019). In the TVC group, patients were significantly more satisfied with the aesthetic result (P < 0.001) and had a significantly better GIQLI (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS Although comparable in terms of safety, TVC caused less pain, increased satisfaction with the aesthetic result, and improved postoperative quality of life in the short term.","Bulian, Dirk Rolf; Knuth, Jürgen; Cerasani, Nicola; Sauerwald, Axel; Lefering, Rolf; Heiss, Markus Maria",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24108196/,36

Hepatic dysfunction and the slight elevation of liver enzymes have been reported in cases of COVID-19 infection. Transient hyperphosphatasemia is a benign condition characterized by the elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and the return to normal levels within weeks or months of first observation. We reported the first infant case of severe hyperphosphatasemia because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a 9-month-old child admitted to the Pediatric Covid-19 Unit of Amiens University Hospital. Given the hepatic tropism and COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory reactions, our case suggests that, an isolated severe hyperphosphatasemia in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection should increase the possibility of transient hyperphosphatasemia, even if is also demonstrated a classic natural history of the transient hyperphosphatasemia during viral infection, especially in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tchidjou, Hyppolite Kuekou; Caron, Fiorella; Ferec, Adeline; Braun, Karine; Hery, Loic; Castelain, Sandrine; Romeo, Bernard",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000000954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32897891/,36

METHODS Epidemiological surveillance at the Cà Foncello Hospital (Veneto, Italy) since 24 February 2020 to 24 April 2020 when the municipality of Treviso was hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The number of naso-pharigeal (NP) swabs performed was 7010. RESULTS The number of infected among healthcare workers was 209/ 3924 (5.32%): medical doctors: 28 cases / 498 (5.6%). None among ophthalmologists; specialized nurses: 86/1294 (6.4%) None in the ophthalmic unit; intermediate care technicians: 68/463 (14.7%). The 46% of the positive tested were asymptomatic. We share key suggested actions for the reorganization in ophthalmological services: be part of a global epidemiological local strategy of containment (Testing, Tracing, Treating); protect your department: Keep on screening patients by telephone interview before entering the hospital; promote continuous and appropriate use of PPE both for doctors and for patients; make any effort to obtain a continuous flow of patients in every line of the ophthalmic service; treat appropriately any single patient with vision threatening condition; avoid unnecessary or futile testings and examinations. CONCLUSION The Treviso model shows that it is possible and safe to keep on performing high risk hospital activities like ophthalmology, even in the epicenter of covid outbreak, if adequate actions are performed.

A mouse model of acute SARS-CoV infection has been helpful in understanding the host response to infection; however, there are still unanswered questions concerning SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We have shown that STAT1 plays an important role in the severity of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and that it is independent of the role of STAT1 in interferon signaling. Mice lacking STAT1 have greater weight loss, severe lung pathology with pre-pulmonary-fibrosis-like lesions, and an altered immune response following infection with SARS-CoV. We hypothesized that STAT1 plays a role in the polarization of the immune response, specifically in macrophages, resulting in a worsened outcome. To test this, we created bone marrow chimeras and cell-type-specific knockouts of STAT1 to identify which cell type(s) is critical to protection from severe lung disease after SARS-CoV infection. Bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that hematopoietic cells are responsible for the pathogenesis in STAT1(-/-) mice, and because of an induction of alternatively activated (AA) macrophages after infection, we hypothesized that the AA macrophages were critical for disease severity. Mice with STAT1 in either monocytes and macrophages (LysM/STAT1) or ciliated lung epithelial cells (FoxJ1/STAT1) deleted were created. Following infection, LysM/STAT1 mice display severe lung pathology, while FoxJ1/STAT1 mice display normal lung pathology. We hypothesized that AA macrophages were responsible for this STAT1-dependent pathology and therefore created STAT1/STAT6(-/-) double-knockout mice. STAT6 is essential for the development of AA macrophages. Infection of the double-knockout mice displayed a lack of lung disease and prefibrotic lesions, suggesting that AA macrophage production may be the cause of STAT1-dependent lung disease. We propose that the control of AA macrophages by STAT1 is critical to regulating immune pathologies and for protection from long-term progression to fibrotic lung disease in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection.","Page, Carly; Goicochea, Lindsay; Matthews, Krystal; Zhang, Yong; Klover, Peter; Holtzman, Michael J; Hennighausen, Lothar; Frieman, Matthew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01689-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23015710/,36

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The aim of the current study was to evaluate P-wave dispersion (PWD) as a predictor of atrial fibrillation in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the PWD and inflammation parameters was investigated. METHODS A total of 140 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and 140 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. The risk of atrial fibrillation was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic PWD. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, neutrophil and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS PWD, white blood cell, NLR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between PWD and CRP level (rs = 0.510, P < 0.001) and NLR in COVID-19 group (rs = 0.302, P = 0.001). In their follow-up, 13 (9.3%) patients, 11 of whom were in the ICU, developed new atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION Our study showed for the first time in literature that the PWD, evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, was prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was found between PWD, CRP level and NLR. We believe that pretreatment evaluation of PWD in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting atrial fibrillation risk.","Yenerçağ, Mustafa; Arslan, Uğur; Şeker, Onur O; Dereli, Seçkin; Kaya, Ahmet; Doğduş, Mustafa; Öztürk, Çağatay E; Akpınar, Çetin K; Şen, Ahmet",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186236/,36
71809,"COVID-19, Naturally.",2020-09-01,"Background Expansion of telehealth is a high-priority strategic initiative for many health systems. Surgical clinics' implementation of video visits has been identified as a way to improve patient and provider experience. However, whether using video visits can reduce the cost of an outpatient visit is unknown. Methods Prospective case study using time-driven activity-based costing at two outpatient surgical clinics at an academic institution. We conducted stakeholder interviews and in-person observations to map outpatient clinic flow and measure resource utilization of four key steps: check-in, vitals collection and rooming, clinician encounter, and check-out. Finally, we calculated the resource cost for each step using representative salary information to calculate total visit cost. Results Video visits did not systematically reduce the amount of time clinicians spent with patients. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] visit costs were as follows: traditional clinic visits, $26.84 ($10.13); physician-led video visits, $27.26 ($9.69); and physician assistant-led video visits, $9.86 ($2.76). There was no significant difference in the total cost associated with physician-led traditional clinic visits and video visits (P=0.89). However, physician assistant-led video visits were significantly lower cost than physician-led video visits (P<0.001). Conclusions Using physician-led video visits does not reduce the cost of outpatient surgical visits when compared to traditional clinic visits. However, the use of less expensive clinician resources for video visits (e.g., physician-assistants) may yield cost savings for clinics.","Portney, David S; Ved, Rohan; Nikolian, Vahagn; Wei, Andrea; Buchmueller, Tom; Killaly, Brad; Alam, Hasan B; Ellimoottil, Chad",mHealth,https://doi.org/10.21037/mhealth-20-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437830/,36

72205,How IvIg Can Mitigate Covid-19 Disease: A Symmetrical Immune Network Model.,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND Repairing large hiatal hernias using mesh has been shown to reduce recurrence. Drawbacks to mesh include added time to place and secure the prosthesis as well as complications such as esophageal erosion. We used a laparoscopic technique for repair of hiatal hernias (HH) >5cm, incorporating primary crural repair with onlay fixation of a synthetic polyglycolicacid:trimethylene carbonate (PGA:TMC) absorbable tissue reinforcement. The purpose of this report is to present short-term follow-up data. METHODS Patients with hiatal hernia types I-III and defects >5cm were included. Primary closure of the hernia defect was performed using interrupted nonpledgeted sutures, followed by PGA:TMC mesh onlay fixed with absorbable tacks. A fundoplication was then performed. Evaluation of patients was carried out at routine follow-up visits. Outcomes measured were symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or other symptoms suspicious for recurrence. Patients exhibiting these complaints underwent further evaluation including radiographic imaging and endoscopy. RESULTS Follow-up data were analyzed on 11 patients. Two patients were male; 9 were female. The mean age was 60 years. The mean length of follow-up was 13 months. There were no complications related to the mesh. One patient suffered from respiratory failure, one from gas bloat syndrome, and another had a superficial port-site infection. One patient developed a recurrent hiatal hernia. CONCLUSIONS In this small series, laparoscopic repair of hiatal hernias >5cm with onlay fixation of PGA:TMC tissue reinforcement has short-term outcomes with a reasonably low recurrence rate. However, due to the preliminary and nonrandomized nature of the data, no strong comparison can be made with other types of mesh repairs. Additional data collection is warranted.","Massullo, James M; Singh, Tejinder P; Dunnican, Ward J; Binetti, Brian R",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680812x13291597715943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22906331/,36

72473,2020 AAPM&R presidential plenary address: The notorious MSG.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The use of Onyx has become the mainstream for the treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous malformations, but the reported success for type I spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (sDAVFs) remains limited. We review our experience with Onyx and report its limitations in the treatment of spinal AVFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the Interventional Neuroradiology Procedure database at Washington University for cases of sDAVF embolization. Radiology reports were reviewed for fistula classification, treatment technique, and initial and follow-up results. Angiographic images were reviewed to confirm diagnosis, treatment, and penetration of embolisate into the draining vein. RESULTS With the use of Onyx, sDAVFs were obliterated in six of seven patients at the time of treatment. Follow-up angiography confirmed sDAVF obliteration in two patients, and recurrence in two cases. Two patients had no follow-up. One patient not cured at the time of treatment was treated surgically. Of the nine total treatments, Onyx successfully crossed the nidus into the draining vein in only four cases. Successful venous embolization was facilitated with positioning of the microcatheter to less than 5 mm from the nidus in three of the four cases. The use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) resulted in venous penetration in eight of 10 cases, and short term follow-up cure in seven of 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with Onyx for type I sDAVF embolization has been tempered by difficulty in achieving venous penetration and, consequently, a high rate of recurrence. For management of these fistulas, we favor NBCA or surgical treatment.","Blackburn, Spiros L; Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Ray, Wilson Z; Zipfel, Gregory J; Cross, DeWitte T; Moran, Christopher J; Derdeyn, Colin P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943815/,36
72735,Psychosocial Reactions to Plagues in the Cultural History of Medicine: A Medical Humanities Approach.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND China is ranked 42nd on the Global Terrorism Index (2019), a scoring system of terrorist activities. While China has a relatively low terrorism risk, events globally have wide-ranging repercussions for future attacks, putting first responders and emergency health workers at risk. This study aims to provide the epidemiological context for the past decade detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter and to develop training programs utilizing these data. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in China between the years 2008-2018. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD's Codebook. Ambiguous events, as defined by the GTD's Codebook, were excluded. English language grey literature was searched to ensure no events meeting these criteria were missed. A focused search of online English language newspaper articles was also performed for any terrorist events between 2008-2018. RESULTS One-hundred and eight terrorist events occurred in the study time period. Of the 108 incidents, forty-seven (43.5%) involved Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite (E/B/D) only, with an average fatality count of 2.9 and injury count of 7.5 per event. Twenty-seven (25.0%) used bladed or blunt weapons in melees with an average fatality count of 9.7 and an injury count of 8.8 per event. Five (4.6%) involved incendiary weapons with an average fatality count of 2.4 and an injury count of 7.2 per event. Two used only chemical weapons (1.8%) with no recorded deaths and an injury count of 27.0 per event. Two events had unknown weapon types (1.8%) with one recorded death and no injury count. One event used a firearm (0.9%) and led to one death and no injuries. One event used a vehicle (0.9%), which also led to one death and no recorded injuries. Twenty-three attacks used a mix of weapons (21.2%) with an average fatality count of 17.1 and an injury count of 12.0 per event. CONCLUSIONS One-hundred and eight terrorist attacks were recorded between 2008-2018 on Chinese soil using well-understood modalities. This resulted in a total of 809 recorded fatalities with 956 non-fatal injuries. The most commonly chosen methodology was E/B/D, followed by melees and the use of bladed weapons. Three events individually recorded a combined casualty toll of over 100 people.","Tin, Derrick; Hart, Alexander; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632358/,36
73359,Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 – present experiences,2020-12-31,"OBJECT This paper describes a consecutive series of skull base meningiomas resected using an endoscopic endonasal approach through various corridors at a single institution over 7 years. The impact of case selection and experience, the presence of a cortical cuff between the tumor and surrounding vessels, and brain edema on morbidity and rates of gross-total resection (GTR) were examined. METHODS A retrospective review of a series of 46 skull base meningiomas from a prospective database was conducted. The series of cases were divided by location: olfactory groove (n = 15), tuberculum and planum (n = 20), sellar/cavernous (n = 9) and petroclival (n = 2). Gross-total resection was never intended in the sellar/cavernous tumors, which generally invaded the cavernous sinus. Clinical charts, volumetric imaging, and pathology were reviewed to assess the extent of resection and complications. Cases were divided based on a time point in which surgical technique and case selection improved into Group 1 (surgery prior to June 2008; n = 21) and Group 2 (surgery after June 2008; n = 25) and into those with and without a cortical cuff and with and without brain edema. RESULTS Improved case selection had the greatest impact on extent of resection. For the entire cohort, rates of GTR went from 38% to 76% (p = 0.02), and for cases in which GTR was the intent, the rates went from 63% to 84% (not significant), which was mostly driven by the planum and tuberculum meningiomas, which went from 75% to 91.7 % (nonsignificant difference). The presence of a cortical cuff and brain edema had no impact on outcomes. There were 3 CSF leaks (6.5%) but all were in Group 1. Hence, CSF leak improved from 14.2% to 0% with surgical experience. Lessons learned for optimal case selection are discussed. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcome for endonasal endoscopic resection of skull base meningiomas depends mostly on careful case selection and surgical experience. Imaging criteria such as the presence of a cortical cuff or brain edema are less important.","Khan, Osaama H; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.7.focus14321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465040/,36
73401,Ventilation in the Dental Clinic: An Effective Measure to Control Droplets and Aerosols during the Coronavirus Pandemic and Beyond.,2020,"Phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIα) is an essential host cell factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. An N-terminally truncated 130-kDa form was used to reconstitute an in vitro biochemical lipid kinase assay that was optimized for small-molecule compound screening and identified potent and specific inhibitors. Cell culture studies with PI4KIIIα inhibitors demonstrated that the kinase activity was essential for HCV RNA replication. Two PI4KIIIα inhibitors were used to select cell lines harboring HCV replicon mutants with a 20-fold loss in sensitivity to the compounds. Reverse genetic mapping isolated an NS4B-NS5A segment that rescued HCV RNA replication in PIK4IIIα-deficient cells. HCV RNA replication occurs on specialized membranous webs, and this study with PIK4IIIα inhibitor-resistant mutants provides a genetic link between NS4B/NS5A functions and PI4-phosphate lipid metabolism. A comprehensive assessment of PI4KIIIα as a drug target included its evaluation for pharmacologic intervention in vivo through conditional transgenic murine lines that mimic target-specific inhibition in adult mice. Homozygotes that induce a knockout of the kinase domain or knock in a single amino acid substitution, kinase-defective PI4KIIIα, displayed a lethal phenotype with a fairly widespread mucosal epithelial degeneration of the gastrointestinal tract. This essential host physiologic role raises doubt about the pursuit of PI4KIIIα inhibitors for treatment of chronic HCV infection.","Vaillancourt, Frédéric H; Brault, Martine; Pilote, Louise; Uyttersprot, Nathalie; Gaillard, Elias T; Stoltz, James H; Knight, Brian L; Pantages, Lynn; McFarland, Mary; Breitfelder, Steffen; Chiu, Tim T; Mahrouche, Louiza; Faucher, Anne-Marie; Cartier, Mireille; Cordingley, Michael G; Bethell, Richard C; Jiang, Huiping; White, Peter W; Kukolj, George",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01320-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22896614/,36
73498,Corneal densitometry patterns in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty and Descemet stripping automated keratoplasty.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Patients with severe stroke who require mechanical ventilation and neurointensive care unit (NICU) management often require a tracheostomy (TT). The optimal time point for TT remains unclear and a controversy in everyday NICU life. Here, we prospectively evaluated a score for prediction of TT need in NICU patients with cerebrovascular disease. METHODS Seventy-five consecutively ventilated stroke patients were prospectively included in the study and assessed by the stroke-related early tracheostomy score (SETscore) within the first 24 h of admission. Endpoints were TT need, NICU-length of stay (NICU-LOS), and ventilation time (VT). We examined the correlation of these variables with the SETscore using regression analysis and determined a cut-off by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS Twenty-six patients had to be tracheostomized. The mean VT was 8.7 ±8 days and the mean NICU-LOS was 11.6 ± 8 days. The SETscore predicted NICU-LOS with a positive predictive value of 0.748 (p < 0.001) and VT with a positive predictive value of 0.799 (p < 0.001). The ROC analysis demonstrated a SETscore value of 8 to be the optimal cut-off to predict prolonged NICU-LOS, VT, and TT need with a sensitivity of 64 % and a specificity of 86 %. CONCLUSIONS Based on this monocentric study, the SETscore seems to be a valid tool to indicate prolonged NICU-LOS and VT, as well as TT need in cerebrovascular NICU patients. Confirmation of these results in larger cohorts with various settings may help to develop the SETscore as a decisive tool on primary TT early in time to avoid extubation failure.","Schönenberger, Silvia; Al-Suwaidan, Faisal; Kieser, Meinhard; Uhlmann, Lorenz; Bösel, Julian",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-015-0235-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26842719/,36
73637,Prophylactic mesh use during primary stoma formation to prevent parastomal hernia.,2017,"Background: The impact of sex and gender in the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001. Conclusion: Our results indicate important sex-dependent differences in the diagnosis, clinical manifestation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. These results warrant further research to identify and close the gender gap in the ongoing pandemic.","Ancochea, Julio; Izquierdo, Jose L; Soriano, Joan B",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416429/,36

74217,Embodiment of sleep-related words: Evidence from event-related potentials.,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The avalanche of healthcare data is accelerating precision and personalized medicine. Artificial intelligence and algorithm-based approaches are becoming more and more vital to support clinical decision-making. These methods are able to augment health care providers by taking away some of their routine work and enabling them to focus on critical issues. However, few studies have used predictive modeling to uncover associations between comorbidities in ICU patients and diabetes. This study aimed to use Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) resources, involving machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to predict the risk of mortality. METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) data. Different machine learning modeling and NLP approaches were applied. Domain knowledge in health care is built on the dictionaries created by experts who defined the clinical terminologies such as medications or clinical symptoms. This knowledge is valuable to identify information from text notes that assert a certain disease. Knowledge-guided models can automatically extract knowledge from clinical notes or biomedical literature that contains conceptual entities and relationships among these various concepts. Mortality classification was based on the combination of knowledge-guided features and rules. UMLS entity embedding and convolutional neural network (CNN) with word embeddings were applied. Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) with entity embeddings were utilized to build clinical text representations. RESULTS The best configuration of the employed machine learning models yielded a competitive AUC of 0.97. Machine learning models along with NLP of clinical notes are promising to assist health care providers to predict the risk of mortality of critically ill patients. CONCLUSION UMLS resources and clinical notes are powerful and important tools to predict mortality in diabetic patients in the critical care setting. The knowledge-guided CNN model is effective (AUC = 0.97) for learning hidden features.","Ye, Jiancheng; Yao, Liang; Shen, Jiahong; Janarthanam, Rethavathi; Luo, Yuan",BMC medical informatics and decision making,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01318-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33380338/,36

The aim of the study is to quantify and determine the distribution of ghrelin cells in gastric mucosa in patients with morbid obesity and relate this finding to gender, comorbidities, gastritis, and plasmatic levels of acyl and desacylghrelin before and after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patient and Methods We performed a study on 61 patients with BMI≥50 kg/m2 operated by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Three gastric regions were analyzed by histopathology and immunohistology. Blood sample was taken before surgery, and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery, to study the plasma levels of ghrelin isoforms. Results Ghrelin cells are present in all regions of the gastric mucosa, with a greater number in the body and the fundus. Difference was found in the antrum between male and female patients (p=0.018). Patients with arterial hypertension also showed a lower level of cells in antrum (p<0.05). Acylghrelin levels after surgery were significantly lower (32.83+5.6 pg/mL to 10.09+11.8 pg/mL, p<0.05).

PURPOSE We describe the implementation of a pharmacist-provided pharmacogenomics (PGx) service in an executive health program (EHP) at an academic medical center. SUMMARY As interest in genomic testing grows, pharmacists have the opportunity to advance the use of PGx in EHPs, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. In November 2018, a pharmacist-provided PGx service was established in the EHP at the University of Colorado Hospital. The team members included 3 physicians, a pharmacist trained in PGx, a registered dietitian/exercise physiologist, a nurse, and 2 medical assistants. We conducted 4 preimplementation steps: (1) assessment of the patient population, (2) selection of a PGx test, (3) establishment of a visit structure, and (4) selection of a billing model. The PGx consultations involved two 1-hour visits. The first visit encompassed pretest PGx education, review of the patient's current medications and previous medication intolerances, and DNA sample collection for genotyping. After this visit, the pharmacist developed a therapeutic plan based on the PGx test results, discussed the results and plan with the physician, and created a personalized PGx report. At the second visit, the pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results, personalized the PGx report, and discussed the PGx-guided therapeutic plan with the patient. Overall, the strategy worked well; minor challenges included evaluation of gene-drug pairs with limited PGx evidence, communication of information to non-EHP providers, scheduling issues, and reimbursement. CONCLUSION The addition of a PGx service within an EHP was feasible and provided pharmacists the opportunity to lead PGx efforts and collaborate with physicians to expand the precision medicine footprint at an academic medical center.","Liko, Ina; Corbin, Lisa; Tobin, Eric; Aquilante, Christina L; Lee, Yee Ming",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33772264/,36
75383,Cochrane in 2017: Opportunities for the research community in China.,2018,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinicopathological prognostic factors, including surgical margin distance and tumor spread through air spaces (STAS), and recurrence after limited resection for primary lung cancer. METHODS We identified 508 cases of limited resection (12.8%) and examined their clinicopathological features. Using Cox regression analysis, we examined the significant prognostic factors for recurrence of limited resection. Finally, we conducted a histopathological evaluation of tumor STAS. RESULTS Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the risk for local recurrence was significantly associated with STAS (hazard ratio = 12.24, p = 0.001) and a tumor margin less than 1.0 cm (hazard ratio = 6.36, p = 0.02). However, the presence of tumor STAS was not significantly associated with distant recurrence (p = 0.98). This lack of association of STAS with distant recurrence may be due to the small number of distant recurrences. In all, 76 cases (15.0%) (60 adenocarcinomas, nine squamous cell carcinomas, and seven others) were positive for STAS. The morphological STAS patterns were 12 single cells, 45 small cell clusters, and 19 large nests. There was no significant relationship between the recurrence rate and morphological STAS pattern. The STAS-positive group was associated with the presence of micropapillary (p = 0.002) and/or solid components (p = 0.008) in patients with adenocarcinoma and with lymphovascular and pleural invasion (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of STAS and tumor margins less than 1.0 cm are significant risk factors for local recurrence in early-stage lung cancer after limited resection. Thus, the presence of tumor STAS might be a pathological prognostic factor for patients with lung cancer who have undergone limited resection. However, the pathological and molecular significance of STAS remain to be clarified.","Masai, Kyohei; Sakurai, Hiroyuki; Sukeda, Aoi; Suzuki, Shigeki; Asakura, Keisuke; Nakagawa, Kazuo; Asamura, Hisao; Watanabe, Shun-Ichi; Motoi, Noriko; Hiraoka, Nobuyoshi",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2017.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882585/,36

RESULTS The prioritization of quality received the highest mean score among the four factors of the scale (mean = 3.89, SD = 0.65), followed by supportive work environment (mean = 3.88, SD = 0.68), psychological safety (mean = 3.85, SD = 0.65), and improvement orientation (mean = 3.84, SD = 0.64). Nationality, clinical experience, and attendance to seminars or training were identified as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS The respondents perceived the infection prevention climate of the two general hospitals positively. This study strengthens the idea that organizational context influences negatively or positively the programs on infection prevention being implemented in the hospitals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The result may facilitate nursing and hospital management to reflect, examine, and review their organizational climate, the impact of infection prevention initiatives and patient safety strategies, and the reason to amend related policies or improve procedures, including the promotion of a healthy work environment.","Colet, Paolo C; Cruz, Jonas Preposi; Cacho, Gabby; Al-Qubeilat, Hikmet; Soriano, Shiela S; Cruz, Charlie P",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29193701/,36

The unpredictable onset and magnitude of COVID-19 infections resulted in wide gaps in preparedness for healthcare systems. The development of protocols to address both scarcity of resources and staff protection continues to be essential for risk mitigation. RECENT FINDINGS The northeast region of the United States had a rapid early surge of COVID-19 infections leading to the exhaustion of critical care capacity. In addition, northeastern hospitals experienced decrease in elective surgical interventions, including organ transplantation. Limited availability of COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment further fueled the pandemic. This commentary highlights a comprehensive innovative approach to addressing the operating room and hospital demands, as well as the shortages in resources and staffing during the pandemic. SUMMARY The VCU Department of Anesthesiology operated at 40% of its regular operating room volume throughout the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increased demand from emergency cases. The delay in the peak surge allowed Virginia Commonwealth University, Department of Anesthesiology to develop a comprehensive infrastructure resulting in resulting is maximal workforce risk mitigation.","Coombs, Alice A Tolbert; Lawson, Tamara; Daniel, Ronsard; Kim, Christin; Rashid, Megan M",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337671/,36

The focus on elective cesarean section compared to planned vaginal birth beginning in spontaneous labor is an improved methodology over the earlier comparisons that failed to be able to separate planned from unplanned cesarean section or vaginal birth. The retrospective case control methodology based on birth record data that is employed in this research is similar to others, though with more respectable numbers. Most suffer from the problem of ascertainment difficulties, failure to stratify by parity, and of course, the unavailability of randomization, which some consider the ideal methodology.","Klein, Michael C",Birth,https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635469/,36
77168,[Involvement of the complement cascade in severe forms of COVID-19].,2021-04-09,"Cells are continuously sensing their microenvironment and subsequently respond to different physicochemical cues by the activation or inhibition of different signaling pathways. To study a very complex cellular response, it is necessary to diminish background environmental influences and highlight the particular event. However, surface-driven nonspecific interactions of the abundant biomolecules from the environment influence the targeted cell response significantly. Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation may serve as a marker of human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cell responses to the extracellular matrix and surface-mediated stresses. Here, we propose a platform of tunable functionable antifouling poly(carboxybetain) (pCB)-based brushes to achieve a molecularly clean background for studying arginine, glycine, and aspartic acid (RGD)-induced YAP-connected mechanotransduction. Using two different sets of RGD-functionalized zwitterionic antifouling coatings with varying compositions of the antifouling layer, a clear correlation of YAP distribution with RGD functionalization concentrations was observed. On the other hand, commonly used surface passivation by the oligo(ethylene glycol)-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) shows no potential to induce dependency of the YAP distribution on RGD concentrations. The results indicate that the antifouling background is a crucial component of surface-based cellular response studies, and pCB-based zwitterionic antifouling brush architectures may serve as a potential next-generation easily functionable surface platform for the monitoring and quantification of cellular processes.","Víšová, Ivana; Smolková, Barbora; Uzhytchak, Mariia; Vrabcová, Markéta; Chafai, Djamel Eddine; Houska, Milan; Pastucha, Matěj; Skládal, Petr; Farka, Zdeněk; Dejneka, Alexandr; Vaisocherová-Lísalová, Hana",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10081146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764330/,36

The causative agent, Neoparamoeba perurans, induces a marked proliferation of the gill mucosa and focal superficial necrosis upon branchial lesions. The effect that amoebic branchialitis has upon gill associated commensal bacteria is unknown. A 16S rRNA sequencing approach was employed to profile changes in bacterial community composition, within amoebic gill disease (AGD)-affected and non-affected gill tissue. The bacterial diversity of biopsies with and without diseased tissue was significantly lower in the AGD-affected fish compared to uninfected fish. Furthermore, within the AGD-affected tissue, lesions appeared to contain a significantly higher abundance of the Flavobacterium, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi compared to adjunct unaffected tissues. Quantitative PCR specific to both N. perurans and T. dicentrarchi was used to further examine the co-abundance of these known fish pathogens. A moderate positive correlation between these pathogens was observed. Taken together, the present study sheds new light on the complex interaction between the host, parasite and bacterial communities during AGD progression. The role that T. dicentrarchi may play in this complex relationship requires further investigation.","Slinger, Joel; Adams, Mark B; Wynne, James W",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764238/,36

This Contemporary Review aims to 1) quantify podcast availability and episode frequency for medical learners across a broad range of specialties, and 2) compare these metrics between otolaryngology-specific podcasts with those of other specialties. DATA SOURCES Top five podcast platforms: Spotify (Stockholm, Sweden 2006), Apple Podcasts (Cupertino, CA 2012), Google Podcasts (Mountain View, CA 2018), Stitcher (San Francisco, CA 2008), and TuneIn (San Francisco, CA 2002). METHODS The selected podcast platforms were queried with a comprehensive set of keywords and manually searched for medically-relevant podcasts. Specialty, content, and number of episodes annually for the last 10 years were recorded for each podcast. RESULTS Otolaryngology has a comparable number of podcasts and breakdown of podcast category compared to other specialties, but reduced total episodes and episode frequency compared to other specialties. This may limit otolaryngologists' ability to engage in this validated form of medical education. CONCLUSIONS Podcast-based education provides a valuable resource for medical professionals to reinforce learning, broaden general knowledge base, and stay updated on current literature, particularly in light of increased demand for mobile and on-demand learning options. There is room for an increased number of podcasts and, particularly, increased episode frequency within the field of otolaryngology to extend these benefits to otolaryngologists and otolaryngologists in training.

In most European Union member states specialized isolation facilities are responsible for the management of such cases. Ground ambulances are often affiliated with those facilities because rapid relocation of patients is most desirable. To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the 'European Network for HIDs' conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated and feedback rates ranged from 78% to 100% (n = 37 to n = 48 centres). Only 46.8% (22/47) of all centres have both national and local guidelines regulating HID patient transport. If recommended, specific equipment is found in 90% of centres (9/10), but standard ambulances in only 6/13 centres (46%). Exclusive entrances (32/45; 71%) and pathways (30/44; 68.2%) for patient admission, as well as protocols for disinfection of ambulances (34/47; 72.3%) and equipment (30/43; 69.8%) exist in most centres. In conclusion, the availability and technical specifications of ambulances broadly differ, reflecting different preparedness levels within the European Union. Hence, regulations for technical specifications and operational procedures should be harmonized to promote patient and healthcare worker safety.","Schilling, S; Maltezou, H C; Fusco, F M; De Iaco, G; Brodt, H-R; Bannister, B; Brouqui, P; Carson, G; Puro, V; Gottschalk, R; Ippolito, G",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750421/,36

These recommendations relied, however, upon a limited set of competencies and a relatively narrow view of the physician's role. There have been increasing calls and recommendations to expand those competencies and the professional identity of the physician to better meet the current and future needs of patients, health systems, and society. We propose a framework for the twenty-first century physician that includes an expectation of new competency in health systems science (HSS), creating 'system citizens' who are effective stewards of the health care system. Experiential educational strategies, in addition to knowledge-centered learning, are critically important for students to develop their professional identity as system citizens working alongside interprofessional colleagues. Challenges to HSS adoption range from competing priorities for learners, to the need for faculty development, to the necessity for buy-in by medical schools and their associated health care systems. Ultimately, success will depend on our ability to articulate, encourage, support, and evaluate system citizenship and its impact on health care and health care systems.","Borkan, Jeffrey M; Hammoud, Maya M; Nelson, Elizabeth; Oyler, Julie; Lawson, Luan; Starr, Stephanie R; Gonzalo, Jed D",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1924366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291713/,36

Endoscopic management via the conventional route with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is quite limited due to the altered anatomy. Laparoscopic-assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP) via the excluded stomach has been highly successful. Reported use of laparoscopic-assisted EUS (LA-EUS) is extremely rare. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted at two tertiary referral centers for cases that involved laparoscopic-assisted ERCP and EUS. Patient demographic data were collected along with data regarding procedure, indication, complications and length of stay. RESULTS A total of 16 cases involving 15 patients were identified: 11 cases of LA-ERCP and five cases of combined LA-EUS plus LA-ERCP were performed. Four patients had previously undergone failed endoscopy via the conventional route (27 %). There was a 100 % biliary/pancreatic cannulation and intervention rate. There were no endoscopic-related complications. Therapeutic interventions included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, lysis of adhesions, biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy, biliary and pancreatic stent placement, stone removal including mechanical lithotripsy and EUS biopsy and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Average discharge was on postoperative day 3.4. However, 50 % were discharged after 1 day.

The existing DLBCs allow the delivery of self-expandable stents but do not offer the possibility to deploy flow-diverters. Despite the increasing use and success of flow-diverters, there have been numerous reports of procedural complications such as early in-stent thrombosis or delayed distal embolization. It seems that these complications can be avoided by correct stent positioning and adequate wall apposition, achieved either by manoeuvres with the microguidewire and/or microcatheter or by performing balloon angioplasty following an exchange guidewire manoeuvre. Objective Report the use of a new DLBC able to deliver a flow-diverter. Methods A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital with binocular horizontal diplopia for two weeks and reduced visual acuity. A left internal carotid artery aneurysm involving the cavernous and ophthalmic segments was found, with a maximum height of 19 mm and a broad 8 mm neck. It presented extra- and intra-dural components and the parent vessel was significantly narrowed. A decision was made to perform endovascular treatment of the aneurysm with placement of a flow diverter through a DLBC. Results Patency and adequate expansion of the flow diverter with evident intra-aneurysmal contrast stasis was observed in the final angiogram. No peri-procedural complications were observed. Conclusion This is a technical note demonstrating the feasibility of a new device to deploy a flow diverter, aiming to improve wall apposition and stent configuration without the need of additional devices or exchange manoeuvres.","Amorim, José M; Rosati, Santiago; Agid, Ronit; Pereira, Vítor Mendes; Krings, Timo","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917691238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28604183/,36
82719,The use of antineuropathic medications for the treatment of chronic pain.,2020-09-01,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a neuroinvasive virus that has been used as a model organism for studying common properties of all herpesviruses. HSV induces host organelle rearrangement and forms multiple, dispersed assembly compartments in epithelial cells, which complicates the study of HSV assembly. In this study, we show that HSV forms a visually distinct unitary cytoplasmic viral assembly center (cVAC) in both cancerous and primary neuronal cells that concentrates viral structural proteins and is a major site of capsid envelopment. The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such as Golgi- and recycling endosome-derived membranes. Lastly, we show that HSV cVAC formation and/or maintenance depends on an intact microtubule network and a viral tegument protein, pUL51. Our observations suggest that the neuronal cVAC is a uniquely useful model to study common herpesvirus assembly pathways, and cell-specific pathways for membrane reorganization.Importance Herpesvirus particles are complex and contain many different proteins that must come together in an organized and coordinated fashion. Many viruses solve this coordination problem by creating a specialized assembly factory in the host cell, and the formation of such factories provides a promising target for interfering with virus production. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects several types of cells, including neurons, but has not previously been shown to form such an organized factory in the non-neuronal cells in which its assembly has been best studied. Here we show that HSV-1 forms an organized assembly factory in neuronal cells, and we identify some of the viral and host cell factors that are important for its formation.","White, Shaowen; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Harata, N Charles; Roller, Richard J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00900-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699089/,36

However, there is concern that cure rates may be lower, and reinfection rates higher, among people who inject drugs. We conducted a systematic review of treatment outcomes achieved with DAAs in people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS A search strategy was used to identify studies that reported sustained viral response (SVR), treatment discontinuation, adherence or reinfection in recent PWID and/or opioid substitution therapy (OST) recipients. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis of proportions was used to estimate pooled SVR and treatment discontinuation rates. The pooled relative risk of achieving SVR and pooled reinfection rate were calculated using generalized mixed effects linear models. RESULTS The search identified 8075 references; 26 were eligible for inclusion. The pooled SVR for recent PWID was 88% (95% CI, 83%-92%) and 91% (95% CI 88%-95%) for OST recipients. The relative risk of achieving SVR for recent PWID compared to non-recent PWID was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.94-1.06). The pooled treatment discontinuation was 2% (95% CI, 1%-4%) for both recent PWID and OST recipients. Amongst recent PWID, the pooled incidence of reinfection was 1.94 per 100 person years (95% CI, 0.87-4.32). In OST recipients, the incidence of reinfection was 0.55 per 100 person years (95% CI, 0.17-1.76). CONCLUSIONS Treatment outcomes were similar in recent PWID compared to non-PWID treated with DAAs.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥18 years old admitted to 17 adult ICUs in Alberta, Canada from January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Data were obtained from a provincial clinical information system and data repository. The primary outcome was incidence of ICU death within 24 h of admission. Secondary outcomes were patient and system factors associated with early death. Variables of interest were identified a priori and examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Of 19,556 patients admitted to ICU in an 18-month period, 3.3% died within 24 h, representing 29.8% of ICU deaths. Factors associated with early death were age (adjusted-OR 0.99, 95% CI, 0.9-1.0), acuity (adjusted-OR 1.3, 95% CI, 1.3-1.4), admission from the Emergency Department (ED; adjusted-OR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-1.9) and surgical (adjusted-OR 2.27, 95% CI, 1.4-3.6), neurologic (adjusted-OR 4.6, 95% CI, 3.1-6.9) or trauma diagnosis (adjusted-OR 6.1, 95% CI, 2.4-15.6).

Here we present detection of fibroblast cell culture properties by nanocrystalline diamond solution-gated field-effect transistors (SG-FET), including effects of gamma irradiation. We show that blank nanocrystalline diamond field-effect biosensors are stable at least up to 300 Gy of γ irradiation. On the other hand, gate current of the diamond SG-FET biosensors with fibroblastic cells increases exponentially over an order of magnitude with increasing radiation dose. Extracellular matrix (ECM) formation is also detected and analyzed by correlation of electronic sensor data with optical, atomic force, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopies.","Krátká, Marie; Čermák, Jan; Vachelová, Jana; Davídková, Marie; Romanyuk, Nataliya; Kromka, Alexander; Rezek, Bohuslav","Colloids and surfaces.

87292,Managing breast gangrene during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection a global pandemic due to the fast transmission of this disease worldwide. To prevent and slow the transmission of this contagious illness, the public health officials of many affected countries scrambled to introduce measures aimed at controlling its spread. As a result, unprecedented interventions/measures, including strict contact tracing, quarantine of entire towns/cities, closing of borders and travel restrictions, have been implemented by most of the affected countries including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper is to share health care professionals' perspectives who are experiencing COVID19 firsthand in a foreign land. In addition, the role of the Saudi governance to combat the current situation is also discussed. DISCUSSION Personal and previous experiences as related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by the authors has been compared to the current situation and how it affected our thoughts and management. A review of the evidence-based literature was conducted to investigate the demographics of the region; and to understand the awareness of the various tools that are available and how they were utilized in the present situation of pandemic.

87605,Importance of Dermoscopy to Diagnose Vulvar Vestibular Papillomatosis vs. Warts.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mechanisms of both healing and complications, including spontaneous aneurysm rupture, remain unclear following flow diverter treatment. The aim of this study was to compare gene expression of various key molecules involved in the healing of aneurysms, between aneurysms treated with microcoils and flow diverters. METHODS Saccular aneurysms were created in rabbits. Aneurysms were treated with coils (n=6) or flow diverters (n=6). Aneurysms were harvested at 4 weeks following treatment and used for gene expression and zymography experiments. Genes with a fold change of 1.2 or more were considered upregulated whereas those with a fold change of 0.8 or less were considered downregulated. RESULTS All coil embolized aneurysms were completely occluded at follow-up. Two aneurysms were occluded and the remaining four samples were incompletely occluded in the flow diverter treated group. The following genes were expressed at lower levels in the flow diverter group compared with the coiled aneurysm group: proteinases (matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9), cellular markers (endothelial nitric oxide synthase and smooth muscle actin), and structural proteins (collagens and fibronectin). Genes related to inflammation (tumor necrosis factor α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) were upregulated in flow diverter treated aneurysms compared with coil embolized aneurysms. Notably, the enzymatic activity of active matrix metalloproteinase 9 was high in aneurysms treated with flow diverters. CONCLUSIONS Our findings may provide improved understanding of rupture risk and healing following aneurysm treatment and inform development of therapies aimed at lowering rupture risk and accelerating healing.","Puffer, Cole; Dai, Daying; Ding, Yong-Hong; Cebral, Juan; Kallmes, David; Kadirvel, Ramanathan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25332413/,36

We propose a hybrid optimization method to improve ANFIS performance, called PSOSMA, using a new modified meta-heuristics (MH) algorithm, Slime mould algorithm (SMA), which is improved by using the particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The proposed PSOSMA-ANFIS has been trained with air quality index time series data of three years and has been applied to forecast the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for one year. We also compared the proposed PSOSMA to other MH algorithms used to train ANFIS. We found that the modified ANFIS using PSOSMA achieved better performance than compared algorithms. Moreover, we analyzed the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan City on the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, CO2, and SO2. We compared the correspondence period with previous years, and we concluded that there are significant decreases in the concentrations of PM2.5, CO2, SO2, and NO2.","Al-Qaness, Mohammed A A; Fan, Hong; Ewees, Ahmed A; Yousri, Dalia; Elaziz, Mohammed Abd",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345891/,36

A large amount of data provides empirical evidence that there are overlaps of different types of addictive behaviors in etiology, phenomenology, and in the underlying psychological and biological mechanisms. Our aim was to investigate the co-occurrences of a wide range of substance use and behavioral addictions. Methods The present epidemiological analysis was carried out as part of the Psychological and Genetic Factors of the Addictive Behaviors (PGA) Study, where data were collected from 3,003 adolescents and young adults (42.6% males; mean age 21 years). Addictions to psychoactive substances and behaviors were rigorously assessed. Results Data is provided on lifetime occurrences of the assessed substance uses, their co-occurrences, the prevalence estimates of specific behavioral addictions, and co-occurrences of different substance use and potentially addictive behaviors. Associations were found between (i) smoking and problematic Internet use, exercising, eating disorders, and gambling (ii) alcohol consumption and problematic Internet use, problematic online gaming, gambling, and eating disorders, and (iii) cannabis use and problematic online gaming and gambling. Conclusions The results suggest a large overlap between the occurrence of these addictions and behaviors and underlies the importance of investigating the possible common psychological, genetic and neural pathways. These data further support concepts such as the Reward Deficiency Syndrome and the component model of addictions that propose a common phenomenological and etiological background of different addictive and related behaviors.","Kotyuk, Eszter; Magi, Anna; Eisinger, Andrea; Király, Orsolya; Vereczkei, Andrea; Barta, Csaba; Griffiths, Mark D; Székely, Anna; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Farkas, Judit; Kun, Bernadette; Badgaiyan, Rajendra D; Urbán, Róbert; Blum, Kenneth; Demetrovics, Zsolt",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609628/,36

It is important to find novel medications for RSV infection. A series of steroidal pyridines was synthesized for screening and evaluation of their antiviral activity, and investigation of their antiviral mechanism of action. Compound 3l had the highest antiviral activity, with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) of 3.13 μM. 3l was explored for its effects in vitro on RSV 2 hours before infection (pretreatment), at the time of infection (competition), and 2 hours after infection (postinfection). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I, interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-β were suppressed at the cellular level. Mouse lung tissue was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry, which showed that RSV antigen and M gene expression could be reduced by 3l. Decreased expression of TLR-3, RIG-I, IL-6, IFN-β and IL-10 was also found in vivo. The results indicated that compound 3l exerted its antiviral effects mainly through inhibition of viral replication and downregulation of inflammatory factors. This article is protected by copyright.

91053,Automated screening of COVID-19 preprints: can we help authors to improve transparency and reproducibility?,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic, and veterans are twice as likely to die from accidental overdose compared to non-veterans. This article describes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Rapid Naloxone Initiative, which aims to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans through (1) opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to VHA patients at risk for opioid overdose, (2) VA Police naloxone, and (3) select automated external defibrillator (AED) cabinet naloxone. METHODS VHA has taken a multifaceted, theory-based approach to ensuring the rapid availability of naloxone to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Strategies targeted at multiple levels (for example, patient, provider, health care system) have enabled synergies to speed diffusion of this lifesaving practice. RESULTS As of April 2021, 285,279 VHA patients had received naloxone from 31,730 unique prescribers, with 1,880 reported opioid overdose reversals with naloxone; 129 VHA facilities had equipped 3,552 VA Police officers with naloxone, with 136 reported opioid overdose reversals with VA Police naloxone; and 77 VHA facilities had equipped 1,095 AED cabinets with naloxone, with 10 reported opioid overdose reversals with AED cabinet naloxone. Remarkably, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on naloxone dispensing to VHA patients. CONCLUSION The VHA Rapid Naloxone Initiative saves lives. VHA is sharing many of the tools and resources it has developed to support uptake across other health care systems. Health care systems need to work together to combat this horrific epidemic within a pandemic and prevent a leading cause of accidental death (opioid overdose).","Oliva, Elizabeth M; Richardson, John; Harvey, Michael A; Bellino, Pamela",Joint Commission journal on quality and patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330409/,36

We document levels and predictors of U.S. parents who newly allowed adolescents to drink alcohol at home during the shutdown. METHODS Participants in an ongoing longitudinal study were two adolescent siblings (N = 911, M = 14.43, SD = 1.54 years) and one parent (N = 456; 85% mothers) who provided self-report data before the pandemic (T1) and during the shutdown. RESULTS No parents permitted adolescent drinking with family at T1; nearly one in six allowed it during the shutdown. In full models, adolescents who previously drank (without permission) and had light or heavy drinking parents were more likely to be newly permitted to drink. CONCLUSIONS Parents' alcohol permissibility within family contexts changed during the pandemic and was shaped by both parent and adolescent drinking.

APPROACH In 2019, a 3-year Clinic First project, called Clinic as Curriculum (CaC), was launched across the 4 family medicine residencies of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Minnesota Medical School. The department began publishing quarterly CaC dashboard data. Each clinic completed a baseline assessment of their performance on the 13 Building Blocks of High-Functioning Primary Care Residency Clinics. Using their baseline data, each clinic identified which block or blocks, in addition to the blocks on continuity of care and resident scheduling, to focus on. The plan is to collaboratively implement the overall and local goals using dashboard data and iterative process improvement over 3 years. OUTCOMES At baseline, clinics functioned quite well with respect to the 13 building blocks, but CaC dashboard data varied across the 4 clinics, with large variation between clinics on how frequently faculty were scheduled in the clinic and the proportion of total clinic visits seen by faculty. Resident continuity rates were low (range: 38%-47%). Level loading (consistent physician availability to meet patient demand) rates ranged from 1 to 11 days a month. Regarding resident schedules, 2 programs are moving from 4-week to 2-week inpatient blocks, and 2 programs are exploring longitudinal scheduling. One clinic will assign faculty and residents to specific clinic days. Two clinics are implementing microteams of 1 faculty and 3-4 residents. NEXT STEPS The authors plan to analyze the dashboard data longitudinally; explore microteams, team continuity, and team scheduling adherence; and develop and implement resident scheduling changes over the next 3 years.","Adam, Patricia; Hersch, Derek; Peek, C J",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039853/,36
93004,Monocortical mandibular bone grafting for reconstruction of alveolar cleft.,2010,"RATIONALE Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is a rare disease without standard treatments. Tripterygium wilfordii hook f (TwHF) is a traditional Chinese herb with anti-inflammatory effect, and 1.0 mg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides has been reported to significantly improve the disease activity of a SAPHO patient in a case report. However, the optimal dose of TwHF is still unclear. Here, we report the first case of SAPHO patient who achieved rapid remission in clinical symptoms after receiving 1.5 mg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS A 67-year-old woman noted palmoplantar pustulosis and pain in the anterior chest wall and waist. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated the typical tracer accumulation feature and magnetic resonance images showed bone marrow edema in lumbosacral vertebra. DIAGNOSES The diagnosis was made by dermatological and osteoarticular manifestations and classical signs in bone scintigraphy in accordance with the diagnostic criteria proposed in 2012. INTERVENTIONS Tripterygium glycosides was given with a primary dose of 1.5 mg/(kg·d) for 1 month and then reduced at a rate of 10 mg every 2 weeks until 1.0 mg/(kg·d) for a long-term maintenance. OUTCOMES Fast-induced remission on clinical manifestations was achieved and magnetic resonance imaging abnormality was improved significantly. Additionally, no apparent side effects were observed. LESSONS 1.5 mg/(kg·d) dose of Tripterygium glycosides seems to have fast-induced remission than 1.0 mg/(kg·d) with reliable safety. Besides, Tripterygium glycosides may also have a pharmacological effect of inhibiting osteolysis and enhancing bone strength.","Gong, Liang; Wang, Lun; Cao, Yihan; Li, Chen",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629743/,36

Due to the limited performance and context-dependence of riboswitches, only a few of them (such as theophylline, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin riboswitches) have been utilized as regulatory tools in biotechnology. In the present study, we demonstrated that a ribosome-dependent ribo-regulator, LRR, discovered in our previous work, exhibits an attractive regulatory performance. Specifically, it offers a 60-fold change in expression in the presence of retapamulin and a low level of leaky expression of about 1-2% without antibiotics. Moreover, LRR can be combined with different promoters and performs well in Bacillus thuringiensis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefac iens, and B. subtilis. Additionally, LRR also functions in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we demonstrate its ability to control melanin metabolism in B. thuringiensis BMB171. Our results show that LRR can be applied to regulate gene expression, construct genetic circuits and tune metabolic pathways, and has great potential for many applications in synthetic biology.","Cai, Xia; Wang, Qian; Fang, Yu; Yao, Die; Zhan, Yunda; An, Baoju; Yan, Bing; Cai, Jun",Microbial biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720523/,36

As a consequence, affected individuals can develop gross and microscopic bone malformations. The most common causes of rickets in domestic species include vitamin D and phosphorus deficiency. Rickets has been described in multiple species; however, comprehensive postmortem characterizations with confirmatory histopathology in equids have not been published. A 6-mo-old, Thoroughbred-cross foal was diagnosed with rickets based on gross autopsy findings and microscopic examination of the ribs and long bones. Grossly, all costochondral junctions of the ribs were enlarged with a ""rachitic rosary"" appearance, and there were multiple fracture calluses in the rib bodies. Epiphyses and metaphyses of the long bones appeared widened on sagittal section, and their physes were irregularly thickened. Histologically, there were poorly organized columns of hypertrophic chondrocytes within the physes of affected bones, islands of chondrocytes embedded within the primary and secondary spongiosa, and faintly eosinophilic seams of poorly mineralized osteoid within the bone trabeculae. Areas of focally increased osteoclastic activity were observed in some of the sections, perhaps pointing to a more complex metabolic bone disease in a growing animal. Low serum concentrations of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were detected in an antemortem sample. The pathogenesis of these imbalances was not definitively established, but lack of sunlight exposure, low concentration of vitamin D precursors in the diet (perhaps secondary to malnutrition), or both, were suspected; a genetic basis cannot be ruled out.","Asin, Javier; Murphy, Brian G; Samol, Monika A; Polanco, Jose; Moore, Janet D; Uzal, Francisco A","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/10406387211025232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160312/,36

The use of Permacol™ paste in the filling of anorectal fistula tract is a new sphincter-preserving method for fistula repair. The MASERATI100 study was a prospective, observational clinical study with the objective to assess the efficacy of Permacol™ collagen paste for anal fistula repair in 100 patients. METHOD Patients (N=100) with anal fistula were treated at ten European surgical sites with a sphincter-preserving technique using Permacol™ paste. Fistula healing was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being healing at 6 months. Faecal continence and patient satisfaction were surveyed at each follow-up; adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the follow-up. RESULTS At 6 months post-surgery, 56.7% of patients were healed, and the percentage healed was largely maintained, with 53.5% healed at 12 months. 29.0% of patients had at least one AE, and 16.0% of patients had one or more procedure-related AE. Most AEs reported were minor and similar to those commonly observed after fistula treatment, and the incidence of serious adverse events was low (4.0% of patients). Regardless of treatment outcome, 73.0% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure.

We review the latest achievements in genome research and their impact on medicine, primarily in the past decade. In most cases, genomic medicine tools remain in the realm of research, but some tools are crossing over into clinical application, where they have the potential to markedly alter the clinical care of patients. In this State of the Art Review, we highlight notable examples including the use of next-generation sequencing in cancer pharmacogenomics, in the diagnosis of rare disorders, and in the tracking of infectious disease outbreaks. We also discuss progress in dissecting the molecular basis of common diseases, the role of the host microbiome, the identification of drug response biomarkers, and the repurposing of drugs. The significant challenges of implementing genomic medicine are examined, along with the innovative solutions being sought. These challenges include the difficulty in establishing clinical validity and utility of tests, how to increase awareness and promote their uptake by clinicians, a changing regulatory and coverage landscape, the need for education, and addressing the ethical aspects of genomics for patients and society. Finally, we consider the future of genomics in medicine and offer a glimpse of the forces shaping genomic medicine, such as fundamental shifts in how we define disease, how medicine is delivered to patients, and how consumers are managing their own health and affecting change.","McCarthy, Jeanette J; McLeod, Howard L; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3005785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761042/,36

97134,Safe Delivery for COVID-19 Infected Pregnancies.,2020-03-26,"Mussels are widely used to monitor trace element pollution, but the role of their sex and sexual maturation in the element accumulation was not comprehensively studied and the number of elements under consideration never exceeded three dozen. In this work, concentrations of 67 elements in different tissues of females and males of the Mediterranean mussel are determined. Statistically significant differences are obtained in the element composition of analogous tissues of mussel males and females and in gonads of the same sex at different sexual maturation stages. The significantly higher concentrations of some elements found in gonads of females (Mn, Zn, As) and males (P) at most of the sexual maturation stages suggest essentiality of these elements in the reproduction. Elements exhibit several accumulation patterns in gonads during the ripening, with the most general one being the accumulation after spawning. Indications of a new phenomenon of circulation of most elements in gonads over the reproductive cycle are obtained, with the element concentrations decreasing at the first two stages and increasing at the posterior stages. Principal component analysis shows that the differences in the element accumulation are mainly due to the element uptake pathways and sexual differentiation. The most important identified factors determining the decrease in concentrations of tissue elements are their redistribution over mussel's body, biomass dilution, sequestration, and release with gametes. Five detected non-overlapping clusters of the non-normalized element concentrations in the pooled mussel tissues are associated with macroelements, two groups of trace elements, and two groups of ultratrace elements.","Kapranov, Sergey V; Karavantseva, Nadezhda V; Bobko, Nikolay I; Ryabushko, Vitaliy I; Kapranova, Larisa L",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12024-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411300/,36

To protect the public, regulators are encouraged to conduct restaurant inspections and disclose reports to consumers. However, inspection reporting format is inconsistent and typically contains information unclear to most consumers who often misinterpret the inspection results. Additionally, consumers are increasingly searching for this information in a digital context. Limited research explores inspection reports as communication tools. Using affect-as-information and ELM as theoretical frameworks, this experiment investigated how discrete emotions (e.g., disgust) conveyed through pictorial cues (i.e., emojis) influenced consumers' processing of inspection reports. Participants, recruited from Amazon's MTurk, were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions in a 3 (emoji: smiling vs. disgusted vs. none) x 2 (violation level: low vs. high) between-subjects design. Then, participants completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions and cognitive processing of the message. Results revealed that, compared to text, disgusted face emoji increased risk perceptions and avoidance behavior. In terms of emotion, smiling face emoji motivated participants to feel more emotions related to sanitation. In turn, positive feelings decreased elaboration likelihood. As predicted by ELM, involvement also predicted elaboration, such that participants who were highly involved with inspection reports elaborated more than those less involved. Involvement also moderated the relationship between emoji presented and elaboration. Practical implications are also discussed.","Ray, Elizabeth C; Merle, Patrick F",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1802867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806958/,36

The complexity of this form of ventilation is frequently underappreciated by the bedside clinician. In assisted mechanical ventilation, regardless of the specific mode, the ventilator's gas delivery pattern and the patient's breathing pattern must match near perfectly or asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator occurs. Asynchrony can be categorized into four general types: flow asynchrony; trigger asynchrony; cycle asynchrony; and mode asynchrony. In an article recently published in BMC Anesthesiology, Hodane et al. have demonstrated reduced asynchrony during assisted ventilation with Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) as compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV). These findings add to the growing volume of data indicating that modes of ventilation that provide proportional assistance to ventilation - e.g., NAVA and Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV) - markedly reduce asynchrony. As it becomes more accepted that the respiratory center of the patient in most circumstances is the most appropriate determinant of ventilatory pattern and as the negative outcome effects of patient-ventilator asynchrony become ever more recognized, we can expect NAVA and PAV to become the preferred modes of assisted ventilation!","Kacmarek, Robert M; Pirrone, Massimiliano; Berra, Lorenzo",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-015-0092-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215886/,36

97724,"How to classify the covid-19 phenotype: a response from ""the first soldier in the first trench"" in Lombardy, north-western Italy.",2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity in infancy worldwide, with cough and wheeze being alarming symptoms to parents. We aimed to analyze in detail the viral aetiology of ARI with such symptoms in otherwise healthy infants, including rhinoviruses and recently discovered viruses such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus (HBoV). METHODS We prospectively followed 197 unselected infants during their first year of life and assessed clinical symptoms by weekly standardized interviews. At the first ARI with cough or wheeze, we analyzed nasal swabs by sensitive individual real time polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16 different respiratory viruses. RESULTS All 112 infants who had an ARI had cough, and 39 (35%) had wheeze. One or more respiratory viruses were found in 88 of 112 (79%) cases. Fifteen (17%) dual and 3 (3%) triple infections were recorded. Rhino- (23% of all viruses) and coronaviruses (18%) were most common, followed by parainfluenza viruses (17%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (16%), HMPV (13%), and HBoV (5%). Together rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, HMPV, and HBoV accounted for 60% (65 of 109) of viruses. Although symptom scores and need for general practitioner (GP) consultations were highest in infants infected with RSV, they were similar in infants infected with other viruses. Viral shedding at 3 weeks occurred in 20% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, HMPV, and HBoV are common pathogens associated with respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy infants. They should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the aetiology of ARI in this age group.","Regamey, Nicolas; Kaiser, Laurent; Roiha, Hanna L; Deffernez, Christelle; Kuehni, Claudia E; Latzin, Philipp; Aebi, Christoph; Frey, Urs",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31815922c8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18174876/,36

Retrograde transfemoral AVR is usually performed during sedation, whereas antegrade transapical AVR is done with general anesthesia. Both procedures can be carried out without CPB. Extended hemodynamic monitoring, including pulmonary artery catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography, may be useful. Transfemoral AVR requires placement of a transvenous right ventricular pacing lead. Typical complications include local bleeding, obstruction of the coronary ostia, and neurological insult due to embolization of sclerotic material. Aortic regurgitation due to paravalvular leakage or inadequate device expansion also may occur. Renal function may deteriorate on excessive application of contrast medium. Atrioventricular blocks may occur later rather than after conventional AVR which tend to occur immediately.","Heinze, Hermann; Sier, Holger; Schäfer, Ulrich; Heringlake, Matthias",Journal of clinical anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2010.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20650387/,36

Indian patients with HNSCC are mostly associated with tobacco usage and may have different genetic alterations compared with Western patients who are mostly associated with human papillomavirus infection. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are correlated to individuals' susceptibility and progression of cancer. XRCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme. Materials and Methods In the present prospective study, Indian population of HNSCC patients (n = 45) were screened for Arg399Gln variant of XRCC1 using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, prospective evaluation of the patients was done after treatment, and the single-nucleotide polymorphism results were correlated to survival functions. Results Out of 45 patients, 28 patients were Arg/Arg, 12 patients were Arg/Gln, and 5 patients were Gln/Gln. Overall survival for the entire cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 36.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33-39.5), 38.6 (95% CI: 35.3-41.9), 35.8 (95% CI: 28.6-42.9), and 26.4 (95% CI: 13.7-39.1) months (P = 0.097), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) of the entire patient cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 35.2 (95% CI: 31.4-39.1), 38.2 (95% CI: 34.3-42.1), 32.7 (95% CI: 26.2-39.1), and 22.3 (95% CI: 9.4-35.3) (P = 0.061), respectively. Conclusions This study suggests that HNSCC patients with Gln substitution in place of Arg at position 399 (both homozygous and heterozygous) in XRCC1 protein have significantly inferior survival functions, higher recurrence rate, and events after radical treatment.","Dutta, Debnarayan; Abarna, Rajadurai; Shubham, Mehatre; Subbiah, Kannan; Duraisamy, Sriprakash; Chinnusamy, Rayappa; Anbalagan, Moorthy",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_476_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719266/,36

Methods: During the period from January 29 to March 30, 2020, a total of 344 COVID-19 patients were admitted to west branch of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were diagnosed with common type and excluded, and 34 patients were transferred to LeiShenShan or other medical units. The remaining 118 patients were severe cases, and 18 cases were excluded due to incomplete data. A total of 100 severe COVID-19 patients were finally collected. According to the outcome, the patients were divided into death group (37 cases) and survival group(63 cases), and the levels of serum CRP, ChE and PA were compared. Statistical analysis were performed by SPSS25.0. Results: There were 53 male patients in this study. The level of CRP in death group was significantly more elevated compare to the survival group [(95.72±39.56) mg/L vs. (22.21±20.75) mg/L, P<0.01]. On the contrary, serum ChE in death group was remarkably decreased [(5 082±1 566) U/L vs. (7 075±1 680) U/L, P<0.01]. Also, serum PA in death group was significantly lower [(86.18±47.94) mg/L vs. (167.40±57.82) mg/L, P<0.01]. Univariate analysis showed that CRP and PA had an impact on the survival of critical patients, but multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that CRP was the independent factor affecting the survival of critical patients. Conclusions: CRP is generally elevated in severe patients with COVID-19, and serum ChE and PA accordingly decrease. CRP and PA have influence on patients' survival, but only CRP demonstrates predictive value for prognosis in critical patients with COVID-19.","Wang, H; Hu, L; Bai, G Q; Liu, Z; Yu, G G; Wang, W; Sun, L",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200421-00404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503724/,36

The goal of this study is to examine variation in hospital utilization and site of death for patients dying with poor-prognosis cancer in the Regione Emilia-Romagna (RER), Italy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, population-level study using administrative data. Patients were included if they died in 2012 and had at least one hospital admission for metastatic or poor-prognosis cancer within 180 days of death. Variations in the use of the hospital, intensive care, and procedures performed were evaluated. RESULTS 11,470 patients died with metastatic or poor-prognosis cancer in 2012. Seventy-eight percent of patients were hospitalized in the last month of life while 50.7% of patients died in the hospital. Results varied by local health authority from 38.3% to 69.3%. Of patients who had an ICU stay, 55.1% in the community hospitals and 59.8% in the teaching hospitals were admitted to the ICU on the day of death or the day before death. 7.5% of patients underwent a major procedure in the last 30 days of life. CONCLUSIONS The overall high rate, and substantial variation, in hospital care at the end of life offers the RER the opportunity to evaluate if increasing availability of palliative care, along with provider and patient education, could reduce utilization of high-cost hospital care and increase patient and family satisfaction.","Louis, Daniel Z; Hegarty, Sarah E; Leoni, Maurizio; De Palma, Rossana; Varga, Stefan; Melotti, Rita",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.5301/tj.5000544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514312/,36

METHODS Between 2007 and 2010, 116 consecutive patients (mean age 69.6 years; 56 men) with symptomatic femoropopliteal stenoses were treated with directional atherectomy at a single center. All patients had claudication and TASC A/B lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. Histopathology analysis of atherectomy specimens was performed to identify adventitial injury. Clinical follow-up included physical examination and duplex ultrasound scans at 3, 6, and 12 months in all patients. The primary endpoint was the duplex-documented 1-year rate of restenosis, which was determined by a peak systolic velocity ratio <2.4. Patients were dichotomized by the presence or absence of adventitial or medial cuts as evaluated by histopathology. RESULTS Adventitial injury were identified in 62 (53%) of patients. There were no differences in baseline demographic and clinical features (p>0.05), lesion length (58.7±12.8 vs 56.2±13.6 mm, p=0.40), or vessel runoff (1.9±0.6 vs 2.0±0.6, p=0.37) between patients with and without adventitial injury, respectively. The overall 1-year incidence of restenosis was 57%, but the rate was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in patients with adventitial or medial injury (97%, 60/62) as compared with those without (11%, 6/54). CONCLUSION Lack of adventitial injury after atherectomy for femoropopliteal stenosis is strongly related to patency at 1 year.","Tarricone, Arthur; Ali, Ziad; Rajamanickam, Anitha; Gujja, Karthik; Kapur, Vishal; Purushothaman, K-Raman; Purushothaman, Meerarani; Vasquez, Miguel; Zalewski, Adrian; Parides, Micheal; Overbey, Jessica; Wiley, Jose; Krishnan, Prakash",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815597683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208657/,36
101190,The Potential Role of Radiogenomics in Precision Medicine for COVID-19.,2021-03-24,"UNLABELLED Passengers in an aircraft cabin can have different risks of infection from airborne infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) because of the non-uniform airflow in an aircraft cabin. The current investigation presents a comprehensive approach to assessing the spatial and temporal distributions of airborne infection risk in an aircraft cabin. A case of influenza outbreak was evaluated in a 4-h flight in a twin-aisle, fully occupied aircraft cabin with the index passenger seated at the center of the cabin. The approach considered the characteristics of the exhalation of the droplets carrying infectious agents from the index passenger, the dispersion of these droplets, and the inhalation of the droplets by susceptible passengers. Deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to quantify the risks based on the amount of inhaled influenza virus RNA particles and quanta, respectively. The probabilistic approach indicated that the number of secondary infection cases can be reduced from 3 to 0 and 20 to 11, for influenza cases if N95 respirator masks are used by the passengers. The approach and methods developed can easily be implemented in other enclosed spaces such as buildings, trains, and buses to assess the infection risk. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Airborne infectious disease transmission could take place in enclosed environments such as buildings and transport vehicles. The infection risk is difficult to estimate, and very few mitigation methods are available. This study used a 4-h flight as an example in analyzing the infection risk from influenza and in mitigating the risk with an N95 mask. The results will be useful to the airline industry in providing necessary protection to passengers and crew, and the results can also be used for other enclosed spaces.","Gupta, Jitendra K; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Chen, Qingyan",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2012.00773.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22313168/,36

The main processes governing CE can be explained by considering hard/soft acid/base theory, but the detailed mechanism of CE, however, has been debated and has been attributed to both diffusion and vacancy processes. In this work, we have performed in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy to further understand the mechanism of the CE of copper in solution phase CdSe NCs. The x-ray data indicates clear isosbestic points, suggestive of cooperative behavior as previously observed via optical spectroscopy. Examination of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure data points to the observation of interstitial impurities during the initial stages of CE, suggesting the diffusion process is the fundamental mechanism of CE in this system.","Khammang, Alex; Wright, Joshua T; Meulenberg, Robert W",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20712-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469012/,36

We compared effectiveness of CAS versus CEA among Medicare beneficiaries. METHODS AND RESULTS We linked Medicare data (2000-2009) to the Society for Vascular Surgery's Vascular Registry (2005-2008) and the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's (NCDR) Carotid Artery Revascularization and Endarterectomy Registry (2006-2008/2009). Medicare patients were followed up from procedure date until death, stroke/transient ischemic attack, periprocedural myocardial infarction, or a composite end point for these outcomes. We derived high-dimensional propensity scores using registry and Medicare data to control for patient factors and adjusted for provider factors in a Cox regression model comparing CAS with CEA. Among 5254 Society for Vascular Surgery's Vascular Registry (1999 CAS; 3255 CEA) and 4055 Carotid Artery Revascularization and Endarterectomy Registry (2824 CAS; 1231 CEA) Medicare patients, CAS patients had a higher comorbidity burden and were more likely to be at high surgical risk (Society for Vascular Surgery's Vascular Registry: 96.7% versus 44.5%; Carotid Artery Revascularization and Endarterectomy Registry: 71.3% versus 44.7%). Unadjusted outcome risks were higher for CAS. Mortality risks remained elevated for CAS after adjusting for patient-level factors (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.46). After further adjustment for provider factors, differences between CAS and CEA were attenuated or no longer present (hazard ratio for mortality, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.37).

103158,New Insights for the Pathogenesis of COVID-19-Related Dysgeusia.,2020-06-12,"Aquatic birds are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs). These viruses can infect humans repeatedly and cause acute respiratory disease with potential of spread in the form of epidemics. In addition, avian influenza viruses that overcome the interspecies barrier and adapt to humans can cause a world-wide pandemic with severe consequences to human health. Therefore, scientists are focused on the development of a ""universal"" vaccine with a broad protective efficacy, i.e. against different subtypes of influenza A viruses and not only against the currently co-circulating human epidemic strains. Nowadays, several new vaccine design strategies have been described. Most of them utilize the conserved stem part of influenza surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) or the ectodomain of M2 (M2e) protein with proton- channel activity. A comparison of the effectivity of novel vaccines and their protective mechanisms against influenza infection is discussed in this review and should be considered for the construction of the most effective broadly protective vaccine with minimal side effects. This is the essential goal in influenza virus research today, especially when the infection with new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can interfere with the course of influenza virus infection.

104079,Delaying Cancer Cases in Urology during COVID-19: Review of the Literature.,2020-07-17,"PURPOSE We aimed to define intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycle characteristics associated with viable birth, identify thresholds below which IUI treatments are consistent with very poor prognosis and futile care, and develop a nomogram for individualized application. METHODS This retrospective cohort study evaluated couples using fresh partner ejaculate for IUI from January 2005 to September 2017. Variables included female age, semen characteristics, and ovarian stimulation type. Using cycle-level data, we evaluated the association of these characteristics with the probability of viable birth by fitting generalized regression models for a binary outcome with a logit link function, using generalized estimating equation methodology to account for the correlation between cycles involving the same patient. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 1117 women with 2912 IUI cycles; viable birth was achieved in 275 (9.4%) cycles. Futile care (viable birth rate < 1%) was identified for women age > 43, regardless of stimulation type or inseminate motility (IM). Very poor prognosis (viable birth rate < 5%) was identified for women using oral medications or Clomid plus gonadotropins who were (1) age < 35 with IM < 49%, (2) age 35-37 with IM < 56%, or (3) age ≥ 38, and (4) women age ≥ 38 using gonadotropins only with IM < 60%. A clinical prediction model and nomogram was developed with an optimism-corrected c-statistic of 0.611. CONCLUSIONS The present study highlights the impact of multiple clinical factors on IUI success, identifies criteria consistent with very poor prognosis and futile care, and provides a nomogram to individualize counseling regarding the probability of a viable birth.","Ainsworth, Alessandra J; Barnard, Emily P; Baumgarten, Sarah C; Weaver, Amy L; Khan, Zaraq",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01918-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803421/,36

This included evaluating effectiveness of MI interventions within this population and reporting the methodology used, including theoretical underpinnings and identification of BC and MI techniques. Eight databases were searched using controlled vocabulary. Eligible studies included adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ), author-reported interventions using MI aiming to reduce body weight or BMI, and comparator groups not receiving an MI intervention. Data extraction and quality appraisal tools were used to identify study characteristics, intervention content was coded for techniques, and random-effects meta-analysis were conducted to investigate effects. Meta-analysis of 12 studies indicated no overall pooled effect on bodyweight and BMI outcomes between intervention and control groups (SMD = -0.01 [95%CI -0.13 to 0.12, P = .93]). Findings were limited by multiple sources accounting for risk of bias, and poor reporting of intervention fidelity and content. Intervention and control content descriptions indicated similar techniques, with social support, goal setting (behaviour) and self-monitoring of behaviour occurring most frequently across both. Findings do not contribute additional evidence for MI use in this context, however methodological limitations were identified which must be resolved to better identify the intervention effects on obesity-related outcomes.","Makin, Harriet; Chisholm, Anna; Fallon, Victoria; Goodwin, Laura",Clinical obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955152/,36

She complained of blurred vision in the left eye (2/60) and was subsequently found to have a left choroidal metastasis. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib was started, and after 1 year of disease stability, she developed unsteadiness and worsening visual disturbance (1/60). Brain imaging showed 24 new brain metastases, which were treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery. An enlarging axillary lymph node was biopsied, which identified the T790M mutation, and she commenced the novel TKI osimertinib. Three weeks later, her choroidal lesion had regressed from 3.1 mm to 2.2 mm, and after 2 months of osimertinib, her visual acuity had improved to 6/9. At the last follow-up 8 months after initiation of osimertinib, her choroidal metastasis remains stable, and visual acuity has improved to 6/6. Evidence suggests that osimertinib's efficacy in treating cerebral metastases is superior to that of chemotherapy and other EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib); however, the literature is sparse with regards to the use of osimertinib for the treatment of intraocular disease. In this case, the need for intense daily radiation treatment with its associated toxicities was negated, and as such we propose that osimertinib may be a promising treatment for choroidal metastasis secondary to EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.","Keshwani, Karim; Roelofs, Kelsey A; Hay, Gordon; Lewis, Rachel; Plowman, Nick",Ocular oncology and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796513/,36

To update prevalence estimates for self-reported hypertension and use of antihypertensive medication, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The overall (unadjusted) prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 32.1%-32.7%). The age-standardized, median state-specific prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 29.7% (range = 24.3%-38.6%). Overall age-standardized hypertension prevalence was higher among men (32.9%) than among women (27.0%), highest among blacks (40.0%), decreased with increasing levels of education and household income, and was generally highest in the Southeastern and Appalachian states.* Among persons reporting hypertension, the overall unadjusted prevalence of self-reported antihypertensive medication use was 76.0% (95% CI = 75.5%-76.4%).

Not known is the extent to which rest-activity rhythms (RAR) may be related to biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in this population. In this cross-sectional, observational study, 52 healthy emerging adults wore wrist accelerometers (14 consecutive days; 24 h/day) for assessment of nonparametric RAR metrics, including interdaily stability (IS; day-to-day RAR consistency), intradaily variability (IV; within-day RAR fragmentation), and relative amplitude (RA; robustness of RAR), as well as autocorrelation (correlation of rest/activity levels at 24-h lag-times). Cardiometabolic biomarkers, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, blood pressure (BP), fasting lipids, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed. Additional measures including physical activity, sleep duration, and habitual caffeine and alcohol consumption were also evaluated. A series of multivariable regression models of cardiometabolic biomarkers were used to quantify associations with RAR metrics. On average, participants were 20 ± 1 years of age (21 males, 31 females), non-obese, and non-hypertensive. All were nonsmokers and free of major diseases or conditions. In separate models, which adjusted for sex, BMI, moderate-vigorous physical activity, sleep duration, caffeine, and alcohol consumption, IS was inversely associated with total cholesterol (p ≤ 0.01) and non-HDL cholesterol (p < .05), IV was positively associated with CRP (p < .05), and autocorrelation was inversely associated with total cholesterol (p < .05) and CRP (p < .05). Conversely, associations between RA and cardiometabolic biomarkers were nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI, alcohol, and caffeine consumption. In conclusion, RAR metrics, namely, a higher IS, lower IV, and higher autocorrelation, emerged as novel biomarkers associated with more favorable indices of cardiometabolic health in this sample of apparently healthy emerging adults.","Hoopes, Elissa K; Witman, Melissa A; D'Agata, Michele N; Berube, Felicia R; Brewer, Benjamin; Malone, Susan K; Grandner, Michael A; Patterson, Freda",Chronobiology international,https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1868490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435741/,36
106263,Digital biomarker-based individualized prognosis for people at risk of dementia.,2020,"Background Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common species causing invasive aspergillosis (IA), a life-threatening infection with more than 80% mortality. Interactions between A. fumigatus and human blood platelets lead to intravascular thrombosis and localized infarcts. To better understand A. fumigatus pathogenesis, we aimed to analyze the genetic basis of interactions between the pathogen and blood platelets. Methods A bioinformatic pipeline on microarray gene expression dataset, including analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Limma R package and their molecular function, as well as biological pathways identification, was conducted to find the effective genes involved in IA. In the wet phase, the gene expression patterns following fungal exposure to blood platelets at 15, 30, 60, and 180 min were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. Results Three genes encoding aspartic endopeptidases including (Pep1), (Asp f 13), and (β-glucanase) were the standing candidates. The invasion-promoting fungal proteinase-encoding genes were down-regulated after 30 min of hyphal incubation with blood platelets, and then up-regulated at 60 and 180 min, although only Pep1 was greater than the control at the 60and 180 min time points. Also, the same genes were downregulated in more the clinical isolates relative to the standard strain CBS 144.89. Conclusion Our findings delineate the possible induction of fungal-encoded proteinases by blood platelets. This provides a new research line into A. fumigatus' molecular pathogenesis. Such insight into IA pathogenesis might also guide researchers toward novel platelet-based therapies that involve molecular interventions, especially in IA patients.","Arghavan, Bahareh; Shafiee, Mohammad; Hashemi, Seyed Jamal; Khodavaisy, Sadegh; Hosseinkhan, Nazanin; Didehdar, Mojtaba; Getso, Muhammad; Ayatollahi, Aliasghar; Rezaie, Sassan",Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.52547/rbmb.10.1.95; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277873/,36

The above concepts overlap and relate to the atherogenic process and development of type 2 diabetes. However, there is confusion about what these terms mean and how they can best be used to improve our understanding of cardiovascular disease treatment and prevention. The concepts related to cardiometabolic risk, pathophysiology, and strategies for identification and management (including health behaviours, pharmacotherapy, and surgery) in the multiethnic Canadian population are presented. ""Global cardiometabolic risk"" is proposed as an umbrella term for a comprehensive list of existing and emerging factors that predict cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes. Health behaviour interventions (weight loss, physical activity, diet, smoking cessation) in people identified at high cardiometabolic risk are of critical importance given the emerging crisis of obesity and the consequent epidemic of type 2 diabetes. Vascular protective measures (health behaviours for all patients and pharmacotherapy in appropriate patients) are essential to reduce cardiometabolic risk, and there is growing consensus that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to adequately address cardiometabolic risk factors. Health care professionals must also consider ethnicity-related risk factors in order to appropriately evaluate all individuals in their diverse patient populations.","Leiter, Lawrence A; Fitchett, David H; Gilbert, Richard E; Gupta, Milan; Mancini, G B John; McFarlane, Philip A; Ross, Robert; Teoh, Hwee; Verma, Subodh; Anand, Sonia; Camelon, Kathryn; Chow, Chi-Ming; Cox, Jafna L; Després, Jean-Pierre; Genest, Jacques; Harris, Stewart B; Lau, David C W; Lewanczuk, Richard; Liu, Peter P; Lonn, Eva M; McPherson, Ruth; Poirier, Paul; Qaadri, Shafiq; Rabasa-Lhoret, Rémi; Rabkin, Simon W; Sharma, Arya M; Steele, Andrew W; Stone, James A; Tardif, Jean-Claude; Tobe, Sheldon; Ur, Ehud",The Canadian journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2011.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21459258/,36

Did Locke claim that some objects have powers that are unrelated to their natures or real essences? The question has split commentators. Some (Wilson, Stuart, Langton) claim the answer is yes and others (Ayers, Downing, Ott) claim the answer is no. This paper argues that both of these positions may be mistaken. I show that Locke embraced a robust epistemic humility. This epistemic humility includes ignorance of the real essences of bodies, of the causal processes underlying the production of natural phenomena, and of God's method of creation. I show how this epistemic humility offers strong support for an agnostic response to the question of superaddition. Locke did not intend to claim that bodies either do or do not have properties unrelated to their real essences. Instead, his primary goal in discussing the topic was to emphasize the strict limits to human knowledge.","Connolly, Patrick J",Studies in history and philosophy of science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26227231/,36

107635,COVID-19 and the Eye: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.,2021-01-01,"Nonstructural protein 3A of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a partially conserved protein of 153 amino acids in most FMDVs examined to date and plays important roles in virus replication, virulence and host range. To better understand the role of 3A during FMDV infection, we used coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to identify host proteins that interact with 3A in FMDV infected cells. Here we report that cellular vimentin is a host binding partner for 3A. The 3A-vimentin interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down and immunofluorescence assays. Alanine scanning mutagenesis indicated that amino acid residues 15-21 at the N-terminal region of the FMDV 3A are responsible for the interaction between 3A and vimentin. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrate that mutations in 3A that disrupt the interaction between 3A and vimentin are also critical for virus growth. Overexpression of vimentin significantly suppressed the replication of FMDV, whereas knockdown of vimentin significantly enhanced FMDV replication. However, chemical disruption of the vimentin network by acrylamide resulted in a significant decrease in viral yield, suggesting that an intact vimentin network is needed for FMDV replication. These results indicate that vimentin interacts with FMDV 3A and negatively regulate FMDV replication, and that the vimentin-3A interaction is essential for FMDV replication. This study provides information that should be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanism of FMDV replication.IMPORTANCE FMDV non-structural protein 3A plays important roles in virus replication, host range and virulence. To further understand the role of 3A during FMDV infection, identification of host cell factors that interact with FMDV 3A is needed. Here we found that vimentin is a direct binding partner of FMDV 3A, and manipulation of vimentin has a negatively effect on virus replication. We also demonstrated that amino acid residues 15-21 at the N-terminal region of the FMDV 3A are responsible for the interaction between 3A and vimentin and the 3A-vimentin interaction is critical for the viral replication since full-length cDNA clone harboring mutations in 3A, which were disrupt 3A-vimenin reactivity, could not produce viable virus progeny. This study provides information that not only provides us a better understanding of the mechanism of FMDV replication but also helps in the development of novel antiviral strategies in the future.","Ma, Xueqing; Ling, Ying; Li, Pinghua; Sun, Pu; Cao, Yimei; Bai, Xingwen; Li, Kun; Fu, Yuanfang; Zhang, Jing; Li, Dong; Bao, Huifang; Chen, Yingli; Li, Zhiyong; Wang, Yonggang; Lu, Zengjun; Liu, Zaixin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00273-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493819/,36

However, a heart transplant (HT) after such support remains challenging. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the immediate and long-term results following an HT in the cohort of patients who had a TAH-t implant. METHODS A total of 73 patients were implanted with the TAH-t between 1988 and 2019 in our centre. Of these 73 consecutive patients, 50 (68%) received an HT and are included in this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. RESULTS In the selected cohort, in-hospital mortality after an HT was 10% (n = 5). The median intensive care unit stay was 33 days (range 5-278). The median hospital stay was 41 days (range 28-650). A partial or total pericardiectomy was performed during the HT procedure in 21 patients (42%) due to a severe pericardial reaction. Long-term survival rates after an HT at 5, 10 and 12 years were 79.1 ± 5.9% (n = 32), 76.5 ± 6.3% (n = 22) and 72.4 ± 7.1% (n = 12), respectively, which was similar to the long-term survival for a primary HT without TAH-t during the same period (n = 686). An HT performed within 3-6 months post-TAH-t implantation appeared to provide the best survival (P = 0.007). Eight (16%) patients required chronic dialysis during the subsequent follow-up period, with 3 patients requiring a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS The long-term outcomes with the SynCardia TAH-t as a bridge to transplant in patients with severe biventricular failure are very encouraging.

METHODS A systematic research was performed on the major international online databases; Thirty-five articles were selected. RESULTS A statistically significant reduction in testosterone levels and sperm quality in subjects with COVID-19 has been highlighted in several papers; however, in many cases the tests have been conducted in patients with active disease and long-term consequences are still not known. Some studies have confirmed the presence of the virus in the testis in a low percentage of patients; viral presence in sperm has only been found in one study. Testicular discomfort, which could indicate viral orchitis, was highlighted in several works, with an incidence of up to 19% percent of patients. The presence of inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates, IgG and inflammatory cytokines have been documented in several works; pathological signs of inflammation were found in 60.9% of testicular biopsies performed in one study. The entry of the virus into the testis cells, both stromal and seminal cells appeared to be Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) mediated, as it also occurs in other tissues. DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, autoantibody production and ACE2 mediated effect have all been hypothesized as cause of cellular damage. CONCLUSIONS The results on effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are currently insufficient as they are based on a small number of patients and therefore are often contradictory.Certain mechanisms of testicular damage are still to be assessed, as any risk categories like age, ethnicity, or others. As for the transmission of the virus through sperm, there is insufficient evidence to ensure that this cannot happen.","Delle Fave, Rocco Francesco; Polisini, Giordano; Giglioni, Gianluca; Parlavecchio, Arnaldo; Dell'Atti, Lucio; Galosi, Andrea Benedetto","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2021.1.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754623/,36

At least 10% will develop a proximal deep vein thrombosis in the first month and 1.5% a pulmonary embolus. Although hydration, antiplatelet treatment and early mobilisation may reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, there are currently no preventive strategies which have been clearly shown to be both effective and safe. Anticoagulation increases the risks of bleeding and compression stockings are ineffective. Systematic reviews of small randomized trials of intermittent pneumatic compression have shown that this reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery, but that there are few data concerning its use after stroke. The CLOTS trial 3 aims to determine whether, compared with best medical care, best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression in immobile stroke patients reduces the risk of proximal deep vein thrombosis. METHODS/DESIGN CLOTS Trial 3 is a parallel group multicentre trial; with centralized randomisation (minimisation) to ensure allocation concealment. Over 80 centres in the U.K. will recruit 2800 immobile stroke patients within the first 3 days of their hospital admission. Patients will be allocated to best medical care or best medical care plus intermittent pneumatic compression. Ultrasonographers will perform a Compression Duplex Ultrasound Scan to detect deep vein thrombosis in each treatment group at about 7-10 days and 25-30 days. The primary outcome cluster includes symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in the popliteal or femoral veins detected on either scan. Patients are then followed up by postal or telephone questionnaire at 6 months from randomisation to detect later symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and to establish their functional outcome (Oxford handicap scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-3 L). The ultrasonographers performing the scans are blinded to treatment allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are not. The trial has 90% power to detect a 4% absolute difference in risk of the primary outcome and includes a health economic analysis. DISCUSSION The trial started recruitment in Dec 2008 and will complete recruitment during 2012. It will report results in 2013.

METHODS a descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study conducted in two basic health units. Data collection included blood collection, nursing consultation and physical evaluation of 156 elderly subjects with chronic diseases. RESULTS the most prevalent intrinsic risk factors of NANDA-I were visual impairment (73.7%), impaired mobility (70.5%) and history of falls (69.9%); and extrinsic factors were the use of insufficient material in the bathroom (60.3%) and loose carpets (58.3%). The intrinsic factors that increased the risk for falls were the use of assistive devices (OR 3.50; p=0.030), impaired walking (OR 2.84; p=0.019) and cognitive impairment (OR 1.26; p=0.019); and the extrinsic factor was the use of loose rugs (OR 1.59; p=0.041). CONCLUSION this ND has proved to be a valuable instrument for the identification of risk factors for falls in elderly subjects in primary care.","Santos, Paulo Henrique Fernandes Dos; Stival, Marina Morato; Lima, Luciano Ramos de; Santos, Walterlânia Silva; Volpe, Cris Renata Grou; Rehem, Tania Cristina Morais Santa Barbara; Funghetto, Silvana Schwerz",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2018-0826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667409/,36

MATERIALS AND METHODS The institutional animal care and use committee approved the animal study. Thirty-two adult Japanese white rabbits were included in our study. Bone biopsy needles were inserted from the distal end of the right (RFA side) and the left (control side) femurs using a fluoroscopic guide. A 17-gauge internally cooled RFA electrode with a 2-cm active tip was inserted through the needle to the right femur, and RFA was performed for 12 min using a 200-W generator. Animals were divided into four groups and 8 animals from each group were euthanized on day 1, day 7, day 30, and day 60 after RFA. MRI was performed prior to euthanasia. Three-point bending test was performed to measure flexural strength. Student's t test was used to evaluate for significant differences between RFA and control side for each group. Femurs underwent histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin staining after the bending test. RESULTS MRI showed a high-intensity rim around the bone on T2WI. Three-point bending test showed no statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between the RFA and the control side in any of the groups. Histologically, osteocytes of cortical bone showed cell death, but the lamellar structure was preserved in all groups and bone remodeling was observed. CONCLUSION Heat by RFA did not change normal bone strength within 2 months, despite the heat effects in the cortical bone and cell death.","Yamamoto, Shuichi; Kaminou, Toshio; Ono, Yuichi; Hashimoto, Masayuki; Ohuchi, Yasufumi; Yoshida, Haruhiko; Ogawa, Toshihide",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-013-1807-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435712/,36
111150,"Bounding the Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, With Application to COVID-19 Antibody Tests.",2020-12-24,"PURPOSE The aim of the present study was to investigate the technical feasibility of flat-panel cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of very small (<1.5 cm) liver tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients included were candidates for hepatic percutaneous RFA as they had single biopsy-proven hepatic tumors sized ≤ 1.5 cm and poorly defined on ultrasonography. Following apnea induction, unenhanced CBCT scans were acquired and used to deploy the RF electrode with the aid of a virtual navigation system. If the tumor was not clearly identified on the unenhanced CBCT scan, a right retrograde arterial femoral access was established to carry out hepatic angiography and localize the tumor. Patients' lesions and procedural variables were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Three patients (2 male and 1 female), aged 68, 76, and 87 years were included; 3 lesions (2 hepato-cellular carcinoma and 1 metastasis from colorectal cancer) were treated. One patient required hepatic angiography. Cycles of apnea used to acquire CBCT images and to deploy the electrode lasted <120 s. Mean fluoroscopic time needed to deploy the electrode was 36.6 ± 5.7 min. Mean overall procedural time was 66.0 ± 22.9 min. No peri- or post-procedural complications were noted. No cases of incomplete ablation were noted at 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Percutaneous CBCT-guided liver RFA with or without arterial hepatic angiography is technically feasible.","Cazzato, Roberto Luigi; Buy, Xavier; Alberti, Nicolas; Fonck, Mariane; Grasso, Rosario Francesco; Palussière, Jean",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-1019-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373799/,36

The lateral flow assay misdiagnosed ∼2 out of 3 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Our quantum dot barcode device has ∼3 times greater clinical sensitivity because it is ∼140 times more analytically sensitive than lateral flow assays. Our device can diagnose SARS-CoV-2 at different sampling dates and infectious severity.

112421,Dermoscopy-Assisted Tick Extraction.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Interferons are produced in response to the presence of pathogens in cells and are responsible for the proper formation of immune reaction. Preliminary data obtained in studies of properties of recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-γ) that involved patients with community-acquired pneumonia (including bacterial), acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI), influenza and new coronavirus infection have shown promising results.The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of subcutaneous administration of IFN-γ in patients with viral pneumonia on the changes of vital signs and the duration of hospital stay. MATERIAL AND METHODS An open-label, randomized, low-interventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID-19 over 18 years of age of both sexes. IFN-γ 500,000 IU was administered s/c, daily, once a day, during 5 days. RESULTS IFN-y in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID-19. Special emphasis should be made to the fact that patients who received recombinant IFN- γ experienced no progression of respiratory failure and required no transfer to intensive care unit. DISCUSSION This study confirms earlier obtained data on the positive effect of IFN-y on the rate of clinical stabilization and recovery of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and viral infections. Presented results are limited to a small number of patients; further study of drug properties in post-marketing studies is required. CONCLUSION Progress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 by adding recombinant IFN-γ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection.","Myasnikov, A L; Berns, S A; Talyzin, P A; Ershov, F I",Voprosy virusologii,https://doi.org/10.36233/0507-4088-24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683065/,36
112527,Authors' response re: From the frontlines of COVID-19-How prepared are we as obstetricians: a commentary.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is associated with high radiation dose to the female breasts. Bismuth breast shielding offers the potential to significantly reduce dose to the breasts and nearby organs, but the magnitude of this reduction and its impact on image quality and radiation dose have not been evaluated. METHODS Radiation doses from CCTA to critical organs were determined using metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors positioned in a customized anthropomorphic whole-body dosimetry verification phantom. Image noise and signal were measured in regions of interest (ROIs) including the coronary arteries. RESULTS With bismuth shielding, breast radiation dose was reduced 46%-57% depending on breast size and scanning technique, with more moderate dose reduction to the heart, lungs, and esophagus. However, shielding significantly decreased image signal (by 14.6 HU) and contrast (by 28.4 HU), modestly but significantly increased image noise in ROIs in locations of coronary arteries, and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio by 20.9%. CONCLUSIONS While bismuth breast shielding can significantly decrease radiation dose to critical organs, it is associated with an increase in image noise, decrease in contrast-to-noise, and changes tissue attenuation characteristics in the location of the coronary arteries.","Einstein, Andrew J; Elliston, Carl D; Groves, Daniel W; Cheng, Bin; Wolff, Steven D; Pearson, Gregory D N; Robert Peters, M; Johnson, Lynne L; Bokhari, Sabahat; Johnson, Gary W; Bhatia, Ketan; Pozniakoff, Theodore; Brenner, David J",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12350-011-9473-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22068687/,36

We describe an interprofessional, student-run vaccine outreach program (VOP) in Davidson County, Tennessee that lowers barriers to vaccination through free vaccination events in nontraditional community locations. We provide this framework as a model to expand novel, seasonal, or outbreak-oriented vaccine outreach to resource-poor populations. Demographic data were collected from the patients who received an influenza vaccine between 2015 and 2019 through an optional survey to determine whether these events were reaching unhoused, uninsured, and/or unemployed individuals. Of 1803 patients, 1733 (96.1%) completed at least one field of the demographic form. Overall, 481 (27.8%) were individuals without homes or living in temporary housing and 673 (38.8%) were unemployed. Most patients, 1109 (64.0%), did not have health insurance at any point during the prior two years. With the addition of a nurse practitioner student to VOP leadership, the 2018-2019 VOP reached the most homeless or temporarily-housed (228, 32.3%), unemployed (313, 18.5%), and disabled (60, 8.5%) patients. The VOP can be adapted to meet community needs, funding, and volunteer interest. The VOP model may be applicable to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, especially since the economic impact of COVID-19 has increased unemployment rates and housing instability. Healthcare students serve as an eager, underutilized resource who can be leveraged to disseminate vaccines to individuals with limited access to care.","Brown, Sarah H; Fisher, Emilie L; Taylor, Alexandra Q; Neuzil, Kevin E; Trump, Samuel W; Sack, Daniel E; Fricker, Gregory P; Miller, Robert F",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609616/,36

The infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) targets primarily the bursa of Fabricius (BF) of chickens, causing severe immunodeficiency. Here, we characterized the cellular proteome changes of the BF caused by IBDV replication in vivo using 2DE followed MALDI-TOF MS identification. Comparative analysis of multiple 2DE gels revealed that the majority of protein expression changes appeared between 24 and 96 h after IBDV infection. MS identified 54 altered cell proteins, 12 of which were notably upregulated by IBDV infection. Meanwhile, the other 42 cellular proteins were considerably suppressed by IBDV infection and are involved in protein degradation, energy metabolism, stress response, host macromolecular biosynthesis, and transport process. The upregulation of β-actin and downregulation of dynamin during IBDV infection were also confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. These altered protein expressions provide a response profile of chicken BF to virulent IBDV infection. Further functional study on these altered proteins may lead to better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of virulent IBDV infection and to new potential therapeutic targets.","Wu, Yongping; Peng, Caie; Xu, Li; Zheng, Xiaojuan; Liao, Min; Yan, Yan; Jin, Yulan; Zhou, Jiyong",Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201100479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22623289/,36

Data in real-life settings are lacking. Methods This was a multicentre observational prospective cohort study conducted in Europe and Canada. Effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of Cortiment®MMX® in a real-life setting of patients treated for mild-to-moderate UC was investigated. Patients were prescribed Cortiment®MMX® in accordance with the Summary of the Product Characteristics (SmPC).The primary endpoint was the clinical benefit of Cortiment® MMX® in routine practice (improvement ≥ 3 points in the clinical sub-scores of the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, UCDAI). Results Data from 326 patients with mild-to-moderate UC were analysed for the primary endpoint. Clinical benefit was achieved in 60.1% (196/326) of patients at the end of Cortiment®MMX® treatment. Clinical remission (UCDAI clinical sub-score ≤ 1), full symptoms resolution (rectal bleeding (RB) = 0 and stool frequency (SF) = 0) and symptoms resolution (RB = 0 + SF ≤ 1) at the end of the Cortiment®MMX® treatment were achieved in 51.8%, 45.1% and 63.2% of patients, respectively. The median time to symptoms resolution was 30 days (range 29.0-36.0 days). Fifty patients (14.3%) had to discontinue Cortiment®MMX® due to adverse events; 17.5% of patients (n = 61) reported at least one adverse event related to the study drug. Conclusions This was the first time that a large cohort study was conducted with Cortiment®MMX® in a real-life setting. It demonstrated that Cortiment®MMX® is effective, safe and well tolerated in about 60% of UC patients.","Danese, Silvio; Hart, Ailsa; Dignass, Axel; Fiorino, Gionata; Louis, Edouard; Bonovas, Stefanos; D'Haens, Geert; Dotan, Iris; Rogler, Gerhard; Paridaens, Kristine; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640619864848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700630/,36

115841,The Present and Future of Genomics in Adult Reconstructive Orthopaedic Surgery.,2016,"PURPOSE Polymer-based textile meshes for abdominal hernia treatment are invisible by conventional imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Integration of iron particles in the mesh base material allows MRI visualization of meshes. Positive-contrast susceptibility imaging (PCSI) was implemented to separate susceptibility-induced voids from proton-deficient voids. The purpose of this study was to compare PCSI with conventional gradient echo and turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences for the in vivo assessment of superparamagnetic iron oxide particle-loaded surgical meshes in an animal model. METHODS AND MATERIALS Iron-loaded polymer meshes were implanted into the abdominal wall of 10 rabbits. At days 1, 30, and 90 after surgery, conventional gradient echo, TSE, and PCSI were performed at 1.5 T in the sagittal and axial planes. Images were scored by 2 radiologists with respect to mesh visibility, delineation of the surrounding tissue, differentiation from other structures, and overall diagnostic use, on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (insufficient) to 4 (excellent). The results were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The mesh shape, possible deformation or fracture, and possible mesh migration were evaluated on the different pulse sequences and compared with the results at surgery and autopsy. RESULTS The iron-loaded meshes appeared as hypointense signal voids on gradient echo sequences, as a hyperintense line on PCSI, and as a very thin dark line on TSE images. In all animals, a precise depiction of the mesh location and its spatial configuration and integrity was possible by MRI and confirmed by surgical and autopsy results. In all 4 categories and at all 3 time points of imaging, image quality scores were significantly higher for gradient echo imaging (range, 3.60-3.80) compared with PCSI (range, 3.12-3.42) and TSE (range, 1.64-1.89). At day 90, the image quality ratings of gradient echo and PCSI were comparable. In 2 cases, the complete delineation of mesh borders was impossible because of signal voids of adjacent anatomical structures, whereas PCSI helped achieve this differentiation. CONCLUSION In this rabbit model of iron-loaded implanted abdominal meshes, standard gradient echo imaging was best suitable to assess implant location, integrity, and configuration. In 2 of 10 animals, PCSI helped achieve a complete delineation of mesh borders.","Kraemer, Nils A; Donker, Hank C W; Kuehnert, Nicolas; Otto, Jens; Schrading, Simone; Krombach, Gabriele A; Klinge, Uwe; Kuhl, Christiane K",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0b013e31827efd14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23344516/,36

119057,Uncertainty and Optimism.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE While guidelines recommend outpatient management of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), little is known about the disposition of patients with PE diagnosed in United States (US) Emergency Departments (EDs). We sought to determine disposition practices and subsequent healthcare utilization in patients with acute PE in US EDs. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients with a new diagnosis of acute PE treated at 740 US acute care hospitals from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2018. The primary outcome was the initial disposition following an ED visit for acute PE. Additional measures included hospital cost and 30-day revisit rate to the ED. RESULTS A total of 61,070 cases were included in the overall cohort, of which 4.1% of new cases of PE were discharged from the ED. The median hospital-specific proportion of patients discharged was 3.1% (IQR 0.8, 6.8). The median odds ratio, representing the importance of the hospital in initial disposition decisions, was 2.21 (95% CI 2.05, 2.37), which was greater than any patient-level factor with the exception of concurrent ED diagnosis of hypoxemia/respiratory failure, shock, or hypotension. Within 30 days of discharge, 17.9% of discharged cases had a ED return visit to the ED only and 10.3% of patients were hospitalized. Of the 30-day ED return visits in patients initially managed as outpatients, 1.3% had a bleeding-associated diagnosis.

119126,Emerging therapeutics for the management of COVID 19.,2020-08-15,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has changed bronchoscopy practices worldwide. Bronchoscopy is a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure with a potential for direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure and hospital-acquired infection. Current guidelines about personal protective equipment and environment considerations represent key competencies to minimize droplets dispersion and reduce the risk of transmission. Different measures should be put in field based on setting, patient's clinical characteristics, urgency and indications of bronchoscopy. The use of this technique in SARS-CoV-2 patients is reported primarily for removal of airway plugs and for obtaining microbiological culture samples. In mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2, bronchoscopy is commonly used to manage complications such as hemoptysis, atelectasis or lung collapse when prone positioning, physiotherapy or recruitment maneuvers have failed. Further indications are represented by assistance during percutaneous tracheostomy. Continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive ventilation support and high flow nasal cannula oxygen are frequently used in patient affected by Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): management of patients' airways and ventilation strategies differs from bronchoscopy indications, patient's clinical status and in course or required ventilatory support. Sedation is usually administered by the pulmonologist (performing the bronchoscopy) or by the anesthetist depending on the complexity of the procedure and the level of sedation required. Finally, elective bronchoscopy for diagnostic indications during COVID-19 pandemic should be carried on respecting rigid standards which allow to minimize potential viral transmission, independently from patient's COVID-19 status. This narrative review aims to evaluate the indications, procedural measures and ventilatory strategies of bronchoscopy performed in different settings during COVID-19 pandemic.","Patrucco, Filippo; Failla, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Giovanni; Galasso, Thomas; Candoli, Piero; Mondoni, Michele; Piro, Roberto; Facciolongo, Nicola C; Renda, Teresa; Salio, Mario; Scala, Raffaele; Solidoro, Paolo; Mattei, Alessio; Donato, Paolo; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Balbo, Piero E",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.21.04533-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606187/,36
119237,Open exploration converted to laparoscopic: a useful technique in emergency hernia surgery.,2020-07-31,"The force-velocity (F-V) properties of isolated muscles or muscle fibers have been well studied in humans and other animals. However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F-V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles' cross-sectional areas and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F-V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but due to differences in muscle architecture, the muscles' contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions to independent estimates of the muscles' contributions based upon sonomicrometry (SONO) measurements of muscle lengths. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from SONO based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles' contributions to the group F-V properties.","Javidi, Mehrdad; McGowan, Craig P; Lin, David C",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.219980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680898/,36

METHODS We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP < 0.15). RESULTS Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.","Morra, Anna; Escala-Garcia, Maria; Beesley, Jonathan; Keeman, Renske; Canisius, Sander; Ahearn, Thomas U; Andrulis, Irene L; Anton-Culver, Hoda; Arndt, Volker; Auer, Paul L; Augustinsson, Annelie; Beane Freeman, Laura E; Becher, Heiko; Beckmann, Matthias W; Behrens, Sabine; Bojesen, Stig E; Bolla, Manjeet K; Brenner, Hermann; Brüning, Thomas; Buys, Saundra S; Caan, Bette; Campa, Daniele; Canzian, Federico; Castelao, Jose E; Chang-Claude, Jenny; Chanock, Stephen J; Cheng, Ting-Yuan David; Clarke, Christine L; Colonna, Sarah V; Couch, Fergus J; Cox, Angela; Cross, Simon S; Czene, Kamila; Daly, Mary B; Dennis, Joe; Dörk, Thilo; Dossus, Laure; Dunning, Alison M; Dwek, Miriam; Eccles, Diana M; Ekici, Arif B; Eliassen, A Heather; Eriksson, Mikael; Evans, D Gareth; Fasching, Peter A; Flyger, Henrik; Fritschi, Lin; Gago-Dominguez, Manuela; García-Sáenz, José A; Giles, Graham G; Grip, Mervi; Guénel, Pascal; Gündert, Melanie; Hahnen, Eric; Haiman, Christopher A; Håkansson, Niclas; Hall, Per; Hamann, Ute; Hart, Steven N; Hartikainen, Jaana M; Hartmann, Arndt; He, Wei; Hooning, Maartje J; Hoppe, Reiner; Hopper, John L; Howell, Anthony; Hunter, David J; Jager, Agnes; Jakubowska, Anna; Janni, Wolfgang; John, Esther M; Jung, Audrey Y; Kaaks, Rudolf; Keupers, Machteld; Kitahara, Cari M; Koutros, Stella; Kraft, Peter; Kristensen, Vessela N; Kurian, Allison W; Lacey, James V; Lambrechts, Diether; Le Marchand, Loic; Lindblom, Annika; Linet, Martha; Luben, Robert N; Lubiński, Jan; Lush, Michael; Mannermaa, Arto; Manoochehri, Mehdi; Margolin, Sara; Martens, John W M; Martinez, Maria Elena; Mavroudis, Dimitrios; Michailidou, Kyriaki; Milne, Roger L; Mulligan, Anna Marie; Muranen, Taru A; Nevanlinna, Heli; Newman, William G; Nielsen, Sune F; Nordestgaard, Børge G; Olshan, Andrew F; Olsson, Håkan; Orr, Nick; Park-Simon, Tjoung-Won; Patel, Alpa V; Peissel, Bernard; Peterlongo, Paolo; Plaseska-Karanfilska, Dijana; Prajzendanc, Karolina; Prentice, Ross; Presneau, Nadege; Rack, Brigitte; Rennert, Gad; Rennert, Hedy S; Rhenius, Valerie; Romero, Atocha; Roylance, Rebecca; Ruebner, Matthias; Saloustros, Emmanouil; Sawyer, Elinor J; Schmutzler, Rita K; Schneeweiss, Andreas; Scott, Christopher; Shah, Mitul; Smichkoska, Snezhana; Southey, Melissa C; Stone, Jennifer; Surowy, Harald; Swerdlow, Anthony J; Tamimi, Rulla M; Tapper, William J; Teras, Lauren R; Terry, Mary Beth; Tollenaar, Rob A E M; Tomlinson, Ian; Troester, Melissa A; Truong, Thérèse; Vachon, Celine M; Wang, Qin; Hurson, Amber N; Winqvist, Robert; Wolk, Alicja; Ziogas, Argyrios; Brauch, Hiltrud; García-Closas, Montserrat; Pharoah, Paul D P; Easton, Douglas F; Chenevix-Trench, Georgia; Schmidt, Marjanka K",Breast cancer research : BCR,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-021-01450-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407845/,36

METHODS In this retrospective UK multicentre cohort study, we recorded clinical data of paediatric-onset AQP4-IgG NMOSD. Univariate and exploratory multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify long-term predictors of permanent visual disability, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 and cognitive impairment. RESULTS We included 49 paediatric-onset AQP4-IgG patients (38.8% white, 34.7% black, 20.4% Asians and 6.1% mixed), mean onset age of 12±4.1 years, and 87.7% were female. Multifocal onset presentation occurred in 26.5% of patients, and optic nerve (47%), area postrema/brainstem (48.9%) and encephalon (28.6%) were the most involved areas. Overall, 52.3% of children had their first relapse within 1 year from disease onset. Children with onset age <12 years were more likely to have an earlier first relapse (p=0.030), despite showing no difference in time to immunosuppression compared with those aged 12-18 years at onset. At the cohort median disease duration of 79 months, 34.3% had developed permanent visual disability, 20.7% EDSS score 4 and 25.8% cognitive impairment. Visual disability was associated with white race (p=0.032) and optic neuritis presentations (p=0.002). Cognitive impairment was predicted by cerebral syndrome presentations (p=0.048), particularly if resistant to steroids (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS Age at onset, race, onset symptoms and resistance to acute therapy at onset attack predict first relapse and long-term disabilities. The recognition of these predictors may help to power future paediatric clinical trials and to direct early therapeutic decisions in AQP4-IgG NMOSD.","Camera, Valentina; Messina, Silvia; Elhadd, Kariem Tarek; Sanpera-Iglesias, Julia; Mariano, Romina; Hacohen, Yael; Dobson, Ruth; Meletti, Stefano; Wassmer, Evangeline; Lim, Ming J; Huda, Saif; Hemingway, Cheryl; Leite, Maria Isabel; Ramdas, Sithara; Palace, Jacqueline","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583946/,36

In this article, we present two similar cases in which technological advances impacted diagnosis, treatment, and results. Both patients developed massive PA after deep venous puncture attempts. The first case occurred in 1993 and was diagnosed by a duplex scan that revealed a large PA originating from the right subclavian artery. The artery was approached by median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. The PA originated from the thyrocervical trunk and was treated with simple ligation. The second case was in 2017. Angiotomography revealed a PA originating in the vertebral artery, which was treated with endovascular techniques, maintaining vessel patency. Both patients progressed satisfactorily, despite quite different approaches. Cervicothoracic vascular lesions represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, where the risk of rupture is high.

125434,Translating Best Evidence into Best Care.,2017,"RATIONALE Human metapneumovirus is a newly described virus isolated in 2001 from children with acute respiratory viral infection. It has subsequently been reported globally, although there are limited data in lung transplant recipients. OBJECTIVES To prospectively analyze whether human metapneumovirus was circulating in our adult lung transplant community and assess the morbidity of this infection and to compare the clinical presentation and outcome after intravenous ribavirin of human metapneumovirus with that of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS Lung transplant patients with clinical features of respiratory viral infection underwent nasopharyngeal aspirates. Patients with a positive specimen for RSV or human metapneumovirus by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and graft dysfunction received intravenous ribavirin and pulse steroid therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Eighty-nine patients had 199 visits for aspirate studies. A viral cause was determined for 62 visits in 47 patients (19 human metapneumovirus, 18 RSV, 13 parainfluenza, 9 influenza A, 2 adenovirus, and 1 influenza B). A significant percentage of patients with metapneumovirus (63%) and RSV (72%) developed graft dysfunction, with average declines in FEV(1) of 30 +/- 12.4% and 25.9 +/- 11.2%, respectively. In these patients, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome onset or progression occurred in no patients with human metapneumovirus compared with 5 of 13 (38%) patients with RSV at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Human metapneumovirus is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract illness in lung transplant recipients. The incidence and clinical spectrum at presentation are similar to RSV, although the latter seems to be associated with a higher risk of chronic rejection. We recommend testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates for human metapneumovirus with polymerase chain reaction to assess local epidemiologic patterns.","Hopkins, Peter; McNeil, Keith; Kermeen, Fiona; Musk, Michael; McQueen, Emily; Mackay, Ian; Sloots, Terry; Nissen, Michael",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200711-1657oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18658110/,36

The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects. It is tempting to speculate that inositol could be beneficial in managing the most dreadful effects of Sars-CoV-2 infection.","Bizzarri, M; Laganà, A S; Aragona, D; Unfer, V",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271462/,36

While the extracranial neurovascular manifestations of Takayasu arteritis are well-established, little is known regarding the intracranial manifestations. In this study, we characterize the intracranial and cervical neurovascular radiologic findings in patients with Takayasu arteritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with Takayasu arteritis who presented to our institution between 2001 and 2016 with intracranial and/or cervical vascular imaging were included in this study. Images were evaluated for the presence of vascular abnormalities, including intracranial or extracranial stenosis, vessel-wall thickening, dissection, subclavian steal, aneurysms, infarcts, and hemorrhages. Descriptive analyses are reported. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients with Takayasu arteritis met the criteria for inclusion in this study. The most common presenting neurologic symptoms were headache (32.9%) and dizziness (15.2%). Intracranial and extracranial vascular imaging was performed in 84.8% and 89.9% of patients, respectively. Among patients with intracranial vascular imaging, 3 (3.9%) had intracranial aneurysms, 3 (3.9%) had acute large-vessel occlusion, 6 (7.6%) had intracranial vasculitis, and 1 (1.3%) had reversible cerebrovascular constriction syndrome. Among patients with cervical vascular imaging, 42 (53.1%) had some degree of narrowing of the common carotid artery and 18 (22.8%) had narrowing of the ICAs. Seventeen patients (23.6%) had subclavian steal. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial vascular abnormalities in patients with Takayasu arteritis presenting with neurologic symptoms are not rare, with cerebral vasculitis seen in 7.8% of patients, and stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusion, in 3.9% of patients. Cervical vascular manifestations of Takayasu arteritis were present in most patients in our study.","Bond, K M; Nasr, D; Lehman, V; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Brinjikji, W",AJNR.

126375,Covid-19 vaccines: delivering protective immunity.,2020-12-17,"We have developed periscope, a tool for the detection and quantification of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data. The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed ""subgenomic RNAs."" sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription, which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L, which is located in the 5' UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5' end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, United Kingdom, and validated our findings using orthogonal data sets and in vitro cell systems. By using a simple local alignment to detect reads that contain the leader sequence, we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and noncanonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at the expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing data sets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","Parker, Matthew D; Lindsey, Benjamin B; Leary, Shay; Gaudieri, Silvana; Chopra, Abha; Wyles, Matthew; Angyal, Adrienn; Green, Luke R; Parsons, Paul; Tucker, Rachel M; Brown, Rebecca; Groves, Danielle; Johnson, Katie; Carrilero, Laura; Heffer, Joe; Partridge, David G; Evans, Cariad; Raza, Mohammad; Keeley, Alexander J; Smith, Nikki; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Shepherd, James G; Davis, Chris; Bennett, Sahan; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Kohl, Alain; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Thomson, Emma C; Wang, Dennis; Mallal, Simon; de Silva, Thushan I",Genome research,https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.268110.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722935/,36

It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range.

Non-guideline recommended analgesic and sedative medication regimens and deeper sedation targets have been employed for patients with COVID-19 due to exaggerated analgesia and sedation requirements with extended durations of mechanical ventilation. This, coupled with a desire to minimize nurse entry into COVID-19 patient rooms, marked obesity, altered end-organ function, and evolving medication shortages, presents numerous short- and long-term challenges. Alternative analgesic and sedative agents and regimens may pose safety risks and require judicious bedside management for appropriate use.

Regular practice activity has come to a virtual standstill and the dental industry has seen a very significant reduction in its provision of products and services. There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry. Dentistry is generally classified in the very high-risk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved. From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.","Proffitt, Edmund",British dental journal,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-020-1583-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385458/,36
130408,COVID-19 Vaccine Considerations during Pregnancy and Lactation.,2021-05-01,"COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already resulted huge setback to mankind in terms of millions of deaths while the unavailability of appropriate therapeutic strategy has made the scenario much more severe. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3,7,8 and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing proinflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study is hoped to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in-silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7 respectively and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is a maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and could serve as useful targets for the conception of therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.

130729,COVID-19 Outbreak Following a Single Patient Exposure at an Entertainment Site: An Epidemiological Study.,2020-07-28,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DA). PD treatment remains unsatisfactory as the current synthetic drugs in clinical use relies on managing only motor symptoms. This study investigated antioxidant potentials of selected compounds namely, 5,6,7,4´-tetramethoxyflavone (1), 6-hydroxy-2,3,4,4´-tetramethoxychalcone (2), 6-methoxyhamiltone A (3), diosquinone (4) and toussantine D (5) against rotenone (6) induced PD in Drosophila melanogaster. Toxicity of these compounds was conducted by monitoring flies' survival for seven days and determining the lethal concentrations (LC50). Whereas compound 1 had LC50 value of 91.3 µM within three days, compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 had LC50 values of 87.2, 58.0, 64.0 and > 1000 µM, respectively on the seventh day of the experiment. We exposed flies (1-4 days old) to 500 µM rotenone and co-treated with different doses of the test compounds in the diet for seven days at final concentrations of 11.0, 43.6 and 87.2 µM for compounds 2 and 3. The concentrations used for compound 4 were 8.0, 32.0 and 64.0 µM, while 250, 500 and 1000 µM were used for compound 5. Rotenone fed flies showed impaired climbing ability compared to control flies, the phenotype that was rescued by the treatment of tested phytochemicals. Rotenone toxicity also increased malondialdehyde levels assayed by lipid peroxidation in the brain tissues relative to control flies. This effect was reduced in flies exposed to rotenone and co-treated with the phytochemicals. Moreover, expression levels of mRNA of antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase and catalase were elevated in flies treated with rotenone and normalized in flies that were co-treated with tested compounds. Besides compound 1, this study provides overall evidence that the tested flavonoids and polyketides ameliorated the rotenone provoked neurotoxicity in D. melanogaster by battling the induced oxidative stress in brain cells including DA neurons and hence rescue the locomotor behaviour deficits.","Siima, Angela A; Stephano, Flora; Munissi, Joan J E; Nyandoro, Stephen S",Neurotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937168/,36

MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 101 patients who underwent TLH between June 2017 and December 2018 for benigngynecological disorders were analyzed retrospectively. Conventional bipolar forceps (Robi forceps) were used in 37 patientsand advanced bipolar instruments (LigaSure) were used in 64 patients. Data about the characteristics of the patients, operationtime, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay and other perioperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients in the conventional bipolar and LigaSure groups were 47.6 ± 6.5 and 48.1 ± 7 years,respectively (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to all otherpatient characteristics; body mass index, parity, previous pelvic operation and indications of hysterectomy (p > 0.05). Themean operation time (41 ± 13.2 vs 37 ± 11.5 min), estimated intraoperative blood loss (70 ± 22 vs 65 ± 21 mL) and absolutechange in hemoglobin (-1.23 ± 1.12 vs -1.11 ± 1.14 g/dL) were slightly higher in the conventional bipolar group. However,there was no statistical significance with respect to these differences between the groups (p > 0.05).

131833,Herd immunization with childhood vaccination may provide protection against COVID-19.,2020-09-26,"Biodegradable films are a promising strategy to reduce the environmental impact caused by conventional plastics commonly used in agriculture. This study focused on the production and characterization of Konjac glucomannan (KGM) and alginate (ALG) based films enriched with sugarcane vinasse (VIN), a nutrient-rich wastewater generated in large volumes by the sugar-ethanol producing industries. ALG, KGM and ALG/KGM blended (50:50) films were produced by casting and treated with calcium ions (Ca2+) (ALG films) and a combination of Ca2+, alkali, and ethanol (KGM and ALG/KGM films). Vinasse addition tended to reduce transparency and water resistance of the films and had less effect on their mechanical properties. Crosslinking of ALG films resulted in enhanced mechanical properties and reduced moisture content, water solubility, swelling, water vapor permeability, and flexibility. KGM films were less impacted by crosslinking/deacetylation but showed improved water resistance while maintain a high degree of swelling (290% and 185% for KGM and KGM/VIN films respectively). Blended films exhibited characteristic properties of the two biopolymers and adequate compatibility indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and morphologies. Vinasse-added ALG/KGM films represent a novel nutrient-enriched, bio-based material for agricultural applications and could help to face the environmental challenges imposed by vinasse disposal.","Santos, Nathalia Leal; de Oliveira Ragazzo, Gabriel; Cerri, Bianca Carreiro; Soares, Marcio Roberto; Kieckbusch, Theo Guenter; da Silva, Mariana Altenhofen",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069823/,36

Besides the placement of a Nathanson liver retractor in the subxiphoidal position, no additional trocars had to be added. The partial gastrectomy was carried out by using clinical prototypes of double-bended intruments and of a ""goose neck"" videolaparoscope, all specially designed for single-port surgery. RESULTS Total operative time was 140 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 10 mL. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred. Hospital stay was 4 days.

132050,Evaluating sources of bias in observational studies.,2021-04-01,"Monitoring outcomes of health care providers, such as patient deaths, hospitalizations, and hospital readmissions, helps in assessing the quality of health care. We consider a large database on patients being treated at dialysis facilities in the United States, and the problem of identifying facilities with outcomes that are better than or worse than expected. Analyses of such data have been commonly based on random or fixed facility effects, which have shortcomings that can lead to unfair assessments. A primary issue is that they do not appropriately account for variation between providers that is outside the providers' control due, for example, to unobserved patient characteristics that vary between providers. In this article, we propose a smoothed empirical null approach that accounts for the total variation and adapts to different provider sizes. The linear model provides an illustration that extends easily to other non-linear models for survival or binary outcomes, for example. The empirical null method is generalized to allow for some variation being due to quality of care. These methods are examined with numerical simulations and applied to the monitoring of survival in the dialysis facility data.","Xia, Lu; He, Kevin; Li, Yanming; Kalbfleisch, John",Biostatistics,https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530460/,36

Intraoperative and clinical outcomes for SILS sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and adjustable gastric banding (AGB) seem comparable to conventional laparoscopy. SILS for SG was safe and feasible with good outcomes. The same stands for RYGB but more studies are necessary for safe conclusions, while additional trocars are necessary to perform the procedure. AGB is feasible and safe by SILS but the declining number of annual procedures will probably limit the use of SILS.

132340,COVID-19 and Urology: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.,2020-04-06,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause severe clinical disease in allograft recipients and infants infected in utero Virus neutralizing antibodies defined in vitro have been proposed to confer protection against HCMV infection and the virion envelope glycoprotein B (gB) serves as a major target of neutralizing antibodies. The viral fusion protein gB is non-fusogenic on its own and requires glycoproteins H (gH) and L (gL) for membrane fusion, which is in contrast to related class III fusion proteins including Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein G or Baculovirus gp64. To explore requirements for gB's fusion activity, we generated a set of chimeras composed of gB and VSV-G or gp64, respectively. These gB chimeras were intrinsically fusion active and led to the formation of multinucleated cell syncytia when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins. Utilizing a panel of virus neutralizing gB-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we could demonstrate that syncytium formation of the fusogenic gB/VSV-G chimera can be significantly inhibited by only a subset of neutralizing mAbs which target antigenic domain 5 (AD-5) of gB. This observation argues for differential modes of action of neutralizing anti-gB mAbs and suggests that blocking the membrane fusion function of gB could be one mechanism of antibody-mediated virus neutralization. In addition, our data have important implications for the further understanding of the conformation of gB that promotes membrane fusion as well as the identification of structures in AD-5 that could be targeted by antibodies to block this early step in HCMV infection.IMPORTANCE HCMV is a major global health concern and antiviral chemotherapy remains problematic due to toxicity of available compounds and the emergence of drug resistant viruses. Thus, an HCMV vaccine represents a priority for both governmental and pharmaceutical research programs. A major obstacle for the development of a vaccine is a lack of knowledge of the nature and specificities of protective immune responses that should be induced by such a vaccine. Glycoprotein B of HCMV is an important target for neutralizing antibodies and hence is often included as a component of intervention strategies. By generation of fusion-active gB chimeras we were able to identify target structures of neutralizing antibodies that potently block gB-induced membrane fusion. This experimental system provides an approach to screen for antibodies that interfere with gB's fusogenic activity. In summary, our data will likely contribute to both rational vaccine design and the development of antibody-based therapies against HCMV.","Reuter, Nina; Kropff, Barbara; Schneiderbanger, Julia K; Alt, Mira; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Sinzger, Christian; Winkler, Thomas H; Britt, William J; Mach, Michael; Thomas, Marco",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01276-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641474/,36
132468,Cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) for the treatment of fibromyalgia.,2020-09-01,"Many patients are in pain when they receive gait training during rehabilitation. Based on animal studies, it has been proposed that central sensitization associated to nociception (maladaptive plasticity) and plasticity related to the sensorimotor learning (adaptive plasticity) share similar neural mechanisms and compete with each other. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether experimental tonic pain influences motor learning (acquisition and next-day retention) of a new locomotor task. Thirty healthy human subjects performed a locomotor adaptation task (perturbing force field applied to the ankle during swing using a robotized orthosis) on 2 consecutive days. Learning was assessed using kinematic measures (peak and mean absolute plantarflexion errors) and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Half of the participants performed the locomotor adaptation task with pain on Day 1 (capsaicin cream around the ankle), while the task was performed pain-free for all subjects on Day 2 to assess retention. Pain had no significant effect on baseline gait parameters nor on performance during the locomotor adaptation task (for either kinematic or EMG measures) on Day 1. Despite this apparently normal motor acquisition, pain-free Day 2 performance was markedly and significantly impaired in the Pain group, indicating that pain during training had an impact on the retention of motor memories (interfering with consolidation and/or retrieval). These results suggest that the same motor rehabilitation intervention could be less effective if administered in the presence of pain.","Bouffard, Jason; Bouyer, Laurent J; Roy, Jean-Sébastien; Mercier, Catherine",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.5303-13.2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009252/,36

METHOD A search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Open Grey and Orthopaedic Proceedings. Studies with a level of evidence of I-III on patients (≥ 18 years) with DIATFs operated on with either EF or ORIF were included. A total of 3814 studies were identified. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomised controlled trials and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomised studies were used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS Nine studies with 478 patients, 271 ORIF and 197 EF met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up ranged from 12 to 38 months. The meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of superficial wound infections (RR = 2.94, 95% CI 1.62-5.34, p = 0.0004) and malunions (RR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.27-5.43, p = 0.009) in the EF group compared to the ORIF group. Also worse physical function was associated with the EF group. However, the overall evidence was low. CONCLUSION This systematic review is the first to report on physical function following DIATF surgery. In general, decreased physical function was reported. The meta-analysis showed lower incidence of superficial wound infection and malunion rates in the ORIF group. Heterogeneity was low. In conclusion, this review reports lower complication rates following ORIF for DIATF. The overall evidence was limited, and therefore, the authors cannot recommend ORIF to be superior to EF treatment for DIATF. More multi-centre studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess long-term physical function and complications following DIATF surgery.

DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS Cats with sepsis (n = 16) or SIRS (19) and 8 healthy control cats. PROCEDURES Clinical variables were recorded for each cat, and plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1β activities and IL-6 and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)-8 concentrations were determined at initial evaluation. RESULTS Clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with sepsis in cats included a high band neutrophil percentage, eosinopenia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. When the sepsis and SIRS groups were compared, the only significant differences in the CBC and plasma biochemical findings were band neutrophil percentage and albumin concentration. Cats with sepsis had significantly greater plasma TNF activity than did healthy cats and were more likely to have detectable concentrations of IL-6 than were cats with SIRS or healthy cats. Plasma IL-1β activity did not differ among groups, and CXCL-8 was not detectable in most (32/43) cats. Mortality rate was not significantly greater for cats with sepsis (7/16) than for cats with SIRS (5/19). Plasma IL-1β activity and IL-6 and chloride concentrations were the only variables correlated with nonsurvival in the sepsis group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cats with sepsis may have various clinicopathologic abnormalities but are more likely to have a high band neutrophil percentage and hypoalbuminemia than cats with noninfectious SIRS. Plasma interleukin-1β activity and plasma IL-6 and chloride concentrations may be useful prognostic biomarkers for septic cats.","Declue, Amy E; Delgado, Cherlene; Chang, Chee-Hoon; Sharp, Claire R",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.238.7.890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21453177/,36

Three weeks later, the US federal government declared the pandemic a national emergency. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases increased rather rapidly and changed routine daily activities of the community. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This brief report describes the response from the hospital, the regional blood center, and the hospital-based transfusion services to the events that took place in the community during the initial phases of the pandemic. RESULTS In Washington State, the first week of March started with 4 confirmed cases and ended with 150; by the end of the second week of March there were more than 700 cases of confirmed COVID-19. During the first week, blood donations dropped significantly. Blood units provided from blood centers of non-affected areas of the country helped keep inventory stable and allow for routine hospital operations. The hospital-based transfusion service began prospective triaging of blood orders to monitor and prioritize blood utilization. In the second week, blood donations recovered, and the hospital postponed elective procedures to ensure staff and personal protective equipment were appropriate for the care of critical patients. CONCLUSION As community activities are disrupted and hospital activities switch from routine operations to pandemic-focused and urgent care-oriented, the blood supply and utilization requires a number of transformations.","Pagano, Monica B; Hess, John R; Tsang, Hamilton C; Staley, Elizabeth; Gernsheimer, Terry; Sen, Nina; Clark, Christine; Nester, Theresa; Bailey, Curt; Alcorn, Kirsten",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.15789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198754/,36

134018,Periungual tumor on the finger.,2020-07-28,"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. We propose the following hypothesis: Imbalance in the action of ACE1- and ACE2-derived peptides, thereby enhancing Angiotensin-II (ANG II) signaling, a primary driver of COVID-19 pathobiology. ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2-mediated conversion of ANG II to ANG peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1-generated ANGII. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat COVID-19 by restoring ACE1/ACE2 balance: 1) ANG II receptor blockers (ARBs); 2) ACE1 inhibitors (ACEIs); 3) Agonists of receptors activated by ACE2-derived peptides [e.g., ANG (1-7), which activates MAS1]; 4) Recombinant human ACE2 or ACE2 peptides as decoys for the virus. Reducing ACE1/ACE2 imbalance is predicted to blunt COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable patients. Importantly, approved ARBs and ACEIs can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating COVID-19.","Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333398/,36

Regionally networked medical care center structures combine the advantages of optimized patient care with the growing desire of the younger generation of physicians for flexible working conditions within employment. With increasing acceptance on the part of the medical profession, networked medical care centers are able to create local structures for the expansion of modern intersectoral care and, at the same time, can be available for outpatient specialist training in internal medicine.","Grebe, Ivo G",Der Internist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00108-020-00842-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809034/,36
135014,COVID-19 in age-related neurodegenerative diseases: is there a role for vitamin D3 as a possible therapeutic strategy?,2020-11-12,Lung cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-associated cases of mortality in the USA and China. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of lung cancer cases. microRNAs (miRs) serve multiple roles in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. The current study investigated the lower level of miR-200a in tumor tissues compared with healthy tissue. Overexpression of miR-200a inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. miR-200a was identified to target Rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 2 (RHPN2) and higher levels of RHPN2 were observed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The current study proposes that miR-200a exhibits a tumor suppressive role in NSCLC and suggests that miR-200a could target RHPN2.,"Huang, Yan; Bao, Ting; Li, Zhenzhen; Ji, Guiyi; Zhang, Li",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724366/,36
135034,Spine deformity care: a team effort.,2021-02-16,"OBJECTIVES We evaluated the association between severity of illness and microbial etiology of ICU-acquired pneumonia to define if severity should be used to guide empiric antibiotic choices. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING ICUs of a university hospital. PATIENTS Three hundredy forty-three consecutive patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia clustered, according to the presence of multidrug resistant pathogens. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Two hundred eight patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia and 135 had nonventilator ICU-acquired pneumonia. We determined etiology in 217 patients (63%). The most frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty-eight patients (17%) had a multidrug-resistant causative agent. Except for a longer ICU stay and a higher rate of microbial persistence at the end of the treatment in the multidrug-resistant group, no differences were found in clinical and inflammatory characteristics, severity criteria, and mortality or survival between patients with and without multidrug-resistant pathogens, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Patients with higher severity scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) and septic shock at onset of pneumonia had significantly lower 28- and 90-day survival and higher systemic inflammatory response. The results were similar when only patients with microbial diagnosis were considered, as well as when stratified into ventilator-associated pneumonia and nonventilator ICU-acquired pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS In patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia, severity of illness seems not to affect etiology. Risk factors for multidrug resistant, but not severity of illness, should be taken into account in selecting empiric antimicrobial treatment.","Di Pasquale, Marta; Ferrer, Miquel; Esperatti, Mariano; Crisafulli, Ernesto; Giunta, Valeria; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Rinaudo, Mariano; Blasi, Francesco; Niederman, Michael; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3182a272a2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23989176/,36
135076,Flexitarian Diets and Health: A Review of the Evidence-Based Literature.,2016,"BACKGROUND 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems utilize supraglottic devices for either primary advanced airway management, or for airway rescue following failed attempts at direct laryngoscopy endotracheal intubation. There is, however, limited data on objective confirmation of supraglottic airway placement in the prehospital environment. Furthermore, the ability of EMS field providers to recognize a misplaced airway is unknown. METHODS Retrospective review of patients who underwent airway management using the King LTS-D supraglottic airway in a large urban EMS system, between 3/1/15-9/30/2015. Subjective success was defined as documentation of successful airway placement by the EMS provider. Objective success was confirmed by review of waveform capnography, with the presence of a 4-phase waveform greater than 5mmHg. Sensitivity and specificity of the field provider's assessment of success were then calculated. RESULTS A total of 344 supraglottic airway attempts were reviewed. No patients met obvious death criteria. 269 attempts (85.1%) met criteria for both subjective and objective success. 19 attempts (5.6%) were recognized failures by the EMS provider. 47 (13.8%) airways were misplaced but unrecognized by the EMS provider. 4 attempts (1.2%) were correctly placed but misidentified as failures, leading to the unnecessary removal and replacement of the airway. Sensitivity of the provider's assessment was 98.5%; specificity was 28.7%. CONCLUSION The use of supraglottic airway devices results in unrecognized failed placement. Appropriate utilization and review of waveform capnography may remedy a potential blind-spot in patient safety, and systemic monitoring/feedback processes may therefore be used to prevent unrecognized misplaced airways.","Vithalani, Veer D; Vlk, Sabrina; Davis, Steven Q; Richmond, Neal J",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28750882/,36

137015,COVID-19's Impact on Genetics at One Medical Center in New York.,2020-06-05,"When bloody stools occur in a very-low-birth-weight infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a prime consideration, though food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) can be causative and is difficult to distinguish from NEC. Food allergy is an adverse reaction following exposure to food due to an abnormal immunologic response to food, and cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most likely form of food allergy in infants. The clinical features and proper management of patients with FPIES are important to differentiate FPIES from NEC. However, there are very few study reports of preterm infants presenting with food allergy-induced enterocolitis after NEC. Here, we report a case of a very-low-birth-weight infant born at 28 weeks of gestational age who developed recurrent episodes of bloody stools when he was fed cow's milk or given breast milk fortified with milk after NEC recovery on day of life (DOL) 29, 46, and 54. A male preterm infant born at 28 weeks of gestational age presented with bloody stools on DOL 7. He was diagnosed with early-onset NEC with abdominal tenderness, sluggish bowel sounds, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level and pneumatosis intestinalis (PI). After recovery from NEC on DOL 20, the infant developed three recurrent episodes of bloody stools after being fed cow's milk or breast milk fortified with dairy milk. He was suspected of having recurrent episodes of NEC, but the infant was fairly healthy and did not present abdominal tenderness or abnormal bowel sounds on physical examination. Consecutive blood tests revealed normal CRP levels and increasing eosinophil levels. Abdominal radiograph revealed mild thickening of the small bowel, with no evidence of PI. The infant was finally diagnosed with FPIES in addition to NEC. After the infant received hydrolyzed formula, the bloody stool symptoms were finally resolved. Our case suggests that infants with recurrent episodes of bloody stools with increasing systemic eosinophils count should be considered for the diagnosis of FPIES with cow's milk formula. Rapid improvement and non-progression of systemic symptoms and signs after removing exposure to milk protein may differentiate FPIES from NEC.","Lu, Yan; Zhang, Zhi-Qun",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-21-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189099/,36

The aim of this study was to compare anatomical and functional changes occurring in the left ventricle after AVR with different sizes of mechanical valves. METHODS A total of 92 patients with serious aortic valve stenosis, who underwent AVR between March 2001 and June 2008 using mechanical valves of different sizes, were retrospectively analysed. The sizes of the mechanical valves were 19, 21, 23 and 25 mm. All patients were assessed preoperatively, and at six months and in the first, third and fifth years postoperatively. The left ventricle was assessed with electrocardiography, echocardiography and telecardiography and compared in the four patient groups, constituted according to the mechanical valve size used. RESULTS In all groups, left ventricular mass and mass index, transvalvular aortic gradient, thicknesses of the interventricular septum and posterior wall, and left ventricular endsystolic and end-diastolic diameters had decreased significantly post surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction and exercise capacity had increased significantly (p < 0.001). The most noteworthy anatomical and functional improvements were seen in patients who had received 23- and 25-mm mechanical valves. CONCLUSION Mechanical valve replacement should not be performed with small size valves because of the higher residual gradient.","Ilhan, Gokhan; Bozok, Sahin; Ozpak, Berkan; Kara, Hakan; Yazman, Serkan; Bayrak, Serdar; Ozsoyler, Ibrahim; Gurbuz, Ali",Cardiovascular journal of Africa,https://doi.org/10.5830/cvja-2018-037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059131/,36

However, the clinical relevance of heart rate response (ΔHR) and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation (EID) during 6MWT is remaining unknown. METHODS Patients undergoing PEA in our center between 03/2013-04/2014 were assessed prospectively with hemodynamic and exercise parameters prior to and 1 year post-PEA. Patients with symptomatic chronic thromboembolic disease (mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) <25 mmHg) and clinical relevant obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded. The following definitions were used: ΔHR = (peak HR - resting HR), percent heart rate reserve (HRR) = (peak HR -rest HR)/(220 - age - rest HR) x 100 and EID = SpO2 ≤88 %. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients (of 116 patients screened) with mPAP of 43.2 ± 8.7 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 605.5 ± 228.7 dyn*s/cm(5), cardiac index (CI) of 2.4 ± 0.5 l/min/m(2) and a 6MWT-distance of 404.7 ± 148.4 m and a peak VO2 of 12.3 ± 3.4 ml/min/kg prior to PEA were included. Baseline ΔHR during 6MWT was significantly associated with PVR 1 year post-PEA using linear regression analysis (r = 0.43, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated an association of HRR during 6MWT and residual PH with a hazard ratio of 1.06 (95 % Confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.99-1.14, p = 0.08). EID was observed commonly during 6MWT but no correlations to outcome parameters were found. CONCLUSIONS This is the first prospective study to describe an association of ΔHR during 6MWT with pulmonary hemodynamics 1 year post-PEA. Our preliminary results indicate that HRR derived from 6MWT is of clinical significance. EID was commonly observed, albeit failed as a significant prognostic factor.","Richter, Manuel Jonas; Milger, Katrin; Tello, Khodr; Stille, Philipp; Seeger, Werner; Mayer, Eckhard; Ghofrani, Hossein A; Gall, Henning",BMC pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-016-0260-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27377832/,36

We searched Pubmed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, EMBASE, and conference proceedings for articles that reported about use of information technology or informatics in the context of PHI. We performed qualitative synthesis and reported summary statistics. 39 studies were eligible after screening 382 titles and abstracts and reviewing 82 full texts. The top 5 person-centered key themes related to PHI included empowerment, decision-making, informed patient, collaboration, and disease management. Finally, we propose to define PHI as multidisciplinary field that uses information technology as provided through the web, smartphones, or wearables to increase participation of individuals in their care process and to enable them in self-care and shared decision-making. Goals to be achieved through PHI include maintaining health and well-being; improving the healthcare system and health outcomes; sharing experiences; achieving life goals; and self-education.","Denecke, Kerstin; Gabarron, Elia; Petersen, Carolyn; Merolli, Mark",Informatics for health & social care,https://doi.org/10.1080/17538157.2021.1883028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622168/,36

Position paper of the International Union of Angiology.,2020-09-07,"INTRODUCTION Basic Military Training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland implemented several sequential non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). One measure, arrival quarantine, has not been studied as a modern military disease prevention strategy. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 14-day arrival quarantine on symptomatic COVID-19 testing. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study compared symptomatic COVID-19 testing among all trainees who entered Basic Military Training between March 17, 2020, and April 17, 2020, before the implementation of universal arrival COVID-19 testing, during their first 2 weeks in arrival quarantine compared to the rest of their training. Furthermore, symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the last 5 weeks of training in those who completed arrival quarantine was compared to testing in the last 5 weeks for trainees who arrived between February 16, 2020, and March 16, 2020, and did not undergo arrival quarantine. Nominal variables were compared by chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. This study was approved as a public health surveillance project by the 59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board. RESULTS Five thousand five hundred and seventy-six trainees started training between February 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020, with 2,573 trainees undergoing an arrival quarantine compared to 3,003 trainees who did not. Trainees who underwent arrival quarantine had higher rates of COVID-19 testing while in arrival quarantine (10.5 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 2.3, P ≤ .001) and higher rates of concomitant influenza testing (74% vs. 38%, P = .001) compared to after they completed quarantine. Trainees that completed quarantine had less symptomatic COVID-19 testing after day 14 of training (2.3 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 14.3, P ≤ .001) and influenza testing (38% vs. 74%, P = .001) compared to trainees that did not undergo arrival quarantine. CONCLUSION Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention associated with fewer symptomatic COVID-19 tests, especially after completion of quarantine.","Marcus, Joseph E; Frankel, Dianne N; Pawlak, Mary T; Casey, Theresa M; Enriquez, Erin; Yun, Heather C",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142709/,36
140463,Genetic variability in COVID-19-related genes in the Brazilian population.,2021,"Therapeutic options for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplantation lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) are currently limited, accompanying with some off-target toxicities. We previously demonstrated that early recovery of Vδ2+ T cells inversely correlated to EBV reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Studies in vitro and in the mouse models showed the cytotoxic activity of Vδ2+ T cells on EBV-transformed lymphoproliferative cells, but the efficacy was moderate. Bisphosphonate, such as pamidronate (PAM), have been reported as a sensitizer to trigger tumor cells for Vδ2+ T cells recognition. Valproic acid (VPA) has attracted attentions due to its adjuvant anti-tumor effect with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Whether PAM and VPA facilitate the immunogenicity of EBV-infected cells towards Vδ2+ T cells cytotoxicity remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that lower dosage of VPA and/or PAM did not induce apoptosis of EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) or Vδ2+ T cells. Notably, pre-treatment with PAM significantly increased the cell death of EBV-LCLs after co-culture with Vδ2+ T cells at different ratios. Combining treatment with VPA reinforced the sensitizing effect of PAM. This efficacy was through inducing the accumulation of mevalonate pathway intermediates and dependent on the γδ T cell receptor of Vδ2+ T cells. Similar sensitizing effects of PAM and PAM plus VPA were also demonstrated on the primary PTLD cells. These results highlight the roles of PAM and VPA in the enhancement of immune surveillance and expand the fields of these two drugs in the treatment of different types of malignancies.","Gao, Haitao; Liu, Ruoyang; Wu, Ning; Mo, Xiao-Dong; Han, Wei; Huang, Xin; Huang, Xiao-Jun; Liu, Jiangying",International immunopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818705/,36

Yet, the therapeutic efficacy of CDNs has been limited by poor delivery and biostability. Here, STING-activating DNA nanovaccines (STING-NVs) are developed, which biostabilize, deliver, and conditionally release CDG in the endosome of immune cells, elicit potent antitumor immune responses in murine and human immune cells, ameliorate immunosuppression in vitro and in the tumor microenvironment, and mediate potent cancer immunotherapy in a murine melanoma model. STING-NVs have PLA-b-PEG in the core and cytosine (C)-rich i-motif DNA on the surface. i-Motif DNA undergoes characteristic pH-responsive conformational switch, allowing efficient CDG loading via C:G base pairing at physiological pH, and CDG release in sensitive response to acidic environment such as cell endosome. STING-NVs protect CDG from enzymatic degradation. STING-NVs facilitate cell delivery. Remarkably, STING-NVs promote the endosome escape of CDG by ninefold, and potentiate antitumor immunity. STING-NVs repolarize immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages into antitumor M1-like macrophages in vitro and in the tumor microenvironment of melanoma. In a poorly immunogenic murine melanoma model, intralesional STING-NVs outperform liposomal CDG and fluoride-CDG for melanoma immunotherapy. These results suggest the great potential of STING-NVs for cancer immunotherapy.","Zhang, Yu; Shen, Tingting; Zhou, Shurong; Wang, Weinan; Lin, Shuibin; Zhu, Guizhi",Advanced therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202000083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337143/,36
143246,COVID Dying.,2021-04-27,"Dietary fats are essential for cardiac function. The metabolites of fats known as fatty acids provide most of the energy for cardiac tissue, serve as building blocks for membranes and regulate important signaling cascades. Despite their importance, excess fat intake can cause cardiac dysfunction. The detrimental effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on cardiac health are widely investigated in long-term studies but the short-term effects of fats have not been thoroughly studied. To elucidate the near-term effects of a HFD on the growth and maturation of late adolescent heart we subjected 11-week-old mice to an 8-week long HFD (42% of calories from fat, 42% from carbohydrate, n = 8) or chow diet (12% of calories from fat, 66% from carbohydrate, n = 7) and assessed their effects on the heart in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that excessive fat feeding interferes with normal maturation of the heart indicated by the lack of increase in dimensions, volume, and stroke volume of the left ventricles of mice on high fat diet that were evident in mice on chow diet. In addition, differences in regional strain during the contraction cycle between mice on HFD and chow diet were seen. These changes were associated with reduced activity of the growth promoting PI3K-Akt1 signaling cascade and moderate changes in glucose metabolism without changes in calcium signaling.

In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the expression level of lncRNA forkhead box P4 antisense RNA 1 (FOXP4-AS1) is higher in NPC samples than in normal samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS Quantitative Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the expression level of RNA and protein. Luciferase reporter assay ran to test the interactions between FOXP4-AS1 and miR-423-5p and STMN1. Subcellular fractionation assay was used to determine the subcellular localization of FOXP4-AS1. The tumor-promotion functions of FOXP4-AS1 were determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS The expression of FOXP4-AS1 was up-regulated in 80 cases with NPC, and these patients with a poor prognosis. Functionally, high expression of FOXP4-AS1 in NPC was connected with promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Moreover, FOXP4-AS1 is located in the cytoplasm of CNE1 (NPC cell lines). Mechanistically, FOXP4-AS1 up-regulated STMN1 on post-transcriptional regulation by means of miR-423-5p. CONCLUSIONS Our present study demonstrated that high expression of FOXP4-AS1 in NPC portended poor outcomes. FOXP4-AS1upregulated STMN1 by interacting with miR-423-5p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to promote NPC progression.","Zhong, L-K; Zhou, J; He, X; He, B-F; Zhou, X-W; Zhu, J-L; Liu, J; Qiu, Y-H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767327/,36

The objectives of the study are twofold: a) to examine dose-response relationships between physical activity (PA) components (volume, intensity, frequency, duration) and depressive symptoms of the population during confinement, and b) to identify the optimal levels of PA to mitigate notable depressive symptoms (NDS). METHODS 4,811 (2,952 women) Spanish citizens, age range 16-92 years, completed an online questionnaire (snowball sampling) to measure their levels of depressive symptoms, PA, and various anthropometric and sociometric variables. Volume (METs-min/week), frequency (days/week), and duration (hours) were examined using logistic regressions with restricted cubic splines. RESULTS The PA components were inversely associated with NDS. Performing at least 477 METs-min/week was associated with a 33% decrease in probability of NDS, and reaching 3,000 METs-min/week was associated with the lowest risk of NDS (47%). As for frequency, with 10 times/week the probability of NDS was 56% lower. At 10 hours of weekly practice, the probability of NDS was 39% lower. CONCLUSIONS A range and optimal amount of PA is suggested to reduce the appearance of SDN during confinement.","Méndez-Giménez, Antonio; Cecchini, José A; Fernández-Río, Javier; Carriedo, Alejandro",Psicothema,https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33453743/,36

DESIGN Prospective animal study. SETTING Center of Experimental Surgery at a university hospital. ANIMALS Thirteen sheep. INTERVENTION(S) The carotid and femoral arteries were dissected bilaterally and sealed randomly with MarSeal unilaterally and consecutively with LigaSure contralaterally in vivo. Afterward the burst pressure was determined for each artery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Sealing time, failure rate, and burst pressure. RESULT(S) The mean diameter of all arteries sealed did not differ significantly between the two groups (MarSeal 5.40 mm vs. LigaSure 5.35 mm). The mean sealing time was significantly shorter with use of the reusable device (MarSeal 5.2 seconds vs. LigaSure 9.1 seconds). We did not find a significant difference in sealing failure rates between the groups (MarSeal 7.0% vs. LigaSure 9.1%). In addition, analysis of mean burst pressure did not reveal a significant difference between the different devices (MarSeal 429 mm Hg vs. LigaSure 484 mm Hg). There was no significant difference with respect to lateral thermal damage (MarSeal 0.91 cm vs. LigaSure 0.93 cm). CONCLUSION(S) In our in vivo animal study, the new reusable MarSeal device appears to be equivalently effective for vessel sealing when compared with the conventional disposable LigaSure device.","Klar, Maximilian; Haberstroh, Jörg; Timme, Sylvia; Fritzsch, Gernod; Gitsch, Gerald; Denschlag, Dominik",Fertility and sterility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951375/,36

146748,Glycyrrhizin for topical use and prophylaxis of COVID-19: an interesting pharmacological perspective.,2021,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the health public authorities to impose extraordinary policies to limit the virus spread. Lockdown has been recognized as an effective measure to minimise the risk of infection. The effect of this extreme and prolonged situation on glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unknown. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) allow health care professionals to remotely monitored sensor glucose levels. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of lockdown on glycaemic control in adults with T1D. METHODS People with T1D on multiple daily insulin injections and using CGM or FGM were included. Sensor data from the 2 weeks before the start of the COVID-19 lockdown and from the 2 weeks after 5 weeks of consecutive lockdown were compared. RESULTS 147 subjects were selected (age: 39±14 years (15-80), 54% male (n=80), diabetes duration: 18±11 years). Forty six percent (n=68) were CGM users and 54% (n=79) FGM users. Estimated HbA1c was reduced from 57±11 mmol/l to 55±11 mmol/l (7.38±1.0% to 7.16±1.0%), (p<0.001). Time 70-180 mg/dl was increased from 60.3±16.0 to 62.8±17.0 (p=0.009). Time >180 mg/dl and >250 mg/dl were reduced from 36.0±17.2 to 32.6±17.5 (p<0.001) and from 11.9±11.8 to 9.4±10.3%, (p=0.001), respectively. Time in hypoglycaemia remained unchanged. Estimated HbA1c and time in range 70-180 mg/dl showed an improvement in 62% (n=91) of the subjects. Sensor use (93%) and coefficient of variation (36%) remained unchanged.

146780,Pathogenesis guided therapeutic management of COVID-19: an immunological perspective.,2020-10-28,"INTRODUCTION Single-port laparoscopic surgery imposes unique psychomotor challenges. We used surgical simulation to define performance differences between surgeons with and without single-port clinical experience and examined whether a short course of training resulted in improved performance. METHODS Study participants were assigned to 3 groups: resident group (RES), experienced laparoscopic surgeons with (SP) and without (LAP) prior single-port laparoscopic experience. Participants performed the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery precision cutting task on a ProMIS trainer through conventional ports or with articulating instruments via a SILS Port (Covidien, Inc). Two iterations of each method were performed. Then, 6 residents performed 10 successive single-port iterations to assess the effect of practice on task performance. RESULTS The SP group had faster task times for both laparoscopic (P = .0486) and single-port (P = .0238) methods. The LAP group had longer path lengths for the single-port task than for the laparoscopic task (P = .03). The RES group was slower (P = .0019), with longer path length (P = .0010) but with greater smoothness (P = .0186) on the single-port task than the conventional laparoscopic task. Resident performance task time (P = .005) and smoothness (P = .045) improved with successive iterations. DISCUSSION Our data show that surgeons with clinical single-port surgery experience perform a simulated single-port surgical task better than inexperienced single-port surgeons. Furthermore, this performance is comparable to that achieved with conventional laparoscopic techniques. Performance of residents declined dramatically when confronted with the challenges of the single-port task but improved with practice. These results suggest a role for lab-based single-port training.","Conway, Nathan E; Romanelli, John R; Bush, Ron W; Seymour, Neal E",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350613499451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23980199/,36

Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We discovered that while expression of mouse, rat, chimpanzee, dog, horse, goat, sheep, and human Mxra8 enables alphavirus infection in cell culture, cattle Mxra8 does not. Cattle Mxra8 encodes a 15-amino acid insertion in its ectodomain that prevents Mxra8 binding to CHIKV. Identical insertions are present in zebu, yak, and the extinct auroch. As other Bovinae lineages contain related Mxra8 sequences, this insertion likely occurred at least 5 million years ago. Removing the Mxra8 insertion in Bovinae enhances alphavirus binding and infection, while introducing the insertion into mouse Mxra8 blocks CHIKV binding, prevents infection by multiple alphaviruses in cells, and mitigates CHIKV-induced pathogenesis in mice. Our studies on how this insertion provides resistance to CHIKV infection could facilitate countermeasures that disrupt Mxra8 interactions with alphaviruses.","Kim, Arthur S; Zimmerman, Ofer; Fox, Julie M; Nelson, Christopher A; Basore, Katherine; Zhang, Rong; Durnell, Lorellin; Desai, Chandni; Bullock, Christopher; Deem, Sharon L; Oppenheimer, Jonas; Shapiro, Beth; Wang, Ting; Cherry, Sara; Coyne, Carolyn B; Handley, Scott A; Landis, Michael J; Fremont, Daved H; Diamond, Michael S",Cell host & microbe,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075743/,36

150649,Capturing Our COVID-19 Efforts.,2020-06-01,"RATIONALE Endotracheal intubation is an essential step for airway management during general anesthesia. When surgeons carry out thoracic surgery such as pneumonectomy, they usually request lung isolation to secure a clear surgical view. A double lumen endotracheal tube is used for lung isolation in routine thoracic surgeries. PATIENT CONCERNS A 56-year-old man was previously diagnosed with left Aspergilloma, a tuberculosis destroyed lung, and diabetes mellitus. According to his chest x-ray and chest computed tomography, his left lung was nearly collapsed, and the result of a pulmonary function test was severely restricted. The patient's diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was 63% and predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 23.5% DIAGNOSES:: Due to his previous history, radiologic findings and laboratory test results, he was diagnosed with left Aspergilloma and tuberculosis destroyed lung. INTERVENTIONS Due to recurrence of Aspergilloma in his left lung, the patient was scheduled for a left pneumonectomy. Since the patient's partial oxygen concentration was adequate despite his left lung being nearly totally collapsed, we thought that we would be capable of performing the pneumonectomy using a single lumen tube (SLT). For a better surgical view, we planned lung isolation via insertion of a SLT deep into the bronchus. OUTCOMES During pneumonectomy, after tracheal suction was performed, we tried a lung recruitment maneuver. Suddenly end-tidal carbon dioxide did not show on the monitor. The patient's blood pressure dropped and heart rate was decreasing. We thought that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was needed and an approximately 2 cm sized hematoma was removed from the endotracheal tube after vigorous suctioning. After getting rid of the hematoma, we changed the single tube to a double lumen tube (DLT). LESSONS This case led us to the conclusion that a DLT should be used for safety when carrying out thoracic surgery. We report a rare case of an airway obstruction using a SLT during pneumonectomy.","Son, Shill Lee; Kim, Woo-Shik; Kwon, Miyoung; Moon, Yeon-Jin",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000019736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311966/,36
150663,Sudden unexpected death in infancy: Severe pulmonary anatomopathological findings in spite of inconsistent clinical features.,2021-07-04,"Redirecting the tropism of viral vectors enables specific transduction of selected cells by direct administration of vectors. We previously developed targeting lentiviral vectors by pseudotyping with modified Sindbis virus envelope proteins. These modified Sindbis virus envelope proteins have mutations in their original receptor-binding regions to eliminate their natural tropisms, and they are conjugated with targeting proteins, including antibodies and peptides, to confer their tropisms on target cells. We investigated whether our targeting vectors interact with DC-SIGN, which traps many types of viruses and gene therapy vectors by binding to the N-glycans of their envelope proteins. We found that these vectors do not interact with DC-SIGN. When these vectors were produced in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin, which alters the structures of N-glycans from complex to high mannose, these vectors used DC-SIGN as their receptor. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the N-glycans at E2 amino acid (aa) 196 and E1 aa 139 mediate binding to DC-SIGN, which supports the results of a previous report of cryoelectron microscopy analysis. In addition, we investigated whether modification of the N-glycan structures could activate serum complement activity, possibly by the lectin pathway of complement activation. DC-SIGN-targeted transduction occurs in the presence of human serum complement, demonstrating that high-mannose structure N-glycans of the envelope proteins do not activate human serum complement. These results indicate that the strategy of redirecting viral vectors according to alterations of their N-glycan structures would enable the vectors to target specific cells types expressing particular types of lectins.","Morizono, Kouki; Ku, Amy; Xie, Yiming; Harui, Airi; Kung, Sam K P; Roth, Michael D; Lee, Benhur; Chen, Irvin S Y",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00435-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484510/,36

152250,Failing Up-Using a Crisis to Implement a Visual Daily Management System for a Large Multihospital Academic Radiology Department.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Nowadays, fat grafting is a widespread technique that is commonly used in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The classical fat-harvesting method in which a 10-cc syringe and a 3.0-mm cannula are used, may be time-consuming when a large quantity of adipose tissue is required. We describe a novel technique to optimize fat harvesting, the vacuum-assisted adipose tissue suction technique (VAST), in which disposable sterile components are used. This study compares the adipose tissue harvesting speed and the adipocyte volume between the VAST and the 10-cc-syringe technique. METHODS From May 2010 to May 2012, a total of 32 patients who had structural fat grafting for breast reconstruction were enrolled in this prospective study. In 16 patients (control group) fat was harvested by the classical 10-cc-syringe technique, and in the other 16 patients (VAST group) fat was harvested by the VAST. Adipose tissue was harvested from the abdomen area in all patients. The volume of harvested adipose tissue was noted every minute during the operative procedure. The operative harvesting speed was calculated for each patient after 5 min. The volume harvested in 5 min was centrifuged, and the remaining adipocyte volume was noted after centrifugation. The operative harvesting speed and the remaining adipocyte rate were compared in both groups. RESULTS The average volume of harvested adipose tissue was 18.1 ml in the control group and 156.2 ml in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average harvesting speed was 3.6 ml/min in the control group using a 10-cc syringe and 31.2 ml/min in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average remaining adipocyte volume, after centrifugation, was 13.5 ml in the control group, and 118.2 ml in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average remaining adipocyte rate, after centrifugation, was 74.3 % in the control group and 75.4 % in the VAST group (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS Adipose tissue harvesting can be optimized safely by using the VAST before structural fat grafting. Its quickness, low cost, and efficiency make us choose this method in breast reconstruction when a significant volume of adipocytes is required.

This serious complication is elucidated by demonstration of the case of a 67-year-woman with mid-apical TS complicated by LVT, left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left middle cerebral artery (segment M2) thrombo-embolic occlusions. The cerebral artery thrombotic occlusion was treated successfully with endovascular thrombectomy with complete resolution of the neurological deficits. There was spontaneous recanalization of the apical LAD occlusion verified by cardiac computed tomography angiography.","Y-Hassan, Shams; Holmin, Staffan; Abdula, Goran; Böhm, Felix",Clinical cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.23137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30565272/,36

Laparoscopic surgery has been fully validated as alternative, minimally invasive treatment for different benign and malignant conditions. In the attempt to reduce even more the surgical trauma, natural orifices transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES™) and single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) have been proposed. Although the lack of proper instrumentations makes NOTES™ not fully suitable for advanced procedures, SILS might play a significant role, although, to date, only limited series and few case reports of single-incision right colectomy are present in the literature. METHODS After signed, informed consent was obtained, patients with malignant tumors or large polyps of the right colon underwent single-incision colonic resection through a 3-cm incision using two different single-port devices and articulated or coaxial curved instruments. Preliminary results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 36 patients were selected for SILS procedure. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to the standard laparoscopic procedure. One patient had a postoperative urinary tract infection and one prolonged ileum that did not required any surgical intervention. No complications were reported in all the remaining cases. The mean postoperative stay was 5 ± 1.2 days (range, 4-14), and mean lymph node retrieval and tumor-free margins was 24 ± 7 (range, 29-15) and 8 ± 3 (range, 6-12) cm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that single-incision laparoscopic right colectomies are feasible and safe from the oncological point of view; nevertheless larger, randomized experiences are needed to demonstrate the benefits of SILS compared with standard laparoscopic resections.","Boni, Luigi; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Cassinotti, Elisa; Di Giuseppe, Matteo; Diurni, Mario; Rausei, Stefano; Cantore, Fabrizio; Dionigi, Renzo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1100-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464415/,36

156295,Effect of Age and Morphology on Live Birth Rate After Cleavage Stage Embryo Transfer.,2020-07-09,"The aim of this work was to develop a new in vitro lipolysis-permeation model to predict the in vivo absorption of fenofibrate in self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs). More specifically, the in vitro intestinal lipolysis model was combined with the mucus-PVPA (Phospholipid Vesicle-based Permeation Assay) in vitro permeability model. Biosimilar mucus (BM) was added to the surface of the PVPA barriers to closer simulate the intestinal mucosa. SNEDDSs for which pharmacokinetic data after oral dosing to rats was available in the literature were prepared, and the ability of the SNEDDSs to maintain fenofibrate solubilized during in vitro lipolysis was determined, followed by the assessment of drug permeation across the mucus-PVPA barriers. The amount of drug solubilized over time during in vitro lipolysis did not correlate with the AUC (area under the curve) of the plasma drug concentration curve. However, the AUC of the drug permeated after in vitro lipolysis displayed a good correlation with the in vivo AUC (R2 > 0.9). Thus, it was concluded that the in vitro lipolysis-mucus-PVPA permeation model, simulating the physiological digestion and absorption processes, was able to predict in vivo absorption data, exhibiting great potential for further prediction of in vivo performance of SNEDDSs.","Falavigna, Margherita; Klitgaard, Mette; Berthelsen, Ragna; Müllertz, Anette; Flaten, Gøril Eide",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.08.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916137/,36

Within this context, phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference has become a popular method to study disease transmission. In a Bayesian context, these approaches have the benefit of accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty, and popular implementations provide the possibility to parameterize the transition rates between locations as a function of epidemiological and ecological data to reconstruct spatial spread while simultaneously identifying the main factors impacting the spatial spread dynamics. Recent developments enable researchers to make use of travel history data of infected individuals in the reconstruction of pathogen spread, offering increased inference accuracy and mitigating sampling bias. Here, we describe a detailed workflow to reconstruct the spatial spread of a pathogen through Bayesian phylogeographic analysis in discrete space using these novel approaches, implemented in BEAST.

Moreover, there have also been few reports in which the preventive factors were examined in patients with or without malignant disease histories requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study. A total of 1003 post-PCI patients were divided into a malignant group, with current or past malignant disease, and a nonmalignant group. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and admission due to heart failure within 5 years of PCI. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly higher probability of the primary endpoint in the malignant group (P = .002). Multivariable Cox hazard analyses showed that in patients without a history of malignant, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of dyslipidemia were independent and significant negative predictors of the primary endpoint (BMI: hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.99, P = .041; prevalence of dyslipidemia: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, P = .048), and the presence of multi-vessel disease (MVD) and the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were independent and significant positive predictors of the primary endpoint (prevalence of MVD: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.18-2.40, P = .004; prevalence of PAD: HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03-2.21, P = .034).

158385,Abstract Listing.,2017,"At the end of 2019, in Wuhan, the Hubei Province's capital city in China, the first cases of COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were described. The rapid spread of the infection through the world resulted in the World Health Organization announcing the COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. The main routes of transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to current evidence, are via droplets inhalation, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, and transmission via the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes, and probably through airborne particles from the respiratory tract, generated during coughing and sneezing of infected individuals. During the pulmonary function testing (PFTs), which require strenuous breathing maneuvers and generate high-intensity airflow, aerosols, and micro-aerosols are formed from respiratory secretions and may contain viral and bacterial particles. Therefore, such forced respiratory maneuvers pose a significant risk of spreading the infection to patients and laboratory staff. According to current knowledge, the source of infection may also be an asymptomatic and a pre-symptomatic individual. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly prevalent in the community, and this increases a potential risk to all patients tested lung function and staff working there. As the patients' and staff's safety is of unprecedented importance, the additional precautions when performing pulmonary function tests are necessary and unquestionable. In consequence, the greater availability of consumables and personal protective equipment is indispensable. The reorganization of daily practice will prolong test time, reduce the number of tests performed, and slow down patients' flow. The guidance provides practical advice to health care professionals on performing pulmonary function tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been developed basing on currently available information and recommendations from relevant health care institutions. As the COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and the new scientific data has been becoming are available, the guidance will be updated over time.","Franczuk, Monika; Przybyłowski, Tadeusz; Czajkowska-Malinowska, Małgorzata; Radliński, Jakub; Bochenek, Grażyna; Wesołowski, Stefan; Sliwiński, Paweł",Advances in respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2020.0186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393664/,36

METHODS This single-center, ambispective cohort study compared 122 consecutive patients (mean age 66.7 years) with unilateral versus bilateral PAE from March 2009 to December 2011. Selective PAE was performed with 100- and 200-μm nonspherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles by a unilateral femoral approach. RESULTS Bilateral PAE was performed in 103 (84.4 %) patients (group A). The remaining 19 (15.6 %) patients underwent unilateral PAE (group B). Mean follow-up time was 6.7 months in group A and 7.3 months in group B. Mean prostate volume, PSA, International prostate symptom score/quality of life (IPSS/QoL) and post-void residual volume (PVR) reduction, and peak flow rate (Qmax) improvement were 19.4 mL, 1.68 ng/mL, 11.8/2.0 points, 32.9 mL, and 3.9 mL/s in group A and 11.5 mL, 1.98 ng/mL, 8.9/1.4 points, 53.8 mL, and 4.58 mL/s in group B. Poor clinical outcome was observed in 24.3 % of patients from group A and 47.4 % from group B (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS PAE is a safe and effective technique that can induce 48 % improvement in the IPSS score and a prostate volume reduction of 19 %, with good clinical outcome in up to 75 % of treated patients. Bilateral PAE seems to lead to better clinical results; however, up to 50 % of patients after unilateral PAE may have a good clinical outcome.","Bilhim, Tiago; Pisco, João; Rio Tinto, Hugo; Fernandes, Lúcia; Campos Pinheiro, Luís; Duarte, Marisa; Pereira, José A; Oliveira, António G; O'Neill, João",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0528-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23232858/,36

Current enrichment-based technologies provide cheap but low-resolution and relative enrichment of 5hmC levels, while single-base resolution methods can be prohibitively expensive to scale up to large experiments. To address this problem, we developed a deep learning-based method, ""DeepH&M,"" which integrates enrichment and restriction enzyme sequencing methods to simultaneously estimate absolute hydroxymethylation and methylation levels at single-CpG resolution. Using 7-week-old mouse cerebellum data for training the DeepH&M model, we demonstrated that the 5hmC and 5mC levels predicted by DeepH&M were in high concordance with whole-genome bisulfite-based approaches. The DeepH&M model can be applied to 7-week-old frontal cortex and 79-week-old cerebellum, revealing the robust generalizability of this method to other tissues from various biological time points.","He, Yu; Jang, Hyo Sik; Xing, Xiaoyun; Li, Daofeng; Vasek, Michael J; Dougherty, Joseph D; Wang, Ting",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba0521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937429/,36

However, recirculation of blood oxygenated by ECMO back into the circuit may occur in VVECMO, resulting in insufficient oxygenation. The cannula position and bypass flow rate are two major factors influencing recirculation, but the relationship and ideal configuration of these factors are not fully understood. In the present study, we attempted to clarify these parameters for effective gas exchange. VVECMO was performed in eight adult goats under general anesthesia. The position of the drainage cannula was fixed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), but the return cannula position was varied between the IVC, right atrium (RA), and superior vena cava (SVC). At each position, the recirculation rates calculated, and the adequacy of oxygen delivery by ECMO in supplying systemic oxygen demand was assessed by measuring the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and pressure (PaO2). Although the recirculation rates increased as the bypass flow rates increased, SaO2 and PaO2 also increased in any position of return cannula. The recirculation rates and PaO2 were 27 ± 2% and 162 ± 16 mmHg, 36 ± 6% and 139 ± 11 mmHg, and 63 ± 6% and 77 ± 9 mmHg in the SVC, RA and IVC position at 4 L/min respectively. In conclusion, the best return cannula position was the SVC, and a high bypass flow rate was advantageous for effective oxygenation. Both the bypass flow rates and cannula position must be considered to achieve effective oxygenation.","Togo, Konomi; Takewa, Yoshiaki; Katagiri, Nobumasa; Fujii, Yutaka; Kishimoto, Satoru; Date, Kazuma; Miyamoto, Yuji; Tatsumi, Eisuke",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-014-0810-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25477271/,36

The Department of Family and Social Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center rapidly and strategically reconfigured clinical services to meet the needs of patients, communities, and the health system. CLINICAL RECONFIGURATION Family medicine hospitalist services tripled in size within 2 weeks to cover 71 beds and cared for 447 patients between March 24 and June 10, 2020, of whom 279 (62.4%) had COVID-19. Community health centers reorganized to maintain primary care services, shifting abruptly to telemedicine while maintaining 95% of the previous year's visit volume, and address intensified patient needs related to viral infection and mental health impacts. Core principles for redeployment included role flexibility, communication, responsiveness, and safety and wellness. DISCUSSION During a pandemic surge, academic family medicine departments have an important role in expanding hospitalist services and redesigning primary care services. The ability to reconfigure work to meet unprecedented demands on health care was facilitated by family medicine's broad scope of practice including training in hospital medicine, interpersonal communication, behavioral health, care across settings, collaborative partnerships with specialists, and adaptability to communities' needs.","Flattau, Anna; Cristallo, Jessica; Duggan, Mary; Gbur, Maria; Fabienne Daguilh, Marie-Louise; Selwyn, Peter",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088805/,36

With the ongoing research in next-generation networking (NGN), the use of secure and reliable communication and networking is of utmost importance when dealing with users' health records and other sensitive information. Through the adaptation of artificial-intelligence-enabled NGN, the shape of healthcare systems can be altered to achieve smart and secure healthcare capable of coping with epidemics that may emerge at any given moment. In this article, we envision a cooperative and distributed healthcare framework that relies on state-of-the-art computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities, namely, federated learning, mobile edge computing, and blockchain, to enable epidemic (or suspicious infectious disease) discovery, remote monitoring, and fast health authority response. The introduced framework can also enable secure medical data exchange at the edge and between different health entities. This technique, coupled with the low latency and high bandwidth functionality of 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass surveillance, monitoring, and analysis to occur at the edge.

Methods: Staff and faculty responded to an email invitation to complete an online survey. Survey questions included demographic data (race/ethnicity, age, sex), COVID-19 knowledge and behaviors, employment specific data including division and subdivision (healthcare vs. non-healthcare related division); and self-reported vaccination status. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine significant characteristics associated with the likelihood of being unvaccinated for COVID-19. Results: Participants identifying as Asian and Asian American, Hispanic/Latinx or Multicultural/Other had greater odds of being unvaccinated compared to Non-Hispanic White participants. Other characteristics associated with greater likelihood of being unvaccinated included working as university staff member (vs. faculty), older age, decrease in income, inability to work remotely and not traveling outside of Los Angeles area. Political affiliation as an Independent or as something else were more likely to be unvaccinated compared to participants identifying as Democrat.

164979,Is Antibody-Dependent Enhancement a cause for COVID Vaccine Hesitancy,2021,"Viral protease plays an essential role in viral replication and maturation. Therefore, the enzyme active site is an attractive target for the antiviral agents. The “picornavirus-like supercluster” proteases are chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteases associated with viruses in the families Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. They contain catalytic residues for proteolysis activity in their active sites, to cleave viral proteins during their replication. In this chapter, we describe the procedure of virtual screening for specific molecules targeting feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a variant of feline coronavirus (FCoV), protease (FIPV 3CLpro), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV 3Cpro). The study of FIPV 3CLpro can be a model for other emerging coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 while the methods related to FMDV 3Cpro can also be a useful guide for other picornaviruses. The small and active natural molecules were retrieved from available compound libraries. Several software and web servers are freely accessible for academics to perform in silico assay that narrow down the compound-searching scope for further validation in antiviral drug development.","Theerawatanasirikul, S.; Lekcharoensuk, P.",Methods Pharmacol.

For small companies, there are the potential benefits of increased efficiencies and market share gain, associated with the re-engineering of selling and marketing processes;but in developing countries, such as Nigeria, research into how small businesses are using e-business systems and technologies is limited. This article builds upon earlier case study research in the Nigerian small business sector to develop a framework for e-business strategy development, implementation and review. Using an inductive approach, data was collected from six small businesses, using interviews and questionnaires, to profile the e-business operations of these companies. This study found that e-business strategy was generally lacking in these companies, but interview material was used to support the development and validation of the strategy framework, which provides a process and a checklist for small businesses pursuing e-business initiatives in developing world environments.","Wynn, Martin Olakunle Olayinka",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137356,36

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that RUTF made with reduced amounts of linoleic acid, achieved using high oleic (HO) peanuts, with or without added DHA, improves cognition when compared to standard RUTF (S-RUTF). Methods: A triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical feeding trial was conducted among children with uncomplicated SAM in Malawi with 3 types of RUTF; DHA-HO- RUTF, HO-RUTF and S-RUTF. The primary outcomes, measured in a subset of subjects, were the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) global and 4 domain (gross motor, fine motor, language and social) z-scores and a modified Willatts problem solving assessment (PSA) intention score for 3 standardized problems, measured 6 months and immediately after completing RUTF therapy, respectively. Plasma fatty acid content, anthropometry and eye tracking were secondary outcomes. Comparisons were made between the novel PUFA RUTFs and S-RUTF. Results: Among the 2565 SAM children enrolled, global MDAT z-score was -0.69 {+/-} 1.19 and -0.88 {+/-} 1.27 for children receiving DHA-HO-RUTF and S-RUTF, respectively (difference 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38). The gross motor and social domains had higher z-scores among children receiving either DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF. The PSA problem 3 scores did not differ by dietary group (Odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.26 for DHA-HO-RUTF). After 4 weeks of treatment, plasma phospholipid EPA and a- linolenic acid were greater in children consuming DHA-HO-RUTF or HO-RUTF when compared to S-RUTF (for all 4 comparisons P values < 0.001), but only plasma DHA was greater in DHA-HO-RUTF than S-RUTF ( P <0.001). Conclusions: Treatment of uncomplicated SAM with DHA-HO-RUTF resulted in an improved MDAT score, conferring a cognitive benefit six months after completing diet therapy. This treatment should be explored in operational settings.","Stephenson, K.; Callaghan-Gillespie, M.; Maleta, K.; Nkhoma, M.; George, M.; Park, H. G.; Lee, R.; Humphries-Cuff, I.; Lacombe, R. J.

Here, we report that negative-strand RNA paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Measles virus (MeV), can also trigger the cGAS/STING axis. While mice deficient for MyD88, TRIF and MAVS still moderately control NiV infection when compared to WT mice, additional STING deficiency resulted in 100% lethality, suggesting synergistic roles of these pathways in host protection. Moreover, deletion of cGAS or STING resulted in decreased type-I interferon production with enhanced paramyxoviral infection in both human and murine cells. Finally, the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of STING, observed during viral infections, confirmed the activation of cGAS/STING pathway by NiV and MeV. Our data suggest that cGAS/STING activation is critical in controlling paramyxovirus infection, and possibly represent attractive targets to develop countermeasures against severe disease induced by these pathogens.","Iampietro, Mathieu; Dumont, Claire; Mathieu, Cyrille; Spanier, Julia; Robert, Jonathan; Charpenay, Aude; Dupichaud, Sébastien; Dhondt, Kévin P.; Aurine, Noémie; Pelissier, Rodolphe; Ferren, Marion; Mély, Stéphane; Gerlier, Denis; Kalinke, Ulrich; Horvat, Branka",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424443,36

Initially, we intended to evaluate typical day-to-day factors, however we ended up capturing these factors during the unique environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted an exploratory cross-sectional survey at an EMS agency in northeast Texas in November 2020. Surveys were web-based and anonymous. They included the ProQOL 5, the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, the Brief Resilience Survey, the RAND Social Support Survey Instrument, the Kessler-6, the Workplace Incivility Scale-Revised, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Brief Cope Scale. Results The survey had a response rate of 19% (38 participants). Findings suggest a positive relationship between utilising religion as a coping mechanism and higher compassion satisfaction. There was also a relationship associated between increased perceived organisational support leading to an increase in compassion satisfaction. The most significant predictors of burnout were two different coping mechanisms. Those who relied more heavily on behavioral disengagement and those who employed humour as a coping mechanism displayed average increased levels of burnout. Finally, those who experienced workplace incivility and those who relied on self-blame as a coping mechanism experienced on average higher levels of secondary traumatic stress. Conclusion This study adds to the limited literature examining coping mechanisms, stress and burnout in EMS personnel. It is also unique for examining how EMS personnel are coping with stress during a prolonged pandemic. © 2021, Paramedics Australasia. All rights reserved.","Miller, A.; Brown, L.

Occupational hand dermatitis is a relatively common but challenging issue that imposes a negative effect on the quality of life, work performance, and adherence to hygiene principles. We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the psychosocial impacts of hand dermatitis on healthcare workers (HCWs) using an online Persian version of the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002). Sixty-three from a total of 390 HCWs (21%) reported that hand eczema had adverse effects on their occupation, such as a necessity to use gloves (17.3%) and decreased adherence to hand hygiene (14%). HCWs reported a higher exacerbation of hand dermatitis in winter (40.3%) and fall (24.7%). Hand dermatitis exerted a significant impact on sporting activities, sleep, social life, mood, and sex in 17.7%, 43.3%, 44.3%, 66%, and 11.7% of HCWs, respectively.

At baseline, mean age was 49.6 years (S.D. = 16.9), 80% female, 88.3% White, with an annual household income of ≥ $60,000 (57.6%), type 2 diabetes (T2D;301,13.9%), 145 prediabetes (145, 6.6%) and type 1 (T1D, 100, 4.6%). One-third (29.7%) reported decreased income due to the pandemic. T2Ds had more medical comorbidities and COVID risk factors than T1Ds and NDs (all p < 0.01). Mean PHQ-8 scores were 7.1 (S.D. = 5.8;mild), with the T2Ds (M = 7.7;S.D. = 5.9) exceeding NDs (M = 6.9;S.D. = 5.7;p<.001). Mean DDS-17 and GAD-7 scores were comparable for T1Ds and T2Ds (moderate level;p=NS). At 6 months (6MFU), 1,345 (62.6%) completed follow up surveys. Completers were more likely to be older, male, White, married, with higher education levels, and homeowners, with a greater proportion of medical comorbidities and lower A1cs at baseline than non-completers (all p<.05). 6MFU completers had lower baseline depressive symptoms and diabetes distress, lower household COVID-19 rates and less difficulty paying bills than non-completers (all p<.05). At 6MFU for all groups, depressive symptoms decreased (p<.0001) and financial strain improved (p<.001), while COVID exposure increased (personal and household, p<.001). Diabetes distress remained at a moderate level for T1Ds and T2Ds. T1Ds and T2Ds showed comparable levels of depressive symptoms to NDs but were more likely to report financial hardship (p<.05) and difficulty paying bills than NDs (p<.001). Health outcomes were worse for PWDs compared to NDs during the COVID-19 pandemic despite high SES protective factors. Persistent financial strain and diabetes distress increase the risk for future poor health outcomes.","Myers, Barbara A.; Klingensmith, Rachel De Groot Mary",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-5-or,36

Clinical use is primarily limited to prophylaxis due to delayed second-cycle parasite death at 1-3 μM serum concentrations. DOX concentrations >5 μM kill parasites with first-cycle activity but have been ascribed to off-target mechanisms outside the apicoplast. We report that 10 μM DOX blocks apicoplast biogenesis in the first cycle and is rescued by isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential apicoplast product, confirming an apicoplast-specific mechanism. Exogenous iron rescues parasites and apicoplast biogenesis from first-but not second-cycle effects of 10 μM DOX, revealing that first-cycle activity involves a metal-dependent mechanism distinct from the delayed-death mechanism. These results critically expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX and suggest repurposing DOX as a faster-acting antimalarial at higher dosing whose multiple mechanisms would be expected to limit parasite resistance.","Okada, Megan; Guo, Ping; Nalder, Shai-anne; Sigala, Paul A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.146407,36

We found that the parameters'/biomarkers' ability to discriminate between the infected and the uninfected state varied over the observation time period. Consistently over time, the concentration of cytokines in nasal lavage fluid showed moderate to very good discrimination performance, thereby qualifying for disease progression monitoring.

Shortly after the pandemic outbreak several machine learning algorithms have been implemented to assess new diagnostic and therapeutic methods for this disease. Aim of this study is to assess gas-trointestinal and liver related predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 associated risk of hospitalization. Methods: Data collection was based on questionnaire from the COVID-19 outpatient test center and from the emergency department at the University hospital in combination with data from inter-nal hospital information system and from the mobile application used for telemedicine follow-up of patients. For statistical analysis SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were considered as controls to three different SARS-CoV-2 positive patient groups (divided based on severity of the disease). Results: Total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. Presence of diarrhea and nausea was significantly higher in emergency department group than in the COVID-19 outpatient test center. Among liver enzymes only aspartate transaminase (AST) has been significantly elevated in the hospitalized group compared to patients discharged home. Based on random forest algorithm, AST has been identified as the most important predictor followed by age or diabetes mellitus. Diarrhea and bloating have also predictive importance although much lower than AST. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 positivity is connected with isolated AST elevation and the level is linked with the severity of the disease. Furthermore, using machine learning random forest algo-rithm, we have identified elevated AST as the most important predictor for COVID-19 related hos-pitalizations.","Liptak, P.; Banovcin, P.; Rosolanka, R.; Prokopic, M.; Kocan, I.; Ziacikova, I.; Uhrik, P.; Grendar, M.; Hyrdel, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.27.21262728v1?rss=1,36

Their number, size and sequence diversity are essential characteristics of B-cell populations. Identifying clones in B-cell populations is central to several repertoire studies such as statistical analysis, repertoire comparisons, and clonal tracking. Several clonal grouping methods have been developed to group sequences from B-cell immune repertoires. Such methods have been principally evaluated on simulated benchmarks since experimental data containing clonally related sequences can be difficult to obtain. However, experimental data might contains multiple sources of sequence variability hampering their artificial reproduction. Therefore, the generation of high precision ground truth data that preserves real repertoire distributions is necessary to accurately evaluate clonal grouping methods. Results We proposed a novel methodology to generate ground truth data sets from real repertoires. Our procedure requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial clones, and iteratively apply an optimisation step that moves sequences among clones to increase their cohesion and separation. We first showed that our method was able to identify clonally-related sequences in simulated repertoires with higher mutation rates, accurately. Next, we demonstrated how real benchmarks (generated by our method) constitute a challenge for clonal grouping methods, when comparing the performance of a widely used clonal grouping algorithm on several generated benchmarks. Our method can be used to generate a high number of benchmarks and contribute to construct more accurate clonal grouping tools.

Results: Twenty-one patients filled out the questionnaire half of whom were females. Most of the patients had lung cancer and were on pembrolizumab. All the patients interviewed developed at least one new symptom after the change in the dose was introduced. The most frequent symptoms reported were itchy skin and fatigue and they were severely experienced. However, very few of the symptoms experienced required a physician consult or hospitalization. Most of the participants welcomed the change in the dose to protect them from COVID-19 and were mainly indifferent as to whether they get the low dose more frequently or the higher dose less frequently. Conclusions: This study has highlighted the frequency and severity of irAEs with the use of extended dosing schedule of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Future research should have more patients to validate thisoutcome and look for the causes behind the increased incidence and severity of irAEs with higher dose less frequent intervals of these immunotherapies.","Abdelsalam, M.; Sughayar, R.; Myers, G.; Avileli, M.; Salem, M.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.e14550,36

Not only for coping with that situation but also with the adaption of digital technologies in general, educational service providers (ESP) become paramount. ESPs need to offer contemporary and innovative services which should serve the aim of gaining and even improving the learning outcomes. Furthermore, ESPs can take the heat off teachers who suffer under an increased workload. To address this issue, we conducted a literature review focusing on papers which covered educational service concepts that effect learning outcomes. The results are clustered by the groups of digital learning formats which in turn are transferred from the 2020 classification framework of digital learning formats by the mmb institute. Besides giving an overview of the current state of research, we demonstrate the research gap and recommendations for further research when referring to the role and service portfolio of ESPs. © 2021 IEEE.","Heim, S.; Drieschner, C.; Wittges, H.; Krcmar, H.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/educon46332.2021.9453882,36

Children are at particular risk of adverse effects during development, which may impact on health in later life. Interventions that improve air quality are therefore urgently needed not only to improve public health now, but to prevent longer-term increased vulnerability to chronic disease. Low Emission Zones are a public health policy intervention aimed at reducing traffic-derived contributions to urban air pollution, but evidence that they deliver clear health benefits is lacking. We established a natural experiment design study (CHILL: Children's Health in London and Luton) to evaluate the impacts of the introduction of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) on childrens health. Methods and analysis: CHILL is a prospective two-arm parallel longitudinal cohort study of children aged 6-9 years, attending primary schools in Central London (the focus of the first phase of the ULEZ) and Luton (a comparator site). The primary goal of the study is to examine the impact of changes in annual air pollutant exposures as oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5microns and 10microns (NOx, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 respectively) across the two sites on lung growth, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), over four consecutive years. Secondary outcomes being investigated include a range of respiratory health indicators as well as inequality and health economic measures.

This work provides empirical evidence to test organizational resilience to deal with turbulent environments by studying firms' performance in unconventional oil and gas development in North America and Latin America. The 2014–2015 and 2019–2020 hydrocarbon price collapse allow us to measure resilience potential based on the organizational recovery after suffering a disruptive event. Only in the US, oil and gas output increased 10 million barrels of equivalent oil per day, despite high costs, low returns, and growing funding needs. Companies had to innovate, adapt, and manage uncertainty to optimize production, reduce costs and risk exposure, and generate positive cash flows. The fragile disappeared, the robust and resilient survived, and the antifragile thrived. This paper aims to define customary indicators to measure organizations' resilience after an extreme event. It also provides a scale that offers an approach to rank organizations and contrasts the most distinctive managerial attributes for successful and failed companies to deal with uncertain environments.","Bravo, Oscar Hernández Diego",Energy Research &amp; Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2021.102187,36
182434,Cohort Study: The Accuracy of Screening Methods of COVID-19 in Pregnancy: Practical Approach in Low Resources Health Services,2021-09-26,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional spill overs into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are co-incident in the Middle East and a rapid way is required of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are co-infections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterise these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, we developed an amplicon-based approach coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified – which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated on clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole genome or near whole genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants including deletion mutants. Whereas, the metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome.","Aljabr, Waleed; Alruwaili, Muhannad; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Alrezaihi, Abdulrahman; Harrison, Abbie Jasmine; Ryan, Yan; Bentley, Eleanor; Jones, Benjamin; Alhatlani, Bader Y.; AlShahrani, Dayel; Mahmood, Zana; Rickett, Natasha J.; Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Alamri, Saad; Alsran, Hadel; Hamed, Maaweya; Dong, Xiaofeng; Assiri, Abdullah; Alrasheed, Abdullah R.; Hamza, Muaawia; Carroll, Miles W.; Gemmell, Matthew; Darby, Alistair; Donovan-Banfield, I’ah; Stewart, James P.; Matthews, David A.; Davidson, Andrew D.; Hiscox, Julian A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.28.400671,36
182698,Predicting multimodal MRI outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental conditions following MRI simulator training,2021-01-30,"Background: Despite significant improvement in the RA management, up to twenty percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a difficult-to-treat (D2T) disease. The COVID-19 related mitigation policies, for instance quarantine, and consequent difficult access to in-person visits, laboratory and imaging investigations, adversely affected the follow up of rheumatic patients. Although pandemic-imposed limitations could have negatively influenced disease management particularly in D2T patients, to what degree these restrictions affected the treat-to target (T2T) and tight-control strategy in this subgroup of RA patients has not been investigated yet. Objectives: To evaluate whether the switch to telehealth imposed by COVID-19 pandemic was effective in the management of D2T RA patients treated with targeted therapies. Methods: This observational retrospective real-life study was conducted from November 2019 through September 2020. Among RA patients treated with targeted therapies, RA D2T patients according to EULAR definition (1) were identified. Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of these patients was analysed retrospectively before, during and after lockdown (LD). During LD period, patients could choose whether to receive home drug delivery or to maintain their face-to-face consultations, and in the former rheumatologists provided virtual care. To evaluate the effect of LD on the percentage of patients in remission, logistic mixed effects regression models were fitted, with CDAI remission as response variable. Results: Data were extracted from a longitudinal observational registry, and at baseline, 52 patients treated with targeted therapies were classified as D2T RA. Among them, during pre-LD, LD, and post-LD 11.54% (N=6), 53.49% (N=23), and 46.15% (N=24) had CDAI remission/low disease activity, while 46 (88.46%), 20 (46.51%) and 28 (53.85%) had CDAI moderate/high. All the patients completed the follow-up. Median values of CDAI during pre-LD, LD, and post-LD were 14.5 [IQR 12-21], 9 [IQR 5.5-16], and 11 [IQR 6-19.2] respectively (see Figure 1 below). Conclusion: Telephone-based tight control strategy ensured satisfactory management of D2T RA treated with targeted therapies. This temporary approach has been a feasible compensation for the decline of face-to-face visits also in this challenging group of RA patients, thus reassuring for future months before the end of pandemic.","Ingegnoli, F.; Luppino, A.

182920,COVAX Statement on WHO emergency use listing for AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine,2021-04-11,"Although burnout is a widely studied topic, there is still much to learn about this symptom during a pandemic crisis like the one caused by COVID-19. Moreover, and according to the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory, the relation between personal resources and burnout is still an understudied topic. The main goal of this research is to understand the influence of mental resilience on the three dimensions of burnout-emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal achievement-among healthcare workers when exposed to a pandemic situation. A cross-sectional study was conducted based on the administration of an online survey to a sample of 196 healthcare workers (nurses and doctors) during the second wave of COVID-19 in Portugal. Hypotheses were tested using Partial Least Squares. The results show that during a pandemic situation, higher levels of resilience associated both with lower levels of emotional exhaustion (Emotional Exhaustion: −0.17;95% Confidence Interval–CI: −0.38, 0.04) and depersonalization (Depersonalization: −0.17;95% CI: −0.31, −0.03), and higher levels of personal achievement (Personal Achievement: 0.50;95% CI: 0.40, 0.61). Resilience should be considered an important asset for reducing levels of burnout when facing highly stressing situations. The main contribution of this research is related to the role of personal resources as an inhibitor of negative consequences of job strain, such as burnout. The findings add new knowledge to the topic of fighting (not just understanding) burnout in deeply stressful situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforcing the importance of developing personal resources. Resilience skills may be developed, thus reducing the risk of burnout.","Ferreira, Pedro Gomes Sofia",Social Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10090317,36

183391,"Bone Infections, Sinusitis, Antihypertensive Therapy and COVID-19, Toilet Training, Amenorrhea.",2020-06-15,"Type I (-α, β) and type III (-λ) interferons (IFNs) are produced in response to virus infection and upregulate a largely overlapping set of IFN stimulated genes which mediate the protective effects of these antiviral cytokines. In vitro studies have demonstrated the redundancy of these two cytokine families which activate the same transcription factor, IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), via distinct ligands and receptors. However, in vivo, these IFN types do have distinct functions based on receptor distribution, but also ligand availability. Using a newly generated IFN-λ reporter mouse strain we have observed that both type I and type III IFNs are produced in response to respiratory tract infection by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and influenza A virus (IAV). In the case of NDV these IFNs are synthesized by different cell types. Type I IFNs are produced primarily by alveolar macrophages, type III IFNs are made only by epithelial cells, and production of either is dependent on MAVS. While epithelial cells of the respiratory tract represent the primary target of IAV infection, we found that they did not significantly contribute to IFN-λ production, and IFN-λ protein levels were largely unaffected in the absence of MAVS. Instead we found that pDCs, a cell type known for robust IFN-α production via TLR/MyD88 signaling, were the major producers of IFN-λ during IAV infection, with pDC depletion during influenza infection resulting in significantly reduced levels of both IFN-α and IFN-λ. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that pDCs rely on type I IFN for optimal IFN-λ production. These studies therefore demonstrate that the in vivo producers of Type III IFNs in response to respiratory virus infection are pathogen dependent, a finding which may explain the varying levels of cytokine production induced by different viral pathogens.","Sandoval, Marvin J.; Tseng, Hsiang-Chi; Risman, Heidi P.; Smirnov, Sergey; Li, Qing; Lin, Jian-Da; Rivera, Amariliz; Durbin, Russell K.; Kotenko, Sergei V.; Durbin, Joan E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.05.463160,36

The neglect in managing NCDs during emergencies may result in fatal consequences for individuals living with comorbidities. This paper aims to highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the governance of public health emergencies to simultaneously address NCD and noncommunicable disease (CD) pandemics while taking into account the needs of high-risk populations, underlying etiological factors, and the social, economic, and environmental determinants that are relevant for both CDs and NCDs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the available global frameworks for pandemic preparedness to highlight the governance challenges of addressing the dual agenda of NCDs and CDs during a public health emergency. It proposes key strategies to strengthen multilevel governance in support of countries to better prepare for public health emergencies through the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders across sectors. Findings: Addressing both CD and NCD pandemics during public health emergencies requires (1) a new framework that unites the narratives and overcomes service and system fragmentations;(2) a multisectoral and multistakeholder governance mechanism empowered and resourced to include stakeholders across sectors and (3) a prioritized research agenda to understand the political economy of pandemics, the role played by different political systems and actors and implementation challenges, and to identify combined strategies to address the converging agendas of CDs and NCDs. Research limitations/implications: The article is based on the review of available published evidence. Practical implications: The uptake of the strategies proposed will better prepare countries to respond to NCD and CD pandemics during public health emergencies.

The intestinal epithelium has an important role in effector responses, which is coordinated by immune-type specific cytokines. It is incompletely understood how cytokines drive epithelial responses. Here, using organoid-cytokine co-cultures, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how key cytokines affect the intestinal epithelium, and relate this to in vivo infection models. We use imaging, based on a convolutional neural network, and transcriptomic analysis to reveal that cytokines use developmental pathways to define intestinal epithelial effector responses. For example, we find IL-22 and IL-13 dichotomously induce goblet cells, in which only IL-13 driven goblet cells are associated with NOTCH signaling. We further show that IL-13 induces BMP signalling to act as a negative feedback loop in IL-13 induced tuft cell hyperplasia, an important aspect of type 2 immunity. Together, we show that targeting developmental pathways may be a useful tool to tailor epithelial effector responses that are necessary for immunity to infection.","Lindholm, Håvard T.; Parmar, Naveen; Drurey, Claire; Ostrop, Jenny; Díez-Sanchez, Alberto; Maizels, Rick M.; Oudhoff, Menno J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.160747,36

188109,Communicating Through COVID-19: Keeping Patients Connected to Loved Ones.,2020-09-01,"The 21.7-kb replicase locus of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) encodes several putative functional domains, including three proteinase domains. Encoded closest to the 5' terminus of this locus is the first papain-like proteinase (PLP-1) (S. C. Baker et al., J. Virol. 67:6056-6063, 1993; H.-J. Lee et al., Virology 180:567-582, 1991). This cysteine proteinase is responsible for the in vitro cleavage of p28, a polypeptide that is also present in MHV-A59-infected cells. Cleavage at a second site was recently reported for this proteinase (P. J. Bonilla et al., Virology 209:489-497, 1995). This new cleavage site maps to the same region as the predicted site of the C terminus of p65, a viral polypeptide detected in infected cells. In this study, microsequencing analysis of the radiolabeled downstream cleavage product and deletion mutagenesis analysis were used to identify the scissile bond of the second cleavage site to between Ala832 and Gly833. The effects of mutations between the P5 and P2' positions on the processing at the second cleavage site were analyzed. Most substitutions at the P4, P3, P2, and P2' positions were permissive for cleavage. With the exceptions of a conservative P1 mutation, Ala832Gly, and a conservative P5 mutation, Arg828Lys, substitutions at the P5, P1, and P1' positions severely diminished second-site proteolysis. Mutants in which the p28 cleavage site (Gly247 / Val248) was replaced by the Ala832 / Gly833 cleavage site and vice versa were found to retain processing activity. Contrary to previous reports, we determined that the PLP-1 has the ability to process in trans at either the p28 site or both cleavage sites, depending on the choice of substrate. The results from this study suggest a greater role by the PLP-1 in the processing of the replicase locus in vivo.","Bonilla, P J; Hughes, S A; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995606/,36

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of eight patients underwent a RPDG using the E･Z Access™/LAPPROTECTOR™ (Hakko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) oval type devices with POP by a single surgeon. The median age of the patients was 66 years (range 48-75 years), and their median BMI was 22.3 kg/m2 (range 17.7-26.8 kg/m2). One (12.5 %) of eight patients was female. A thin caliber trocar MiniPort™ (Covidien, New Haven, CT) was inserted at the left upper quadrant by puncture without incision. An assistant used Endo Relief™ (Hope Denshi Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan) needlescopic forceps. In three cases, the pre-bent forceps (KTY-I, Adachi Industry Co. Ltd., Gifu, Japan) was introduced for surgeon's left hand. After the liver was retracted with a 2-0 Prolene suture, a distal subtotal resection of the stomach with D1+ or D2 lymph node dissection was performed. The Roux-en-Y method or Billroth-I anastomosis was used for reconstruction. The short-term patient outcomes were investigated to evaluate the feasibility of RPDG with POP. RESULTS We employed this technique without the use of additional trocars in every patient except one. No conversion to laparotomy was observed. Both the Endo Relief™ forceps and prebent forceps were useful to maintain countertraction and keep triangulation. The median length of the operation was 374 (range, 268-420) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss was 45 (range, 5-180) ml. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was 32 (range 22-46). Neither major postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, nor postoperative mortality were observed. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1,5 days. The umbilical wound was indistinct. CONCLUSION RPDG with POP using a needlescopic device procedure is feasible in terms of patient safety and curability.","Shibao, Kazunori; Matayoshi, Nobutaka; Sato, Norihiro; Higure, Aiichiro",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054996/,36

189176,COVID-19 - A Kidney Perspective.,2020-09-04,"Studies of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), suggest that a 69 nt-long packaging signal, which is located about 20 kb from the 5'-end of the 31 kb-long MHV genomic RNA, is necessary and sufficient for MHV genomic RNA packaging into MHV particles. We demonstrated that use of a low pH culture medium combined with subsequent ultrafiltration increased MHV infectivity about 60 times over MHV preparations grown in neutral medium. Using this virus concentration procedure, we successfully prepared DI particle-rich MHV preparations. Characterization of virus samples released from the cells infected with DI particle-rich MHV revealed that infectious MHV genomic RNA was not required for packaging of DI RNAs. These data suggested that interaction of the DI packaging signal with an unidentified region(s) of helper virus genomic RNA is unlikely, and therefore unlikely to facilitate the packaging of MHV DI RNA into the MHV virion. Rather, both DI RNA and MHV genomic RNA probably use the packaging signal for RNA packaging.","Kim, K H; Narayanan, K; Makino, S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782302/,36

In view of the lack of consistent data on the economic losses caused by IB and the poor protection resulting from the use of the Massachusetts type as a live vaccine in Brazil, this survey aimed to estimate the losses per 1000 birds in broiler and breeder flocks positive for IBV. Thirty-two different IBV genetic types were found. In breeders, the total loss per 1,000 birds was US $3567.4 and US $4210.8 at 25-26 and 42 weeks old, respectively, whereas in broilers (48 days old), the estimated loss was US $266.3 per 1,000 birds. Taken together, the results show a significant and measurable economic impact on the broiler and breeder industries, with an age-dependent increasing trend and an association with multiple genetic types of the virus.","Colvero, L P; Villarreal, L Y B; Torres, C A; Brañdo, P E",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044167/,36

Several studies have demonstrated that viral infections may provoke asthma. Bacterial infections seem to play a minor role. However, Chlamydia pneumoniae has been recently reported as a possible cause of asthma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of C. pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of asthma in adults. Seventy four adult out-patients with a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma were studied. Acute and convalescent (> or = 3 weeks) serological determination of antibodies to cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 and 3, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila were performed by means of immunofluorescence tests. C. pneumoniae specific antibodies were detected by two microimmunofluorescence tests using a specific antigen (TW-183) and a kit with three chlamydial antigens. Pharyngeal swab specimens were also obtained for C. pneumoniae identification. Samples for bacterial culture were obtained in patients with productive cough (15 out of 74 patients). Fifteen patients (20%) presented seroconversion to at least one of the studied pathogens. Seven were found to be infected by virus, six by C. pneumoniae alone, and one by M. pneumoniae. One more patient showed seroconversion to C. pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Allegra, L; Blasi, F; Centanni, S; Cosentini, R; Denti, F; Raccanelli, R; Tarsia, P; Valenti, V",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7713198/,36

With the use of probiotics like curd (dahi) and micronutrient-rich leaf protein concentrate (LPC), this immune recovery may be hastened. This study was conducted to assess the impact of supplementation of curd and LPC on nutritional status, and immunity as assessed by anthropometry, haemoglobin, ferritin levels, T- cell subpopulation and C-reactive protein (CRP), in children suffering from PEM. METHODS Eighty moderate to severely malnourished children (1-5 yr) were randomized to receive either curd or LPC in addition to WHO recommended two-step diet over 15 days. Nutritional, immunological and haematological parameters were measured before and after supplementation and compared within the groups. RESULTS The change in weight, haemoglobin level and CD4:CD8 T-cell subpopulation was significant in both the groups after supplementation. Response of CRP was blunted in PEM. Serum ferritin decreased significantly after supplementation in both groups. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION Curd and LPC when added to diet of malnourished children, may have therapeutic value by accelerating immune recovery.

191963,Talk to Patients About: ACIP.,2020-10-01,"COVID-19 has become one of the biggest health concern, along with huge economic burden. With no clear remedies to treat the disease, doctors are repurposing drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. In parallel, research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans. Since animal models are critical for vaccine development and SARS-CoV-2 has different transmission dynamics, in this review we compare different animal models of SARS-CoV-2 with humans for their pathogenic, immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for COVID-19. Another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research; thus, we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies.","Deb, Bijayeeta; Shah, Hemal; Goel, Suchi",Journal of biosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554907/,36

To investigate the molecular evolution of influenza B viruses, sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA1 subunit) and neuraminidase genes was performed. All influenza B viruses isolated between 1998 and 2000 belonged to the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage. The B/Victoria/2/87 lineage, which was cocirculating with the Yamagata lineage, was identified in Taiwan in March 2001. Concurrently, there was an increasing prevalence of this lineage in many parts of the world, including North America and Europe, during the 2001-2002 season. Since 2002, genetic reassortants of influenza B virus with the Victoria lineage of hemagglutinin and the Yamagata lineage of neuraminidase have been found at a rate of 46%. Therefore, in 2002, at least three sublineages of influenza B virus strains, the B/Shanghai/361/2002-like strain (Yamagata lineage), the B/Hong Kong/330/01-like strain (Victoria lineage), and the B/Hong Kong/1351/02-like strain (B reassortant lineage), were identified in Taiwan. The results showed that genetically distinct lineages can cocirculate in the population and that the reassortment among these strains plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses. Interestingly, from January to April 2005, B reassortant viruses became dominant (73%) in Taiwan, which indicated that a mismatch had occurred between the influenza B vaccine strain recommended for the 2004-2005 season in the Northern hemisphere by the World Health Organization and the epidemic strain.","Tsai, Huey-Pin; Wang, Hsuan-Chen; Kiang, David; Huang, Sheng-Wen; Kuo, Pin-Hwa; Liu, Ching-Chuan; Su, Ih-Jen; Wang, Jen-Ren",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16891481/,36

Previous studies have shown that expression of the chemokine CXCL10 by West Nile virus (WNV)-infected neurons is essential for the recruitment of CD8 T cells for the purpose of viral clearance within the CNS. In the current study we used mice deficient for the CXCL10 receptor, CXCR3, to evaluate its role in leukocyte-mediated viral clearance of WNV infection within various CNS compartments. WNV-infected CXCR3-deficient mice exhibited significantly enhanced mortality compared with wild-type controls. Immunologic and virologic analyses revealed that CXCR3 was dispensable for control of viral infection in the periphery and in most CNS compartments but, surprisingly, was required for CD8 T cell-mediated antiviral responses specifically within the cerebellum. WNV-specific, CXCR3-expressing T cells preferentially migrated into the cerebellum, and WNV-infected cerebellar granule cell neurons expressed higher levels of CXCL10 compared with similarly infected cortical neurons. These results indicate that WNV differentially induces CXCL10 within neuronal populations and suggest a novel model for nonredundancy in chemokine-mediated inflammation among CNS compartments.","Zhang, Bo; Chan, Ying Kai; Lu, Bao; Diamond, Michael S; Klein, Robyn S",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18250476/,36

This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R0, disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination programmes for seasonal infections is presented. The synthesis of seasonal infectious disease epidemiology attempted by this paper highlights the need for further empirical and theoretical work.","Grassly, Nicholas C; Fraser, Christophe",Proceedings.

DESIGN Descriptive case series. SETTING Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China RESULTS The outbreak started with a visitor from southern China on 21 February. At the hospitals where the first cases were treated the disease spread quickly among healthcare workers, and then out into the community as family members became infected. By 1 April, 685 cases had been reported with 16 deaths. Symptoms include high fever and one or more respiratory symptoms (including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing). Changes in lung tissue suggest that part of the lung damage is due to cytokines induced by the microbial agent, which has led to empirical treatment with corticosteroids, broad spectrum antiviral agent, and antibacterial cover. There is strong evidence that a novel coronavirus is the pathogen. Precautions for droplet infection should be instituted, including the wearing of masks and rigorous disinfection and hygiene procedures. On 27 March the Department of Health announced drastic measures, including vigorous contact tracing and examination, quarantine of contacts in their homes, and closure of all schools and universities. CONCLUSION The rapidity of the spread of the disease and the morbidity indicate that the agent responsible is highly infectious and virulent. Strict infection control measures for droplet and contact transmission by healthcare workers, a vigilant healthcare profession, and public education are essential for disease prevention.","Chan-Yeung, Moira; Yu, W C",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12702616/,36

PROBLEM This study was designed to investigate pre-event knowledge and attitudes of a national sample of the emergency prehospital medical care providers in relation to a potential human influenza pandemic, and to determine predictors of these attitudes. METHODS Surveys were distributed to a random, cross-sectional sample of 20% of the Australian emergency prehospital medical care workforce (n = 2,929), stratified by the nine services operating in Australia, as well as by gender and location. The surveys included: (1) demographic information; (2) knowledge of influenza; and (3) attitudes and perceptions related to working during influenza pandemic conditions. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of pandemic-related risk perceptions. RESULTS Among the 725 Australian emergency prehospital medical care personnel who responded, 89% were very anxious about working during pandemic conditions, and 85% perceived a high personal risk associated with working in such conditions. In general, respondents demonstrated poor knowledge in relation to avian influenza, influenza generally, and infection transmission methods. Less than 5% of respondents perceived that they had adequate education/training about avian influenza. Logistic regression analyses indicate that, in managing the attitudes and risk perceptions of emergency prehospital medical care staff, particular attention should be directed toward the paid, male workforce (as opposed to volunteers), and on personnel whose relationship partners do not work in the health industry. CONCLUSIONS These results highlight the potentially crucial role of education and training in pandemic preparedness. Organizations that provide emergency prehospital medical care must address this apparent lack of knowledge regarding infection transmission, and procedures for protection and decontamination. Careful management of the perceptions of emergency prehospital medical care personnel during a pandemic is likely to be critical in achieving an effective response to a widespread outbreak of infectious disease.","Watt, Kerrianne; Tippett, Vivienne C; Raven, Steven G; Jamrozik, Konrad; Coory, Michael; Archer, Frank; Kelly, Heath A",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20405455/,36

A large fraction of isolates exhibited a strong MAC, and the high MAC variability reflected the diversity of selective pressures in ecological niches. MAC depends on starvation, oxygen, and RpoS and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate regulons; thus it may be a by-product of genetic strategies for improving survival under stress. MAC could also be selected through beneficial mutations that it generates, as shown by computer modeling and the patterns of stress-inducible and constitutive mutagenesis.

198252,"Sweetening the ""Sweet Spot"" of Dementia.",2020,"Virus replication in higher vertebrates is restrained by IFNs that cause cells to transcribe genes encoding antiviral proteins, such as 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases. 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase is stimulated by dsRNA to produce 5'-phosphorylated, 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), whose function is to activate RNase L. Although RNase L is required for a complete IFN antiviral response and mutations in the RNase L gene (RNASEL or HPC1) increase prostate cancer rates, it is unknown how 2-5A affects these biological endpoints through its receptor, RNase L. Presently, we show that 2-5A activation of RNase L produces a remarkable stimulation of transcription (>/=20-fold) for genes that suppress virus replication and prostate cancer. Unexpectedly, exposure of DU145 prostate cancer cells to physiologic levels of 2-5A (0.1 muM) induced approximately twice as many RNA species as it down-regulated. Among the 2-5A-induced genes are several IFN-stimulated genes, including IFN-inducible transcript 1/P56, IFN-inducible transcript 2/P54, IL-8, and IFN-stimulated gene 15. 2-5A also potently elevated RNA for macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-activated gene-1, a TGF-beta superfamily member implicated as an apoptotic suppressor of prostate cancer. Transcriptional signaling to the macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1/nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-activated gene-1 promoter by 2-5A was deficient in HeLa cells expressing a nuclease-dead mutant of RNase L and was dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, both of which were activated in response to 2-5A treatments. Because 2-5A and RNase L participate in defenses against viral infections and prostate cancer, our findings have implications for basic cellular mechanisms that control major pathogenic processes.","Malathi, Krishnamurthy; Paranjape, Jayashree M; Bulanova, Elena; Shim, Minsub; Guenther-Johnson, Jeanna M; Faber, Pieter W; Eling, Thomas E; Williams, Bryan R G; Silverman, Robert H",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16203993/,36

Subsequently, the reactivity of the antiserum with recombinant N protein and SARS-CoV particles was assayed by ELISA. RESULTS Recombinant N protein reacted strongly and specifically with the sera from immunized mice and SARS patients. Similarly, the sera of immunized mice could also react specifically with SARS-CoV particles. CONCLUSION The recombinant N protein could be used as a good antigen to detect SARS. The DNA vaccine pSecN could also efficiently induce the production of IgG against N protein of SARS-CoV, which offered clues to the development of a potential DNA vaccine.","Xiang, Kai-jun; Zeng, Qi-yi; Ding, Yong-qiang; Zhu, Bing; Zhou, Rong",Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16256037/,36

The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of clinical application of heart markers in term newborns with perinatal asphyxia. METHODS During a 3-year period we analyzed 91 full-term newborns (55 with and 36 without perinatal asphyxia). In all the subjects within the first 24-48 h after birth, we simultaneously determined serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide, MB fraction of creatine kinase (CK-MB) and C-reactive protein. RESULTS In the group of full-term neonates with PA significantly higher levels of cardiac tropon-inI (p = 0.000), CK-MB fraction (p = 0.000), brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.003) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.017) were found, compared to the group of healthy full-term newborns. In merged group (n = 91) cardiac troponin I level correlated with the fifth minute Apgar score (r = -0.637, p = 0.000) and the serum lactate concentration in the first 12h after birth (r = 0.529, p = 0.000). Early increase in cardiac troponin I > 0.135 microg/L predicted the risk of death with the sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 85.9%, while the increase in CK-MB fraction, brain natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein did not have a predictive value with respect to a mortality outcome.

Understanding their fears and anxieties may hold lessons for handling future outbreaks, including acts of bioterrorism. METHOD We measured risk perception and impact on personal and work life of 15,025 HCWs from 9 major healthcare institutions during the SARS epidemic in Singapore using a self-administered questionnaire and Impact of Events Scale and analyzed the results with bivariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS From 10,511 valid questionnaires (70% response), we found that although the majority (76%) perceived a great personal risk of falling ill with SARS, they (69.5%) also accepted the risk as part of their job. Clinical staff (doctors and nurses), staff in daily contact with SARS patients, and staff from SARS-affected institutions expressed significantly higher levels of anxiety. More than half reported increased work stress (56%) and work load (53%). Many experienced social stigmatization (49%) and ostracism by family members (31%), but most (77%) felt appreciated by society. Most felt that the personal protective measures implemented were effective (96%) and that the institutional policies and protocols were clear (93%) and timely (90%).

Although CXCR4-tropic virus is more cytopathic for T cells, CCR5-tropic strains are transmitted more frequently in humans for reasons that are not understood. Phenotypically immature myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) are preferentially infected by CCR5-tropic virus, in contrast to mature mDCs, which are not susceptible to infection but instead internalize virus into a protected intracellular compartment and enhance the infection of T cells. Here, we define a mechanism to explain preferential transmission of CCR5-tropic viruses based on their interaction with mDCs and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Infected immature mDCs differentiated normally and were found to enhance CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic virus infection of T cells even in the continuous presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infectious synapses also formed normally in the presence of such antibodies. Infection of immature mDCs by CCR5-tropic virus can therefore establish a pool of infected cells that can efficiently transfer virus at the same time that they protect virus from antibody neutralization. This property of DCs may enhance infection, contribute to immune evasion, and could provide a selective advantage for CCR5-tropic virus transmission.","Ganesh, Lakshmanan; Leung, Kwanyee; Loré, Karin; Levin, Reuven; Panet, Amos; Schwartz, Owen; Koup, Richard A; Nabel, Gary J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479838/,36

Diabetes is extremely common in older patients with co-morbidities who are at risk of unfavorable outcomes. As with any other infection, poorly controlled pre-existing diabetes can promote secondary infections and lead to acute complications related to hyperglycemia, worsened itself by the infection. It is important to advise patients to have enough diabetic equipment and supplies at home, to make regular blood glucose self-tests, and to contact a caregiver immediately in case of glycemic imbalance or signs of infection. Antidiabetic therapy may need adjustments following usual sick day rules. Insulin therapy should be considered to treat any persistent hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized for an acute infection.","Kosinski, Christophe; Zanchi, Anne; Wojtusciszyn, Anne",Revue medicale suisse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374541/,36

204315,"Development and Regulation of Medical Countermeasures for COVID-19 (Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Treatments): Frequently Asked Questions [June 25, 2020]",2020,"Background: The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people in the world. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 30 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative log-logistic distribution. Results: A total of 101,739 infected individuals were confirmed until 30 March 2020, of which 14,620 recovered or discharged, and 11,591 deaths. Until the same date patients quarantined at home were 43,752, whereas hospitalized patients were 31,776, of which 3981 in intensive care. The active cases (i.e. the number of patients not yet recovered until that date) were 75,528. The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 234,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic of approximately 4 months. Conclusions: One month after the first outbreaks there seemed to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic. The pandemic due to novel Coronavirus must be a warning for all countries worldwide, regarding a rapid and complete dissemination of information, surveillance, health organization, and cooperation among the states.","Megna, Rosario",Glob Health Res Policy,,36

METHODS: A survey was emailed to all ESNR members and associates as well as distributed via professional social media channels. The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home. While 81% felt safe at work during the crisis, fewer than 50% had sufficient personal protection equipment for the duration of the entire crisis. Mental wellbeing is an area of concern, with 61% feeling (much) worse than usual. Many followed online courses/congresses and considered these a viable alternative for the future.

Here, we found that the transcription factor EGR3, located at chromosome 8p21.3, is a critical metastasis suppressor. Aberrant deletion of EGR3 was found in up to 59.76% (deep deletions, 16.87%; shallow deletions, 42.89%) of prostate cancer patients. In informatics analysis, EGR3 loss was associated with prostate cancer progression and low survival rates. EGR3 expression inversely correlated with the expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis-related gene sets in prostate cancer tissues. In prostate cancer cells, EGR3 blocked the EMT process and suppressed cell migration and invasion. In a mouse model for cancer metastasis, EGR3 overexpression significantly suppressed bone metastases of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, EGR3 transcriptionally activated ZFP36, GADD45B, and SOCS3 genes by directly binding to their promoter regions. The EMT-inhibitory and tumor-suppressive roles of the EGR3 downstream genes were identified through in vitro and in silico analyses. Together, our results showed that EGR3 may be a biomarker to predict clinical outcomes and that it plays an important role in the metastatic progression of prostate cancer.","Shin, Seung-Hyun; Kim, Iljin; Lee, Jae Eun; Lee, Mingyu; Park, Jong-Wan",Oncogene,,36

To tackle this situation, a number of strategies are being devised to either create an antidote, a vaccine, or agents capable of preventing its infection. To enable research on these strategies, numerous target proteins are identified where Spike (S) protein is presumed to be of immense potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for cell entry. The key region of S-protein that interacts with ACE2 is a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD), following whereby the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The proposition is to recognize molecules from the bundle of phytochemicals of medicinal plants known to possess antiviral potentials as a lead that could interact and mask RBD, rendering them unavailable to form ACE2 interactions. Such a molecule is called the 'S-protein blocker'. A total of 110 phytochemicals from Withania somnifera, Asparagus racemosus, Zinziber officinalis, Allium sativum, Curcuma longa and Adhatoda vasica were used in the study, of which Racemoside A, Ashwagandhanolide, Withanoside VI, Withanoside IV and Racemoside C were identified as top five hits using molecular docking. Further, essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles of these compounds were studied following to which the best three hits were analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Binding free energy calculations were performed using MM/GBSA, proving these phytochemicals can serve as S-protein blocker.","Patel, Chirag N; Goswami, Dweipayan; Jaiswal, Dharmesh G; Parmar, Robin M; Solanki, Hitesh A; Pandya, Himanshu A",J Mol Graph Model,,36

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document GPs' experiences with the large-scale uptake of VCs in the natural experiment context of the pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs' perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients' main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored using descriptive statistics, diagrams, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 1237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Among these, 1000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (1000/1237; 81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic. Overall, 51% (1766/3476) of the evaluated VCs were considered to have similar or even better suitability to assess the main reason for contact, compared to face-to-face consultations. In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% (1011/1785) of cases, as opposed to 32% (87/274) when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61% (1165/1919), compared to 35% (544/1556) for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, and administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, nonpandemic setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear future role for VCs in nonpandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs' perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","Johnsen, Tor Magne; Norberg, Børge Lønnebakke; Kristiansen, Eli; Zanaboni, Paolo; Austad, Bjarne; Krogh, Frode Helgetun; Getz, Linn",J Med Internet Res,,36

206071,COVID-19 threatens HIV care continuity in Brazil,2020,"Background: The widely variable clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV2 disease (COVID-19) range from asymptomatic infections to multiple organ failure and death. Among the organs affected is the heart. This does not only affect people who already have previous cardiovascular problems, but also healthy people. This is a reason not to overlook any symptoms or to perform targeted examinations, even if apparently unrelated to the heart, for quick recognition and timely therapy. Aim of the study: This review recapitulates the current state of knowledge on the potential mechanisms and manifestation of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A web-based search of published data was performed for all relevant studies on patients diagnosed with a COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis, and a total of 50 reports were included. The analysis of the studies evaluated highlights a male predominance, with the average age of patients being 55 years. The most common presenting symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Among ECG changes, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave amplitude alterations and ventricular tachycardia episodes were reported. Finally, we wanted to use a general evaluation without distinguishing between various countries, taking into consideration only the peer or reviewer, regardless of the declared value of the journals that have been published. Results and critical findings: The most common presenting symptoms included fever, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Among ECG changes, non-specific ST-segment and T-wave amplitude alterations and ventricular tachycardia episodes were reported. In most patients, elevated levels of cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers were measured. Left ventricular dysfunction and hypokinesis were commonly exhibited symptoms. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis with features of cardiac edema and cardiac injury. Nine patients underwent histopathological examination. Treatment with corticosteroids and immunoglobulins was the most applied strategy following the administration of antivirals. Discussion: Despite the exponentially growing knowledge on the management of COVID-19 infection, current available data on SARS-CoV2-correlated myocarditis are still limited, and several difficulties may be encountered in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: While diagnostic criteria and evaluation strategies for myocarditis are well described, no guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients have yet been established. Therefore, further research is needed to advance the understanding of this disease process and define the most appropriate strategic approach in these patients.","Carretta, Domenico Maria Silva Aline Maria D’Agostino Donato Topi Skender Lovero Roberto Charitos Ioannis Alexandros Wegierska Angelika Elzbieta Montagnani Monica Santacroce Luigi",Infectious Disease Reports,,36

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 placed nurses at the forefront of battling this pandemic in the intensive care unit (ICU). Emerging international evidence suggests nurses experience psychological and physical symptoms as a result of caring for these patients. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Using purposive sampling, 11 nurses from one ICU participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded and coded; data were analyzed using content analysis. An audit trail was maintained and member checking was employed. RESULTS: The experiences among critical care nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorized into five themes and subthemes. Emotions experienced was subcategorized into anxiety/stress, fear, helplessness, worry, and empathy. Physical symptoms was subcategorized into sleep disturbances, headaches, discomfort, exhaustion, and breathlessness. Care environment challenges was subcategorized into nurse as surrogate, inability to provide human comforting connection, patients dying, personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation, care delay, changing practice guidelines, and language barrier. Social effects was subcategorized into stigma, divergent healthcare hero perception, additional responsibilities, strained interactions with others, and isolation/loneliness. Short term coping strategies was subcategorized into co-worker support, family support, distractions, mind/body wellness, and spiritualty/faith. CONCLUSION: ICU nurses are experiencing intense psychological and physical effects as a result of caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a challenging care environment.

207508,COVID-19 Vaccines: Special Considerations for the Obese Population,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed more slowly in Africa than the rest of the world, by December, 2020, the second wave appeared to be much more aggressive with many more cases. To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place. FINDINGS: As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 3·4% of the 82 312 150 cases and 3·6% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82·6% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2·2%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

208776,A Retrospective Analysis of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Breakthrough Infections - Risk Factors and Vaccine Effectiveness,2021,"BackgroundAlthough associations between key weather indicators (i.e. temperature and humidity) and COVID-19 mortality has been reported, the relationship between these exposures among different timing in early infection stages (from virus exposure up to a few days after symptom onset) and the probability of death after infection (also called case fatality rate, CFR) has yet to be determined. MethodsWe estimated the instantaneous CFR of eight European countries using Bayesian inference in conjunction with stochastic transmission models, taking account of delays in reporting the number of newly confirmed cases and deaths. The exposure-lag-response associations between fatality rate and weather conditions to which patients were exposed at different timing were obtained using distributed lag nonlinear models coupled with mixed-effect models. ResultsOur results showed that the Odds Ratio (OR) of death is negatively associated with the temperature, with two maxima (OR=1.29 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.35) at -0.1{degrees}C; OR=1.12 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.16) at 0.1{degrees}C) occurred at the time of virus exposure and after symptom onset. Two minima (OR=0.81 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.92) at 23.2{degrees}C; OR=0.71 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.80) at 21.7{degrees}C) also occurred at these two distinct periods correspondingly. Low humidity (below 50%) during the early stages and high humidity (around 89%) after symptom onset were related to the lower fatality. ConclusionEnvironmental conditions may affect not only the initial viral load when exposure to viruses but also individuals immunity response around symptom onset.

Greater perceived freedom threat was linked to greater reactance, which in turn was associated with lower levels of adherence to hygiene- and social-related COVID-19 preventive behavior. Notably, the negative association between reactance and social-related adherence was stronger than that between reactance and hygiene-related adherence. Implications for the role of reactance in risk and crisis communication as well as for public health messaging during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Ball, Hannah; Wozniak, Tayah Renea",Health Commun,,36
209127,Comparative in silico design and validation of GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test,2021,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sudden transition to remote learning. These circumstances presented many challenges for higher education faculty and students around the world but especially for nursing education programs which are traditionally conducted in a face-to-face learning environment that includes hands-on experiential learning. METHODS: Guided by Meleis' Transition Theory, a qualitative descriptive design was utilized to explore prelicensure nursing students' experiences of the transition to remote learning during the Spring 2020 semester. Participants were recruited from one baccalaureate program in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Interviews were conducted and transcribed using a web conferencing platform. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological reduction. RESULTS: Eleven students participated. Interviews revealed four overarching themes: technological challenges, academic relationship changes, role stress and strain, and resilience. CONCLUSION: The sudden transition to remote learning resulted in a number of challenges for nursing students. Despite these challenges, students demonstrated a remarkable sense of resilience and perseverance. Faculty have an opportunity to address student stressors and design remote courses in such a way to facilitate student engagement and community building.","Wallace, Sharon; Schuler, Monika S; Kaulback, Michelle; Hunt, Karen; Baker, Manisa",Nurs. forum,,36

Furthermore, data are conflicting regarding whether COVID-19 severity correlates with degree of olfactory dysfunction. This prospective case-control study analyzed prevalence and severity of subjective loss of smell in outpatients (n = 23) and inpatients (n = 20) with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection vs healthy controls (n = 25). Olfactory dysfunction was reported more commonly in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (P < .001), and outpatients paradoxically reported loss of smell more commonly than inpatients (P = .02). Headaches were present in 52% of patients with olfactory dysfunction. Anosmia or hyposmia persisted beyond 5 days but most of the patients recovered by 30 days, suggesting favorable prognosis for olfaction. Differences between inpatients and outpatients are potentially reflective of timeline of olfactory symptoms and contextual factors, underscoring the importance of corroborative objective testing, coupled with careful tracking of temporal relationships.","D039,; Ascanio, Luca; Pandolfini, Manlio; Cingolani, Cristina; Latini, Gino; Gradoni, Paolo; Capalbo, Maria; Frausini, Gabriele; Maranzano, Massimo; Brenner, Michael J; Di Stadio, Arianna",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,36
210320,White paper on Ivermectin as a potential therapy for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and host immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection has limited the development of effective treatments. Thus, we longitudinally investigated the dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and parallel changes in cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients with different disease severities to further address disease pathogenesis. METHODS: A total of 67 patients (10 moderate, 38 severe and 19 critical cases) with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Wuhan from February 8th to April 6th, 2020 were retrospectively studied. Dynamic data of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were collected. RESULTS: On admission, compared with moderate cases, severe and critical cases showed significantly decreased levels of total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells. IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critical group. During the following hospitalization period, most of the lymphocyte subsets in the critical group began to recover to levels comparable to those in the severe group from the fourth week after illness onset, except for NK cells, which recovered after the sixth week. A sustained decrease in the lymphocyte subsets and an increase in IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in the nonsurvivors until death. There was a strong negative correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 and total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained decrease in lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4+ T cells and NK cells, interacting with proinflammatory cytokine storms was associated with severe disease and poor prognosis in COVID-19.","Liu, Yangli; Tan, Weiping; Chen, Haihong; Zhu, Ying; Wan, Li; Jiang, Ke; Guo, Yubiao; Tang, Kejing; Xie, Canmao; Yi, Hui; Kuang, Yukun; Luo, Yifeng",BMC Infect Dis,,36

214330,AACE Member Engagement Lounges During COVID-19,2021,"Purpose: Zirconia is one of the most promising implant materials due to its favorable physical, mechanical and biological properties. However, until now, we know little about the mechanism of osseointegration on zirconia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Syndecan (Sdc) on osteoblastic cell (MC3T3-E1) adhesion and proliferation onto zirconia materials. Materials and Methods: The mirror-polished disks 15 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thick of commercial pure titanium (CpTi), 3mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (3Y-TZP) and nano-zirconia (NanoZr) are used in this study. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto specimen surfaces and subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) for Syndecan-1, Syndecan-2, Syndecan-3, and Syndecan-4. At 48h post-transfection, the cell morphology, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion were observed using scanning electron microscopy or laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. At 24h and 48h post-transfection, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate cell proliferation. Results: The cell morphology of MC3T3-E1 cells on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr changed into abnormal shape after gene silencing of Syndecan. Among the Syndecan family, Sdc-2 is responsible for NanoZr-specific morphology regulation, via maintenance of cytoskeletal conformation without affecting cellular attachment. According to CCK-8 assay, Sdc-2 affects the osteoblastic cell proliferation onto NanoZr. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, we suggest that Syndecan affects osteoblastic cell adhesion on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr. Sdc-2 might be an important heparin-sensitive cell membrane regulator in osteoblastic cell adhesion, specifically on NanoZr, through the organization of actin cytoskeleton and affects osteoblastic cell proliferation.","Sun, Lu; Hong, Guang; Matsui, Hiroyuki; Song, Yun-Jia; Sasaki, Keiichi",Int J Nanomedicine,,36

The goal of this paper is to report the outcomes of 11 patients who underwent humeral fracture surgery in the first few weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of 11 patients who underwent humeral fracture surgery during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, between March 10 and April 25, 2020. The clinical outcomes of these operative patients were monitored up to May 12, 2020, the final date of follow-up, a minimum of 15 days after all patients were discharged from the hospital. COVID-19 infection, mortality, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-six humeral fractures were recorded between March 10 and April 25, 2020. During this period, humeral fracture fixation was the third most common surgery for fracture in our institution after hip fracture and ankle fracture surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgery (30.5%), of whom 7 were women (63.3%). The mean age was 64.8 years (standard deviation, 13.5). Nine operated cases had a proximal humerus fracture and 2 had a humeral shaft fracture. One of the 11 patients was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of throat swab samples. The overall median surgical time was 101.2 minutes (standard deviation, 28.4). The overall median hospital length stay for the patient discharged was 2.2 days (range, 1-4 days). No COVID-19 nosocomial intrahospital infection occurred, and no patient reported COVID-19 infection during the 15 days after hospital discharge. No intrahospital mortality was recorded. Furthermore, no COVID-19 infection was reported in the shoulder surgeons who performed the surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Although humeral fractures were not the most frequent fractures during this outbreak, some required surgery. With good preoperative management that included reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 and chest radiographs, protective measurements for the surgical team, and rapid discharge of the patients, we were able to operate on 11 humeral fractures with no COVID-19 nosocomial intrahospital infection in the patients or in the shoulder surgeons who performed the surgeries.","Garcia-Portabella, Montserrat; Nuñez, Jorge H; Batalla, Lledó; Plomer, Martin; Lakhani, Kushal; Massons, Josep",J Shoulder Elbow Surg,,36

It is important to not only recognize, but to embrace them as drivers of the public to the current pandemic success. In this commentary, we discuss the opportunities and challenges that may affect ongoing public health programming in Australia within the current context of epidemiology. COVID-19 within Australia has to date been effectively suppressed through the implementation of nationally coordinated, in which the state delivered public policy, guidelines and practice, and successful establishment of a comprehensive testing, contact tracing, patient isolation and contact quarantine regime combined with national and state social distancing, hygiene etiquette and movement restrictions. However, despite its success to date great challenges lay ahead for future public health policy with the threat of a second wave, or more likely, multiple smaller outbreaks across various population centres. Therefore, policies that aim to balance the twin socioeconomic and health impacts are crucial. The experience of Australia in managing its COVID-19 response can provide a case study for other countries to reshape or adapt their policies and actions in the context of emerging global health crises.","Van Nguyen, Huy Lan Nguyen Hoa Thi Minh Dao An Van Nguyen Tien The Nguyen Phuong Mai Le Phuong Duy Vu Kien Thi Ngoc Tran Anh Kim Dao Phuong Thi Nguyen Cham Debattista Joseph",The International Journal of Health Planning and Management,,36

218393,A Real-time Robot-based Auxiliary System for Risk Evaluation of COVID-19 Infection,2020-08-18,"CONTEXT: Reductions in population mobility can mitigate virus transmission and, in turn, disease-related mortality. But do social distancing policies in response to COVID-19 actually change population behavior and, if so, what political, socioeconomic, and epidemiological factors condition this policy effect? METHODS: We leverage subnational variation in the stringency and timing of state-issued social distancing policies to test their effects on population mobility from March to December 2020 across 109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. We also explore how conventional explanations of compliance, including political trust, socioeconomic resources, health risks, and partisanship, modify these policy effects. FINDINGS: In Brazil and the U.S., mandatory stay-at-home orders and workplace closures jointly reduced mobility, especially early in the pandemic. In Mexico, where federal government intervention created greater policy uniformity across states, workplace closures produced the most consistent reduction in mobility. Conventional explanations of compliance perform well in the U.S. but not in Brazil and Mexico, with the exception of socioeconomic resources. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to new directions for future research on the politics of compliance, the article offers insights for policymakers about which public health measures are likely to elicit compliance. Our finding that the efficacy of workplace closures at reducing population mobility increases with levels of socioeconomic development suggests that cash transfers, economic stimulus packages, and other policies that mitigate the financial burdens of the pandemic may help reduce population mobility by decreasing the costs of staying at home.","Testa, Paul F; Snyder, Richard; Rios, Eva; Moncada, Eduardo; Giraudy, Agustina; Bennouna, Cyril",J. health polit. policy law,,36

221971,Maternal endothelial dysfunction in HIV-associated preeclampsia comorbid with COVID-19: a review,2021,"In December 2019, cases of pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, China, which were caused by the highly contagious coronavirus. This study is aimed at comparing the confusion regarding the selection of effective diagnostic methods to make a mutual comparison among existing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and at determining the most effective one. Based on available published evidence and clinical practice, diagnostic tests of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were evaluated by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, namely, fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (fuzzy PROMETHEE) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS). Computerized tomography of chest (chest CT), the detection of viral nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction, cell culture, CoV-19 antigen detection, CoV-19 antibody IgM, CoV-19 antibody IgG, and chest X-ray were evaluated by linguistic fuzzy scale to compare among the diagnostic tests. This scale consists of selected parameters that possessed different weights which were determined by the experts' opinions of the field. The results of our study with both proposed MCDM methods indicated that the most effective diagnosis method of COVID-19 was chest CT. It is interesting to note that the methods that are consistently used in the diagnosis of viral diseases were ranked in second place for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, each country should use appropriate diagnostic solutions according to its own resources. Our findings also show which diagnostic systems can be used in combination.","Sayan, Murat; Sarigul Yildirim, Figen; Sanlidag, Tamer; Uzun, Berna; Uzun Ozsahin, Dilber; Ozsahin, Ilker",Comput Math Methods Med,,36

There is scarce literature regarding the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes for these patients with coexisting viral infections (seropositive HNSCC). We conducted this study to assess the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes (overall survival [OS] and disease-specific survival [DSS]) of seropositive HNSCC patients. Methodology: This was a retrospective cohort study on seropositive HNSCC patients registered at our center from 2012 to 2014. The viral infections were identified by the presence of the antibodies to these viruses in the patient's blood samples. Results: Out of the 19,137 HNSCC patients registered, 156 patients had HBV, HCV, and/or HIV infection. Among these, HBV infection was the most common (n = 86/156, 55.1%) followed by HIV infection (n = 36/156, 23.1%) and HCV infection (n = 29/156, 18.6%). The oral cavity was the most common subsite involved. Majority of these patients presented at an advanced stage (advanced T stage - 71.8% and node positive - 62.2%). The majority of the patients received curative-intent treatment (65.4%). The OS at 3 years for these HNSCC patients with coexisting HIV, HBV, and HCV infection was 60%, 62.6%, and 57.5%, respectively, and their DSS at 3 years was 58.8%, 78.6%, and 53.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Seropositive patients with HNSCC often present in the advanced stage but have a good survival if treated appropriately.","Nayyar, Supreet Singh; Thiagarajan, Shivakumar; Malik, Akshat; D039,; Cruz, Anil; Chaukar, Devendra; Patil, Prachi; Alahari, Aruna Dhir; Lashkar, Sarbani Ghosh; Prabhash, Kumar",J Cancer Res Ther,,36

Background: While at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the need for intensive care is increasing, the specific care needs of patients are still largely unknown. This is a challenge for the work of intensive care staff. AIM: The aim of the study is to understand how intensive care nurses perceive their working conditions and the consequences for patient care. METHODS: The study is a qualitative survey. Using a web-based questionnaire, narratives of n = 902 nurses were collected. This article reports the perceptions of n = 397 intensive care nurses. The evaluation is based on the qualitative content analysis according to 18-2Mayring (2015). RESULTS: The analysis of the data shows the following six categories: ""The lack of staff is extremely noticeable"" to ""Waiting for something"", ""struggle for PPE (personal protective equipment)"", ""time to learn"", ""considerable discrepancy"" in patient care, ""attempts to compensate"" and ""constantly a bad feeling"". The tension between the lack of knowledge and information on the one hand and the professional demand to do justice to the seriously ill and their relatives on the other hand, brings nurses to their professional limits. CONCLUSION: Conditions for ethical decision making have to be developed and concepts for a clear attribution of autonomy and responsibility for intensive care nurses must be introduced.","Begerow, Anke; Michaelis, Ulrike; Gaidys, Uta",Pflege,,36

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese civil servants have faced high workloads that may contribute to mental disorders. We assessed the prevalence of both depression and anxiety symptoms among civil servants in Jiangsu and surrounding provinces using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Methods: The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: In total, 867 Chinese civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control were included in our study. Overall, 37.25 and 38.06% of all respondents reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Respondents who were younger and more educated and those who had fewer years of work experience had higher scores for both depression and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being younger, having more education and having fewer years of work experience were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, whether they had experience combating infectious diseases or worked in frontline, there was no significant difference between respondents with and without experience, as well as between frontline and non-frontline workers, in both symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: The civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control reported suffering from varying degrees of mental disorders. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to the psychological distress of these civil servants.","Hu, Qingqing; Hu, Xiaochu; Zheng, Beibei; Li, Lanjuan",Front Public Health,,36

In absence of specific therapeutic recommendations, it is essential to make a correct assessment of the risk of haemorrhage/thrombosis. Based on expert opinion, strategies for outpatient management include adherence to prescribed regimens, telemedicine, and communication about COVID-19 in patients with CBD. More data should be also collected to better characterize the impact of COVID-19 on patients with CBD. The current findings encourage further studies to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection in CBD patients to understand more fully the burden of this novel pathogen and to develop adequate preventive measures against this infection.","Naderi, Majid; Malek, Fatemeh; Miri Aliabad, Ghasem; Behnampoor, Mahammad; Karimi, Mehran; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,,36
226538,Brain Connectivity: Advancing the Field of Neuroscience in the Era of COVID-19,2021,"Infectious diseases are a significant threat to human society which was over sighted before the incidence of COVID-19, although according to the report of the World Health Organisation (WHO) about 4.2 million people die annually due to infectious disease. Due to recent COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2 million people died during 2020 and 96.2 million people got affected by this devastating disease. Recent research shows that applying individual interactions and movements data could help managing the pandemic though modelling the spread of infectious diseases on social contact networks. Infectious disease spreading can be explained with the theories and methods of diffusion processes where a dynamic phenomena evolves on networked systems. In the modelling of diffusion process, it is assumed that contagious items spread out in the networked system through the inter-node interactions. This resembles spreading of infectious virus, e.g. spread of COVID-19, within a population through individual social interactions. The evolution behaviours of the diffusion process are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the underlying system and the mechanism of the diffusion process itself. Thus, spreading of infectious disease can be explained how people interact with each other and by the characteristics of the disease itself. This paper presenters the relevant theories and methodologies of diffusion process that can be used to model the spread of infectious diseases.","Shahzamal, Md; Khan, Saeed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02768v1.pdf,36

227364,A neurologist in the COVID unit: Reflections on a redeployment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although the rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a considerable threat to global public health, no specific treatment is available for COVID-19. ReDuNing injection (RDN) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to exert antibacterial, antiviral, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, RDN has been recommended in the diagnosis and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pneumonia by the National Health Council and the National Administration of Chinese Medicine. However, there is no information regarding its efficacy against COVID-19. AIM OF STUDY: This study was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of RDN in patients with COVID-19 and characterize its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 adults with COVID-19 were included in this study, and the primary endpoint was recovery from clinical symptoms following 14 days of treatment. General improvements were defined as the disappearance of the major symptoms of infection including fever, fatigue, and cough. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved clinical symptom amelioration on days 7 and 10, time to clinical recovery, time to a negative nucleic acid test result, duration of hospitalization, and time to defervescence. Plaque reduction and cytopathic effect assays were also performed in vitro, and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-6, IFN-&#945;, IFN-Î³, IL-2 and CCL-5) during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The RDN group exhibited a shorter median time for the resolution of clinical symptoms (120 vs. 220 h, P < 0.0001), less time to a negative PCR test result (215 vs. 310 h, P = 0.0017), shorter hospitalization (14.8 vs. 18.5 days, P = 0.0002), and lower timeframe for defervescence (24.5 vs. 75 h, P = 0.0001) than the control group. In addition, time to improved imaging was also shorter in the RDN group than in the control group (6 vs.8.9 days, P = 0.0273); symptom resolution rates were higher in the RDN group than in the control group at 7 (96.30% vs. 39.13%, P < 0.0001) and 10 days (96.30% vs. 56.52%, P = 0.0008). No allergic reactions or anaphylactic responses were reported in this trial. RDN markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and viral plaque formation in vitro. In addition, RDN significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine production in infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: RDN relieves clinical symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection by regulating inflammatory cytokine-related disorders, suggestion that this medication might be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.","Ma, Qinhai; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Lei, Biao; Chen, Ruihan; Liu, Bin; Jiang, Haiming; Wang, Yutao; Liu, Qingquan; Yang, Zifeng",J Ethnopharmacol,,36

The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei",Biosci Trends,,36

230000,Covid-19 modelling: The effects of social distancing,2020,"The National Blood Transfusion Services under the aegis of the ministry of health and family welfare, India has recently issued guidelines regarding the blood donor selection criteria and the processing of blood. Care has been taken to make the blood transfusions safer. However, COVID-19 has disrupted the organization of the voluntary blood donation drives, whole blood donations [WBD] and restricted the donors' movement to the blood transfusion centres all across the world. While sickness and the need for transfusions are very much in place, the gap of demand against blood collection has widened. Additionally, with the monsoon season at hand, and the categorical challenges of a dengue outbreak, the subsequent need for blood components especially the platelet concentrates is going to rise. Some of the criteria laid for deferring a blood donor from his or her WBD need a categorical revision, considering these unprecedented times. We, therefore, critically analyzed the blood donor selection criteria and hereby, suggest an updating regarding the pre-donation haemoglobin, sexually transmitted diseases, lactation, pregnancy and many such subheadings. We also suggest collecting smaller blood volumes in the blood bags for the optimal benefit of the recipients both for now and also as a measure of pandemic preparedness for future use.","Das, K; Raturi, M; Agrawal, N; Kala, M; Kusum, A",Transfus. clin. biol,,36
230012,Covid-19: What do we know so far about a vaccine?,2020,"Emission benefits of transit buses depend on ridership. Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers' trips are used for acquiring private cars' emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00-8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00-18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be ""greener"" travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","Sui, Yi; Zhang, Haoran; Shang, Wenlong; Sun, Rencheng; Wang, Changying; Ji, Jun; Song, Xuan; Shao, Fengjing",Appl Energy,,36

The surgical protocol was splenectomy, autoimplantation of spleen tissue into a pouch of the major omentum and ligature of the left gastric vein. Follow up of these patients ranges from one to ten years with a mean of five years. The BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L2 - L4) through the dual energy absorptionmetry X-ray (DEXA), using a LUNAR DPX-L densitometer. The degree of Symmers´ fibrosis was assessed by semiautomatic hystomorphometry. In eleven patients, the serum magnesium was measured before an intravenous overload of this ion and subsequently after eight and twenty four hours. Urine was collected 24 hours before and 24 hours after the magnesium overload. Deficiency of magnesium was considered when the uptake of this ion was greater than 40%. There was a significant trend of association between the status of bone mineral content and the Symmers´ fibrosis degree (c² = 6.606 R = 0.01017). There was also a moderate agreement between the greater fibrosis densities ( > the mean percentage) and bone mineral deficits. Although the normal bone mineral content was more found among the patients with better hepatic functional reserve, the results did not reach statistical significance. There was a marked magnesium retention (>95%) in one patient who had severe osteoporosis and a slight depletion ( 5%) in another patient, who presented no bone mineral deficit. It was concluded that the patients included in this series, showed an important BMD deficit, specially among the females which has had a significant improvement after medical and surgical treatment. Bone mineral deficit was associated with the degree of Symmers´ fibrosis. Magnesium depletion was present in two out of eleven patients. It is speculated that magnesium supplementation may be warranted to forestall the progression of bone mineral deficit in patients with more impaired hepatic functional reserve.","Teixeira Brandt, Carlos; Marcelo Gonçalves de Souza, Antônio; Virgínia da Motta Braga, Maria; Leal Reis de Melo, Karina; de Oliveira Andrade Marques, Karina; Dantas Sena, Andréa; Almeida, Fernando",Acta cir. bras.,,36

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feasibility and patient safety of a hybrid monitoring strategy of point of care (POC) BG plus continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in the ICU. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: ICU of an academic medical center. PATIENTS: Patients with COVID-19 on intravenous (IV) insulin. INTERVENTION: After meeting initial validation criteria, CGM was used for IV insulin titration and POC BG was performed every 6 hours or as needed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included frequency of POC BG, workflow, safety, and accuracy measures. RESULTS: The study included 19 patients, 18 with CGM data, mean age 58 years, 89% on mechanical ventilation, 37% on vasopressors, and 42% on dialysis. The median time to CGM validation was 137 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 114-206). During IV insulin, the median number of POC values was 7 (IQR 6-16) on day 1, and declined slightly thereafter ( 71% reduction compared to standard of 24 /day). The median number of CGM values used nonadjunctively to titrate IV insulin was 11.5 (IQR 0, 15) on day 1 and increased thereafter. Time in range 70-180mg/dl was 64+/-23% on day 1 and 72+/-16% on day 2-7 while time <70 mg/dl was 1.5 +/-4.1% on day 1 and <1% on days 2-7. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data to support that CGM using a hybrid protocol is feasible, accurate, safe, and has potential to reduce nursing and staff workload.","Faulds, Eileen R; Boutsicaris, Andrew; Sumner, Lyndsey; Jones, Laureen; McNett, Molly; Smetana, Keaton S; May, Casey C; Buschur, Elizabeth; Exline, Mathew C; Ringel, Mathew D; Dungan, Kathleen",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,36

However, social-epidemiological patterns of the pandemic which go beyond differences by age and gender have hardly been addressed in Germany. First reports from other western industrialised countries indicate that people living in socioeconomically deprived areas and people of color have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 progression and mortality. Social inequalities in the risk of infection due to different living and working conditions, and social inequalities in the susceptibility and risk factors for severe COVID-19, particularly in pre-existing medical conditions, might play an important role in explaining those findings. Such inequalities are well established for Germany, as well. It can therefore be assumed that also in Germany people with a lower socioeconomic status might be more affected during the further course of the pandemic. In addition, the interventions to contain the pandemic might have unequal social, economic and psychological impacts on different social groups. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has the overall potential to increase social and health inequalities. Social-epidemiological research into COVID-19 is therefore needed to advance measures of health protection and infection control in an evidence-based, targeted and socially equitable manner.","Wachtler, Benjamin; Hoebel, Jens",Gesundheitswesen,,36

231463,NF-κB signalling as a pharmacological target in COVID-19: potential roles for IKKß inhibitors,2021,"BACKGROUND: Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) has been shown to offer a promising alternative for the inactivation of bacteria on egg surfaces, but the cuticle of the egg is damaged during this disinfection process. However, if SAEW disinfection is followed by chitosan (CS) coating treatment, this will construct a new membrane and prevent the loss of moisture and carbon dioxide through the damaged cuticle. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of SAEW disinfection followed by CS coating treatment for improving the internal quality of eggs during 6 weeks of storage at 25 °C. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy revealed that SAEW-treated eggs had deeper and wider cracks than control eggs stored between 0 and 21 days. Moreover, the depth and width of the cracks in the uncoated eggs increased as storage time increased. However, the CS coating method was successfully used on SAEW-disinfected eggs to construct a barrier against the negative effects of shell damage. After 6 weeks of storage at 25 °C, the yolk index, albumen pH, Haugh unit value and weight loss value of the SAEW + CS group were 0.31%, 9.01%, 63.72% and 5.35%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of SAEW and CS was more effective at maintaining internal egg quality than SAEW or CS treatments alone during storage. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","Sheng, Xiaowei; Shu, Dengqun; Li, Yanjiao; Zhan, Zhewen; Yuan, Xingyun; Liu, Sanfeng; Wu, Hongxiang; Bing, San; Zang, Yitian",J. sci. food agric,,36

If a public health emergency like the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbates the SWM problem, its true importance as an imperative service becomes more apparent. The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of waste generation globally in nearly every sector and has therefore raised the need for special attention. The unpredictable variations in the quantity and composition of waste also pressurize policymakers to react dynamically. This review highlights the major problems faced during the pandemic by SWM sector and the underlying possibilities to fill the gaps in the existing system. The review focuses on particular areas that have been the most important cause of concern throughout the crisis in the process of waste management. In addition, the mixing of virus infected biomedical waste with the stream of normal solid waste and lack of active involvement of the citizen and cooperation presents major negative safety and health concerns for the workers involved in the sanitation process. Apart from presenting innovative solutions to tackle current waste management issues, this study also proposes several key potential guidelines to holistically mitigate possible future pandemics, if any. This article can also be of great implication for creation of a specific strategy towards preventing/controlling any potential pandemic of similar kind in the near future.

In the following article, an attempt has been made to identify main problems regarding the biological security in large workplaces outside the healthcare sector, while simultaneously pointing out the possible solutions to these problems. In this article, a literature review was performed with regard to publications that have been published within the last 4 months, concerning the issue of risk factors with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations. Experts' opinions and statements released by institutions working in this field were also taken into consideration. On the basis of the available publications, key procedures to protect workers in large workplaces against COVID-19 were established. One of these key factors is infection prevention. It is commonly known that, due to limited possibilities of identifying infected people that are asymptomatic, physical distance in the whole employee population should be kept; personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used and tele-work should be implemented. The results of recent research have shown that, apart from airborne ways of transmission, there also exists a possibility of getting infected by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. Therefore, frequent disinfection of rooms and work tools is essential. In the current situation, due to the lack of a vaccine, only going through the COVID-19 disease, either in a symptomatic or asymptomatic form, significantly increases the chances of developing natural immunity. The means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections include quickly identifying the infected people on the basis of the symptoms they report, keeping physical distance, using PPE, disinfecting rooms and applying proper ventilation. Limiting the number of workers by implementing a remote work pattern is also recommended. Med Pr. 2021;72(1):89-97.","Hanke, Wojciech; Pietrzak, Patrycja",Med Pr,,36

While IPV victims may attend emergency departments (EDs) seeking medical care, not all of them will make an allegation against their abusers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and the characteristics of the victims, who had made an allegation about the violent incident and had been examined by a forensic pathologist for judicial purposes, and had attended EDs seeking medical care, before the forensic examination. METHODS: We reviewed the archives of clinical examinations that were conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens during a 5-year period (2012-16). RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-four clinical examinations were conducted at our Department for IPV allegations. According to our findings, women were more likely to seek medical care than men. Victims who have attended EDs were more likely to have sustained injuries located at least on the head or on the lower limbs. CONCLUSION: The majority of IPV victims in the broader region of Attica (Greece) were women, usually married, and aged between 30 and 49 years old. Despite the fact that the majority of IPV incidents are not reported to police, every person who is engaged in the process of dealing with IPV victims has to be educated and adequately informed about this phenomenon, its implications and the possible ways to deal with it. Furthermore, victims need to be educated and informed adequately in waiting rooms of EDs.","Katsos, Konstantinos; Sakelliadis, Emmanouil I; Zorba, Eleni; Tsitsika, Artemis; Papadodima, Stavroula; Spiliopoulou, Chara",,,36

The purpose of this study was to explore its active compounds and demonstrate its mechanisms against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: All the components of HSBDF were retrieved from the pharmacology database of TCM system. The genes corresponding to the targets were retrieved using UniProt and GeneCards database. The herb-compound-target network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target protein-protein interaction network was built using STRING database. The core targets of HSBDF were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The main active compounds of HSBDF were docked with SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). RESULTS: Compound-target network mainly contained 178 compounds and 272 corresponding targets. Key targets contained MAPK3, MAPK8, TP53, CASP3, IL6, TNF, MAPK1, CCL2, PTGS2, etc. There were 522 GO items in GO enrichment analysis (p < .05) and 168 signaling pathways (p < .05) in KEGG, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that baicalein and quercetin were the top two compounds of HSBDF, which had high affinity with ACE2. CONCLUSION: Baicalein and quercetin in HSBDF may regulate multiple signaling pathways through ACE2, which might play a therapeutic role on COVID-19.","Tao, Quyuan; Du, Jiaxin; Li, Xiantao; Zeng, Jingyan; Tan, Bo; Xu, Jianhua; Lin, Wenjia; Chen, Xin-Lin",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,,36

Although many studies focus primarily on loneliness, patterns of social isolation-particularly physical and digital isolation-are understudied. We examined changes in social isolation, physical isolation, digital isolation, and loneliness in US adults over 50 before and during the lockdown. METHODS: Two waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a national panel sample of US adults over 50 years old, were used. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change from 2016 to 2020 to examine the impact of social distancing policies during the pandemic. RESULTS: There was an increase in physical isolation and social isolation among respondents during the COVID-19 social distancing policies. However, respondents experienced no change in digital isolation or loneliness. The increase in physical isolation was only present for people with high COVID-19 concern whereas people with low concern experienced no change in physical isolation. DISCUSSION: Despite an increase in physical isolation due to the social distancing policies, US adults aged over 50 stayed connected through digital contact and were resilient in protecting themselves from loneliness.","Peng, Siyun; Roth, Adam R",,,36

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: An international dermatology registry was circulated to health care providers worldwide through the American Academy of Dermatology, International League of Dermatologic Societies, and other organizations. RESULTS: We documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19. Of 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 by providers, 23 (7%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 20 others (6%) were close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Given current testing criteria, many patients lacked COVID-19 testing access. For 55% of patients, pernio-like lesions were their only symptom. In patients with other COVID-19 symptoms, pernio-like lesions typically appeared after other symptoms. Pernio-like lesions lasted a median of 14 days (interquartile range, 10-21 days).

A 64-year-woman with a one-month hospital admission for severe bilateral pneumonia associated with COVID-19 and 10 days after discharge presented with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Severe C. difficile-associated colitis is diagnosed according to clinical features and CT findings. An urgent pancolectomy was performed due to her bad response to conservative treatment. Later evolution slowly improved to recovery. C. difficile-associated colitis is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Significant patient-related risk factors for C. difficile infection are antibiotic exposure, older age, and hospitalisation. Initial therapeutic recommendations in our country included administration broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients with bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2. These antibiotics are strongly associated with C. difficile infection. Our patient developed a serious complication of C. difficile due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The appearance of late digestive symptoms in patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 should alert clinicians to the possibility of C. difficile infection. The updated criteria for severe colitis and severe C. difficile infection should be considered to ensure an early effective treatment for the complication.","Páramo-Zunzunegui, J; Ortega-Fernández, I; Calvo-Espino, P; Diego-Hernández, C; Ariza-Ibarra, I; Otazu-Canals, L; Danés-Grases, J E; Menchero-Sánchez, A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,36

BACKGROUND: For every individual in the United States who died of a firearm injury in 2017, three survived, living with the burden of their injury. Current firearm research largely focuses on mortality and short-term health outcomes, while neglecting the long-term consequences. METHODS: We contacted adult patients with a moderate-to-severe injury from a firearm or motor vehicle crash (MVC) treated at 3 level I trauma centers in Boston between 2015 and 2018. Patients were contacted 6 to 12 months postinjury to measure: presence of daily pain; screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); new functional limitations; return to work; and physical and mental health-related quality of life. We matched each firearm injury patient to MVC patients using Coarsened Exact Matching. Adjusted Generalized Linear Models were used to compare matched patients. RESULTS: Of 177 eligible firearm injury survivors, 100 were successfully contacted and 63 completed the study. Among them, 67.7% reported daily pain, 53.2% screened positive for PTSD, 38.7% reported a new functional limitation in an activity of daily living, and 59.1% have not returned to work. Compared with population norms, overall physical and mental health-related quality of life was significantly reduced among firearm injury survivors. Compared with matched MVC survivors (n = 255), firearm injury survivors were significantly more likely to have daily pain [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-4.87], to screen positive for PTSD (adjusted OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.42-6.58), and had significantly worse physical and mental health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for targeted long-term follow-up care, physical rehabilitation, mental health screening, and interventions for survivors of firearm violence.","Herrera-Escobar, Juan Pablo; de Jager, Elzerie; McCarty, Justin Conrad; Lipsitz, Stuart; Haider, Adil H; Salim, Ali; Nehra, Deepika",Ann. surg,,36

236608,International Article: Incubators and Isolation-Protecting NICU Patients during the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"The tropism of SARS-CoV-2, a virus responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, towards the host cells is determined, at least in part, by the expression and distribution of its cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells; its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2 followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second-messenger signaling cascades via activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption that controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR-mediated Cl- transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways such as ENaC-dependent Na+ uptake and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","Hameid, Reem Abdel; Cormet-Boyaka, Estelle; Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Uddin, Mohammed; Berdiev, Bakhrom K","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,36
237104,"CovMulNet19, Integrating Proteins, Diseases, Drugs, and Symptoms: A Network Medicine Approach to COVID-19",2020,"Background: Crowdsourcing was recognized as having the potential to collect information rapidly, inexpensively and accurately. U-Report is a mobile empowerment platform that connects young people all over the world to information that will change their lives and influence decisions. Previous studies of U-Report's effectiveness highlight strengths in the timeliness, low cost and high credibility for collecting and sending information, however they also highlight areas to improve on concerning data representation. EquityTool has developed a simpler approach to assess the wealth quintiles of respondents based on fewer questions derived from large household surveys such as Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Methods: The methodology of Equity Tool was adopted to assess the socio-economic profile of U-Reporters (ie, enrolled participants of U-Report) in Bangladesh. The RapidPro flow collected the survey responses and scored them against the DHS national wealth index using the EquityTool methodology. This helped placing each U-Reporter who completed all questions into the appropriate wealth quintile. Results: With 19% of the respondents completing all questions, the respondents fell into all 5 wealth quintiles, with 79% in the top-two quintiles and only 21% in the lower-three resulting in an Equity Index of 53/100 where 100 is completely in line with Bangladesh equity distribution and 1 is the least in line. An equitable random sample of 1828 U-Reporters from among the regular and frequent respondents was subsequently created for future surveys and the sample has an Equity Index of 98/100. Conclusions: U-Report in Bangladesh does reach the poorest quintiles while the initial recruitment skews to respondents towards better off families. It is possible to create an equitable random sub-sample of respondents from all five wealth quintiles and thus process information and data for future surveys. Moving forward, U-Reporters from the poorly represented quintiles may be incentivized to recruit peers to increase equity and representation. In times of COVID-19, U-Report in combination with the EquityTool has the potential to enhance the quality of crowdsourced data for statistical analysis.","Powell, James; Brooks, Christopher; Watanabe, Miku; Balaji, Lakshmi N",J Glob Health,,36

This paper applies a mixed-method approach to map the post-COVID-19 SDGs targets on a fuzzy action priority surface at the country level in Iran, as a developing country, by taking the following four main steps: (1) using a modified Delphi method to make a list of the SDGs targets influenced by COVID-19; (2) using the best-worst method, as a multi-criteria decision-making tool, to weight the COVID-19 effects on the SDGs targets achievement; also (3) to weight the impact of the SDGs targets on the sustainable development implementation; and finally (4) designing a fuzzy inference system to calculate the action priority scores of the SDGs targets. As a result, reduction of poor people proportion by half (SDG 1.2), development-oriented policies for supporting creativity and job creation (SDG 8.3), end the pandemics and other epidemics (SDG 3.3), reduction of deaths and economic loss caused by disasters (SDG 11.5), and financial support for small-scale enterprises (SDG 9.3) were identified as the highest priorities for action, respectively, in the recovery agenda for sustainable development post COVID-19. The provided fuzzy action priority surface supports the UN's SDGs achievement and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Iran. It also serves as a guideline to help the government, stakeholders, and policy-makers better analyze the long-term effects of the pandemic on the SDGs and their associated targets and mitigate its adverse economic, social, and environmental consequences.","Ranjbari, Meisam; Shams Esfandabadi, Zahra; Scagnelli, Simone Domenico; Siebers, Peer-Olaf; Quatraro, Francesco",Environ Dev Sustain,,36

The variants that attract most attention are those of public health concern, including B.1.1.7 (UK), P.1 (Brazilian) and B.1.351 (South African). This list is extended by the variants of interest that emerge and are expanding in certain countries but are found sporadically in others, such as B.1.427 and B.1.429 (Californians) or B.1.617 (Indian). Whole genome sequencing or strategies specifically targeting the spicule gene are used in the microbiology laboratories for characterization and detection. The number of infected individuals, the sanitary situation of each country, epidemiological measures and vaccination strategies influence its dispersion and new variants are expected to emerge.

To uncover these events, we performed transcriptome analyses of lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients, revealing a gene enrichment pattern similar to that of PPARÎ³-knockout macrophages. Single-cell gene expression analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids revealed a characteristic trajectory of PPARÎ³-related disturbance in the CD14+/CD16+ cells. We identified a correlation with the disease severity and the reduced expression of several members of the PPARÎ³ complex such as EP300, RXRA, RARA, SUMO1, NR3C1, CCDC88A. CHIP-seq analyses confirmed repression of the PPARÎ³-RXRA-NR3C1 cistrome in COVID-19 lung samples. Further analysis of protein-protein networks highlighted an interaction between the PPARÎ³-associated protein SUMO1 and a nucleoprotein of the SARS virus. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time, the involvement of the PPARÎ³ complex in severe COVID-19 lung disease and suggest strongly its role in the major monocyte / macrophage-mediated inflammatory storm.","Desterke, Christophe; Turhan, Ali G; Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise; Griscelli, Frank",iScience,,36

In this article, we introduce NAIRA, a Multimodal Learning Analytics platform that provides Real-Time Feedback to foster collaborative learning activities' efficiency. NAIRA provides real-time visualizations for students' verbal interactions when working in groups, allowing teachers to perform precise interventions to ensure learning activities' correct execution. We present a case study with 24 undergraduate subjects performing a remote collaborative learning activity based on the Jigsaw learning technique within the COVID-19 pandemic context. The main goals of the study are (1) to qualitatively describe how the teacher used NAIRA's visualizations to perform interventions and (2) to identify quantitative differences in the number and time between students' spoken interactions among two different stages of the activity, one of them supported by NAIRA's visualizations. The case study showed that NAIRA allowed the teacher to monitor and facilitate the learning activity's supervised stage execution, even in a remote learning context, with students working in separate virtual classrooms with their video cameras off. The quantitative comparison of spoken interactions suggests the existence of differences in the distribution between the monitored and unmonitored stages of the activity, with a more homogeneous speaking time distribution in the NAIRA supported stage.","Cornide-Reyes, Hector; Riquelme, Fabián; Monsalves, Diego; Noel, Rene; Cechinel, Cristian; Villarroel, Rodolfo; Ponce, Francisco; Munoz, Roberto",Sensors (Basel),,36

240871,To mask or not to mask children to overcome COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Canine progressive retinal atrophies are a group of hereditary retinal degenerations in dogs characterised by depletion of photoreceptor cells in the retina, which ultimately leads to blindness. PRA in the Lhasa Apso (LA) dog has not previously been clinically characterised or described in the literature, but owners in the UK are advised to have their dog examined through the British Veterinary Association/ Kennel Club/ International Sheep Dog Society (BVA/KC/ISDS) eye scheme annually, and similar schemes that are in operation in other countries. After the exclusion of 25 previously reported canine retinal mutations in LA PRA-affected dogs, we sought to identify the genetic cause of PRA in this breed. RESULTS: Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data of three PRA-affected LA and three LA without signs of PRA did not identify any exonic or splice site variants, suggesting the causal variant was non-exonic. We subsequently undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which identified a 1.3 Mb disease-associated region on canine chromosome 33, followed by whole-genome sequencing analysis that revealed a long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) insertion upstream of the IMPG2 gene. IMPG2 has previously been implicated in human retinal disease; however, until now no canine PRAs have been associated with this gene. The identification of this PRA-associated variant has enabled the development of a DNA test for this form of PRA in the breed, here termed PRA4 to distinguish it from other forms of PRA described in other breeds. This test has been used to determine the genotypes of over 900 LA dogs. A large cohort of genotyped dogs was used to estimate the allele frequency as between 0.07-0.1 in the UK LA population. CONCLUSIONS: Through the use of GWAS and subsequent sequencing of a PRA case, we have identified a LINE-1 insertion in the retinal candidate gene IMPG2 that is associated with a form of PRA in the LA dog. Validation of this variant in 447 dogs of 123 breeds determined it was private to LA dogs. We envisage that, over time, the developed DNA test will offer breeders the opportunity to avoid producing dogs affected with this form of PRA.","Hitti-Malin, Rebekkah J; Burmeister, Louise M; Ricketts, Sally L; Lewis, Thomas W; Pettitt, Louise; Boursnell, Mike; Schofield, Ellen C; Sargan, David; Mellersh, Cathryn S",BMC Genet,,36

Research data on COVID-19 are understandably sparse in Africa. Nigeria, like most African countries, is battling a disease she is poorly equipped to fight. METHODS: The current available literature on COVID-19 was reviewed in relation to obstetric practice in the Nigerian context, gaps were identified, and recommendations were made to improve the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigerian obstetric practice. RESULTS: In and out of hospital, both the obstetrician and the obstetric patient are constantly being put at risk of exposure to the coronavirus because testing and preventive measures are either ineffective or non-existent. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has exposed the gross inadequacies in Nigeria's healthcare system and is therefore a wake-up call to the need for a complete overhaul of infrastructure and services.

METHODS: Development of the IRP involved a collaborative process between project staff, CEIRS center directors or their designees, and NIAID CEIRS leadership (referred to as the Pandemic Planning Advisory Committee [PPAC]). Project staff identified and summarized the response capabilities of each center and then worked with the PPAC to identify and rank research priorities for an emergency response using a modified Delphi method. RESULTS: Key elements of the response plan include tables of response capabilities for each CEIRS center, a framework that outlines and ranks research priorities for CEIRS during an emergency situation, and an operational strategy for executing the research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: The CEIRS IRP highlights the importance of enhancing science preparedness in advance of an influenza pandemic or other influenza-related zoonotic incident to ensure that research can be carried out expeditiously and effectively in emergency situations and to improve global health security.","Moore, Kristine A; Ostrowsky, Julia T; Mehr, Angela J; Osterholm, Michael T",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,36

To date, there are no such studies on Swedish adolescents. As COVID-19 emerged in the middle of our ongoing 2-year follow-up examination of the Study of Adolescence Resilience and Stress, we had the unique opportunity to use the corona outbreak as a 'natural experiment' to study the impact of COVID-19 on 15-year-old adolescents in Sweden. METHODS: Adolescents (baseline age 13.6±0.4 years) were recruited from schools in western Sweden (during the COVID-19 outbreak schools were kept open for those under 16 years of age). The COVID-19 pandemic reached Sweden on 31 January 2020. A total of 1316 adolescents answered the 2-year follow-up survey before (unexposed to COVID-19 pandemic, controls) and 584 after 1 February 2020 (COVID19-exposed). Data on stress, psychosomatic symptoms, happiness, relationships with parents and peers, school and health behaviours were collected. RESULTS: Adolescents reported higher levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms and lower levels of happiness at follow-up compared to baseline. These changes occurred to a similar extent in both the control and COVID-19-exposed groups. Likewise, the COVID-19-exposed group showed no deterioration in peer relations or relations with parents versus controls. We did not find any significant differences between groups regarding sleep duration and physical activity.

In the current study, we used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to assess the response to fear within health staff in Mexico. This was a cross-sectional survey study in which we administered the Spanish version of the FCV-19S to hospital staff. The FCV-19S is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of fear caused by COVID-19. A total of 2860 participants-1641 female and 1218 male personnel from three hospitals-were included in the study. The internal reliability of the scale was good, with Cronbach's alpha of .902. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the seven items of the FCV-19S, showing good model fit (&#967; 2 (7) = 29.40, p < .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .03; SRMR = .010; AIC = 71.40). We found a global FCV-19S mean score of 19.3 ± 6.9, with a significant difference in scores between women and men. Our survey shows a significantly higher level of fear in nursing and administrative personnel, which may be explained by the nursing staff being in close contact with infected patients and the administrative staff lacking understanding of the possible implications of the infection, compared with nonclinical hospital personnel. Our results are consistent with those of other researchers. We must remember that fear is a reaction and that we must be courageous enough to trust validated infection prevention practices to provide the highest standard of care, in the safest environment that we can, for as long as we can.","García-Reyna, Benjamín; Castillo-García, Gilberto Daniel; Barbosa-Camacho, Francisco José; Cervantes-Cardona, Guillermo Alonso; Cervantes-Pérez, Enrique; Torres-Mendoza, Blanca Miriam; Fuentes-Orozco, Clotilde; Pintor-Belmontes, Kevin Josue; Guzmán-Ramírez, Bertha Georgina; Hernández-Bernal, Aldo; González-Ojeda, Alejandro; Cervantes-Guevara, Gabino",Int J Ment Health Addict,,36
243406,Reflection of epidemics on turkish minstrel poetry: The case of novel corona-virus (covid-19),2020,"Background: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has increased the burden on healthcare systems already strained by a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) as co-infection and dual presentation are occurring in syndemic settings. We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals. Methods: We performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB), PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature. Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these signatures. Putative ""COVID-19 risk scores"" were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19 disease severity states. Results: 35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0·005), 13 of which were validated in two independent datasets. FCN1 - and SPP1 -expressing macrophages enriched in BALF during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of co-infection. Interpretation: Our results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Sheerin, Dylan; Wang, Xutao; Johnson, W Evan; Coussens, Anna",,,36

244710,Legacy of COVID-19 - the opportunity to enhance surgical services for patients with colorectal disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the improvement of diagnosis and treatment level in various countries, more and more patients have been discharged after systematic treatment. In order to effectively promote the overall recovery of patients' physical and mental function and quality of life (QOL), the focus of clinical work should be gradually shifted to rehabilitation treatment. Dance-based mind-motor activities were defined as coordinated upright mind-motor movements that emphasize dynamic balance, structured through music or an inner rhythm (e.g., breathing) and distinctive instructions or choreography, and that involve social interaction. It has positive effects on motor function, lung function, psychological mood and other aspects, so it can be used as a safe alternative therapy for patients recovering from COVID-19. At present, there are no relevant articles for systematic review. METHODS: From its inception until March 2021, we will conduct a comprehensive electronic search, including Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Springer, EMBASE, Chinese Science Citation Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan-fang database. Two independent researchers will conduct article retrieval, screening, quality assessment, and data analysis through the Review Manager (V. 5.3.5). RESULTS: The results of this study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dance-based mind-motor activities for the improvement of QOL in COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of the study will provide an evidence to judge whether dance-based mind-motor activities is effective and safe for COVID-19 in recovery period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol will not evaluate individual patient information or infringe patient rights and therefore does not require ethical approval.

245417,COVID-19 aus Sicht der Infektiologie./ [COVID-19: Questions and answers from Infectious Diseases Specialty],2020,"AIMS: Air quality changes with human health risk assessment were investigated. METHODS: The measurement results obtained by the Regional Environmental Protection Inspectorate (REPI) in Kraków and our deposited particulate-matter (PM) analysis, as well as United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) methodology of risk assessment were used in the study. RESULTS: Annual pollutant contents kept decreasing, with the exception of O3. However, the permissible annual levels were exceeded in the cases of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2. Increased contents of SO2, CO, C6H6, PM10, and PM2.5, as well as of As, Pb, Cd, Ni, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM particles during winter months indicated that house heating was the source of pollution. Due to no significant change in the monthly NO2 contents, this measurement was used as an indicator of traffic sources of pollution. In winter months, the allowable 24 h PM2.5 and PM10 contents were constantly exceeded. PM was identified as the most significant air pollutant. Enrichment factors revealed that deposited PM was enriched with heavy metals. The potential ecological risk (ERI) was determined to be very high for Cd, considerable for Zn, and low for As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Tl. The total non-carcinogenic risk indices (HQ) for both adults (HQ = 15.0) and children (HQ = 26.4) exceeded the acceptable value of 1. The total carcinogenic risk indices (CR) for both adults (CR = 1.51 × 10-4) and children (CR = 1.77 × 10-4) exceeded the acceptable level of 1 × 10-4. CONCLUSIONS: In the years 2005-2020, a general decreasing tendency of annual pollutant contents was observed. However, the permissible contaminant contents were still exceeded. PM2.5, BaP, PM10, and NO2 were determined as the most dangerous pollutants in inhalational pathway.","Traczyk, Paulina; Gruszecka-Kosowska, Agnieszka",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,36

In the context of clinical management for venous thromboembolism, this could result in suboptimal therapy with warfarin. We aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on utilization of International Normalized Ratio (INR) testing and the percentage of high and low results. METHODS: INR data from 11 institutions were extracted to compare testing volume and the percentage of INR results &#8805;3.5 and &#8804;1.5 between a pre-pandemic period (January-June 2019, period 1) and a portion of the COVID-19 pandemic period (January-June 2020, period 2). The analysis was performed for inpatient and outpatient cohorts. RESULTS: Testing volumes showed relatively little change in January and February, followed by a significant decrease in March, April, and May, and then returned to baseline in June. Outpatient testing showed a larger percentage decrease in testing volume compared to inpatient testing. At 10 of the 11 study sites, we observed an increase in the percentage of abnormal high INR results as test volumes decreased, primarily among outpatients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted INR testing among outpatients which may be attributable to several factors. Increased supratherapeutic INR results during the pandemic period when there was reduced laboratory utilization and access to care is concerning because of the risk of adverse bleeding events in this group of patients. This could be mitigated in the future by offering drive-through testing and/or widespread implementation of home INR monitoring.","Pearson, Lauren N; Johnson, Stacy A; Greene, Dina N; Chambliss, Allison B; Farnsworth, Christopher W; French, Deborah; Herman, Daniel S; Kavsak, Peter A; Merrill, Anna E; Lo, Sheng-Ying Margaret; Lyon, Martha E; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Schmidt, Robert L",J Appl Lab Med,,36

In this context, the following investigation is developed based on two objectives: (PO1) to know the level of anxiety in the face of death in these professionals; (PO2) to determine the predictive variables in the above-mentioned phenomenon. Professionals from all over Spain have participated in the study (n = 2079). From a quantitative perspective, a questionnaire was developed from the Collet-Lester death anxiety scale. The results show a total level of 69.2% in the scale, as well as some higher levels about the fear of death of others (82.1%) and the fear of the process of dying of others (78.2%). On the other hand, from the binary logistic regressions, four variables are evidenced that condition the risk of suffering death anxiety: (a) certainty of needing psychological treatment in the future; (b) absence of Individual Protection Equipment (PPE); (c) high levels of Emotional Exhaustion; (d) high levels of depersonalization-these last two come from the Maslach and Jackson Burnout scale. These data show a need for training and intervention in the emotional and psychological demands of the professionals of the Armed Forces and State Security Forces, as well as the obligation to develop a continuous dialogue with the institutions they represent to foster the feeling of belonging to them.

We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the Genalyte Maverick SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen Serology Panel compared to the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NC) qualitative immunoassay, using well characterized clinical serum samples. A total of 143 pre-pandemic sera and 48 sera collected from patients with a negative molecular SARS-CoV-2 result were used for specificity studies. For sensitivity analyses, 179 sera were used, obtained 3-7 days, 8-14 days, or ≥ 15 days after symptom onset from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specificity was determined to be 95.3% (182/191) for the Genalyte Maverick. Overall sensitivity of the Genalyte Maverick was similar to that observed for the Roche Elecsys NC test, 79.3% (142/179) vs. 76.5% (137/179), respectively. Genalyte Maverick trended, without statistical significance, towards higher sensitivity as compared to the Roche Elecsys NC test in the 3-7 days (11/25 vs. 9/25, respectively) and 8-14 days (21/28 vs. 19/28, respectively) post-symptom onset sample sets, but was identical in the ≥ 15 days post-symptom onset group (106/116 vs. 106/116, respectively). Therefore, the Genalyte Maverick serologic test had similar overall sensitivity to the Roche Elecsys NC assay, but may have slightly improved sensitivity for early seroconversion. The lower Genalyte Maverick specificity as compared to the Roche Elecsys NC assay as reported by other studies (&gt;99%), may necessitate confirmatory testing of positive Genalyte Maverick results if implemented for clinical use.","Donato, Leslie J.; Theel, Elitza S.; Baumann, Nikola A.; Bridgeman, Amber R.; Blommel, Joseph H.; Wu, Yanhong Karon Brad S.",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,,36

MERS-CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes a zoonotic disease, MERS, with strong camel to human and weak human to human transmission. The first documented case of MERS was reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. Viral replication produces inflammatory markers targeting T lymphocytes, with apoptosis being the end result. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of this virus is not yet fully understood. The main symptomatic appearance is of mild lower respiratory tract infection with dyspnea and persistent cough in addition to systemic manifestations. The diagnosis is mainly based on the use of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of viral ribonucleic acid in the sputum or tracheal fluids. Otolaryngologic treatment mainly involves supportive adjuvant usage of interferon or antiviral drugs; however, approximately one-third of patients may not survive, and, therefore, otolaryngologists should be familiar with and remain mindful of the disease.","Alnemare, Ahmad K",Int J Gen Med,,36

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported to share the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. Here, based on the public single-cell RNA-sequencing database, we analyzed the mRNA expression profile of putative receptor ACE2 and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) in the early maternal-fetal interface. The result indicates that the ACE2 has very low expression in the different cell types of early maternal-fetal interface, except slightly high in decidual perivascular cells cluster 1 (PV1). Interestingly, we found that the Zika virus (ZIKV) receptor AXL expression is concentrated in perivascular cells and stromal cells, indicating that there are relatively more AXL-expressing cells in the early maternal-fetal interface. This study provides a possible infection route and mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2- or ZIKV-infected mother-to-fetus transmission disease, which could be informative for future therapeutic strategy development.

This work mainly includes: (i) propose the concept about the first and the second waves of COVID-19, as well as study the case data and regularity of four cities; (ii) derive the existence and stability of the equilibrium, the parameter sensitivity of the model, and the existence of the optimal control strategy; (iii) carry out the numerical simulation associated with the theoretical results and construct a dynamic control strategy and verify its feasibility.","Lü, Xing; Hui, Hong-Wen; Liu, Fei-Fei; Bai, Ya-Li",Nonlinear Dyn,,36
254486,Roadmap: one anesthesiology department's strategic approach to COVID-19,2021,"The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for the rapid development of the aerospace industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable. To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We investigated two types of aerospace industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation. The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus improving the return on investment. The study is for the prediction of aerospace industries at pre-COVID-19 time. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences aerospace industries. The developed approach can be used to predict the share price of aerospace industries at post COVID-19 time.","Zheng, Linyu He Hongmei",Expert Systems with Applications,,36

The evaluation of laboratory findings including coagulation and inflammation parameters may represent a promising approach for early determination of COVID-19 severity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the present study, we aimed to identify laboratory parameters present upon admission in patients with COVID-19 related viral pneumonia and associated with an early in-hospital development of refractory respiratory failure or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring treatment in an intensive care unit. We investigated differences in the C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) between COVID-19 patients who had been transferred to an ICU within two weeks after admission (n = 82) and COVID-19 patients with stable course of the disease (n = 74). RESULTS: Multiple comparisons showed statistically significantly prolonged PT on admission in ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients (14.15 sec, median, CI 95% 13.4 ÷ 14.9) compared to the stable COVID-19 patients (13.25 sec, median, CI 95% 12.9 ÷ 13.6) (p-value = .0005). CRP levels upon admission were statistically significantly higher in ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients (132 mg/L, median, CI95% 113 ÷ 159) compared to the stable COVID-19 patients (51 mg/L, median, CI95% 33 ÷ 72) (p-value < .0001). On-admission fibrinogen and INR levels did not statistically significantly differ between ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients and stable COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: We suggest that CRP and PT levels present on admission in COVID-19 patients may be used as early prognostic markers of severe pneumonia requiring transfer to ICU.","Baranovskii, Denis S; Klabukov, Ilya D; Krasilnikova, Olga A; Nikogosov, Dimitri A; Polekhina, Natalia V; Baranovskaia, Delyara R; Laberko, Leonid A",Curr Med Res Opin,,36

We conducted the first nationwide population study using a probability-based sample to assess active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, combined with a longitudinal follow-up of the entire cohort over the next 6 months. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing results and the first 3-week follow-up results are presented. METHODS: A probability-based sample of the Slovenian population comprising data from 2.1 million people was selected from the Central Population Register (n = 3000). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples using the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay. Each participant filled in a detailed baseline questionnaire with basic sociodemographic data and detailed medical history compatible with COVID-19. After 3 weeks, participants were interviewed for the presence of COVID-19-compatible clinical symptoms and signs, including in household members, and offered immediate testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA if indicated. RESULTS: A total of 1368 individuals (46%) consented to participate and completed the questionnaire. Two of 1366 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (prevalence 0.15%; posterior mean 0.18%, 95% Bayesian confidence interval 0.03-0.47; 95% highest density region (HDR) 0.01-0.41). No newly diagnosed infections occurred in the cohort during the first 3-week follow-up round. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of active COVID-19 infections found in this study accurately predicted the dynamics of the epidemic in Slovenia over the subsequent month. Properly designed and timely executed studies using probability-based samples combined with routine target-testing figures provide reliable data that can be used to make informed decisions on relaxing or strengthening disease mitigation strategies.","Maver Vodicar, P; Ostrbenk Valencak, A; Zupan, B; Avsic Zupanc, T; Kurdija, S; Korva, M; Petrovec, M; Demsar, J; Knap, N; Strumbelj, E; Vehovar, V; Poljak, M",Clin Microbiol Infect,,36
255966,The rare reports of dermal filler reactions following the COVID-19 vaccine–and why it is still safe,2021,"The recent approval and distribution of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been a major development in the fight against the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The first two vaccines approved in the United States, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2, are both messenger RNA (mRNA) based and highly effective in immunocompetent persons, but efficacy in patients on immunosuppressants has not been established. Additionally, data suggests these patients are less likely than immunocompetent people to develop neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19 infection. Given the high risk of poor outcomes in organ transplant and immunosuppressed patients, effective vaccination is paramount in this group. We present the first reported case of a solid organ transplant patient who failed to achieve seroconversion after two doses of mRNA vaccine. This case has significant implications about how immunosuppressed patients should be counseled about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and the protection provided. Physicians should remain clinically suspicious for infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite vaccination status in solid organ transplant patients.","Rusk, Debra S; Strachan, Christian C; Hunter, Benton R",J Med Virol,,36

256140,COVID-19 in pregnancy,2020,"PURPOSE: The scope of this research endeavor was the determination of the applicability of over the counter mouthwash solutions in reducing the viral load in the saliva of COVID-19 patients and hence decreasing their infectivity. Beyond that, new experimental mouthwashes were investigated in terms of a possible positive immune modulation, which might offer an additional opportunity for a positive pharmaceutical effect. METHODS: The effectivity of the mouth washing solution was determined on 34 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring the viral load by RT-qPCR in pharyngeal swabs, which were taken before and after rinsing. The inflammatory modulation thru the experimental solutions was assayed in an in vitro model of virus infected nasopharyngeal epithelium cells. RESULTS: The clinical pilot study demonstrated that the mouth rinsing solution was able to reduce the viral load by about 90% in the saliva of most patients. This reduction was determined to persist for about 6 h. In the experimental solutions, the ingredients dexpanthenol and zinc were able to reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the cell culture model, while the antiviral response was not altered significantly. CONCLUSION: We recommend the application of mouth wash solutions to COVID-19 patients, since our results indicate a reduction in infectivity and might govern the protection of health care professionals. Further improvement to the over the counter formulation can be made by utilizing zinc and dexpanthenol, as they which might be beneficial for the patients' health.","Schürmann, Matthias; Aljubeh, Mohamed; Tiemann, Carsten; Sudhoff, Holger",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,36
256352,The global pandemic has permanently changed the state of practice for pre-DBS neuropsychological evaluations,2021,Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many cardiac rehabilitation centres to focus more on the remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) components. This increased focus and the lessons learned from this period could enhance the implementation of telerehabilitation and increase the participation in CR in Belgium.Methods: We conducted a survey between April and May 2020 about the implementation of telerehabilitation services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic questionnaire was sent via email to the heads of 42 Belgian CR centres. Three reminders via email were sent during the study period.Results: 27 CR centres (64%) returned completed questionnaires after three mailings. 52% of the CR centres provided remote CR services during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All CR centres that provided remote CR services delivered exercise training. The most used medium to deliver the CR components were online videos (71%) followed by online information on the website (64%) and emails (64%).Conclusion: It is interesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged many CR centres to implement remote delivery of CR components. This can help to speed up the research and implementation of telerehabilitation in daily clinical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic could be the push for a large multicentre implementation study that could prove that telerehabilitation is feasible and effective in the Belgian setting.,"Scherrenberg, Martijn; Frederix, Ines; De Sutter, Johan; Dendale, Paul",Acta Cardiol,,36

Covid-19 has badly affected the older population, identification of risk factors for severe disease and early intervention results in reduced mortality. Older adults may have a varied spectrum of presentation which ranges from mild to severe disease. Milder diseases are more in older adults without prior comorbidities whereas severity increases with increase in number of illness. Till date there is no definitive treatment and vaccines are also at different stages of trial only preventive methods and early detection of cases are important tools for fighting this pandemic. Dedicated centre's for elder care as well as trained geriatricians are very few in India. Prevention should be the most important strategy for older adults. Follow social distancing and maintain a distance of 1 meter from others even if you are healthy. Wash hands repeatedly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer and generous use of masks. Older adults should be encouraged to take their regular medication and the baseline disease should be under controlled. Frequent teleconsultation from the primary physician should be done repeatedly to identify the symptoms and also control of baseline disease. Considering Covid-19 increased mortality and severity in the older population we are providing practical suggestions for family physicians while managing elderly Covid patients.","Klanidhi, K.

257269,Associations Between Women's Obesity Status and Diminished Cutaneous Sensibility Across Foot Sole Regions,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, so understanding its biology and infection mechanisms is critical to facing this major medical challenge. SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity, and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.","Bayati, Armin; Kumar, Rahul; Francis, Vincent; McPherson, Peter S",J Biol Chem,,36

Design and settingA three-wave panel survey conducted in England in July 2020 (background survey), November 2020 (first measure of mobile app adoption), and March 2021 (continued use of app and new adopters) linked with official data. Primary outcomeRepeated measures of self-reported app usage. ParticipantsN = 2,500 adults living in England, representative of Englands population in terms of regional distribution, age, and gender (2011 census). ResultsWe observe initial app uptake at 41%, 95% CI [0.39,0.43], in November 2020 with a 12% dropout rate by March 2021, 95% CI [0.10,0.14]. We also found that 7% of nonusers as of wave 2 became new adopters by wave 3, 95% CI [0.05,0.08]. Initial uptake (or failure to use) of the app associated with social norms, privacy concerns, and misinformation about third-party data access, with those living in postal districts with restrictions on mobility less likely to use the app. Perceived lack of transparent evidence of effectiveness was associated with drop out of use. In addition, those who trusted the government were more likely to adopt in wave 3 as new adopters. ConclusionsSuccessful uptake of the contact tracing app should be evaluated within the wider context of the UK Governments response to the crisis. Trust in government is key to adoption of the app in wave 3 while continued use is linked to perceptions of transparent evidence. Providing clear information to address privacy concerns could increase uptake, however, the disparities in continued use among ethnic minority participants needs further investigation as differences are not fully explained via attitudinal measures.

As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated Covid-19, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field. We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in Covid-19; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Study selection and data abstraction was undertaken independently by two authors. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models to compute ratios of means with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Eight published studies and two preprints (n = 1798) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated Covid-19 compared with patients with noncomplicated disease (six studies; n = 1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2 = 100%). Consistent results were found in sensitivity analyses exclusively restricted to studies comparing patients requiring ICU admission vs no ICU admission (two studies; n = 540; ratio of means = 3.24; 95%CI, 2.54-4.14; P < .001; I2 = 87%). Nine of ten studies were assessed to have at least moderate risk of bias. In patients with Covid-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Inhibition of IL-6 may be a novel target for therapeutics for the management of dysregulated host responses in patients with Covid-19 and high-quality studies of intervention in this field are urgently required.","Coomes, Eric A; Haghbayan, Hourmazd",Rev Med Virol,,36
258255,Management of the dead during COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia,2020,"The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes. In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-&#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both &#916;9-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of Cannabis sativa that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant. These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids.

258724,Vitamin D and Covid-19: an update on evidence and potential therapeutic implications,2020,"The expansion of cities and their impacts currently constitutes a challenge for the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this respect, assessments of resource consumption and the delivery of appropriate policies to support resource conservation are of paramount importance. Previous works in the literature have focused on one specific resource (e.g., water, energy, food) at the household level, while others have analysed the inter-relations among different resources (i.e., the nexus approach) at larger spatial scales (e.g., urban level). Moreover, household behavioural attitudes are generally excluded while assessing resource consumption scenarios. This work overcomes previous limitations by proposing a causal-loop structure derived from the literature, from which simulations of different scenarios can be generated that consider the nexus between food, energy and water at the household level. These simulations can provide alternative scenarios to assess the impacts of monetary policies as well as education and communication actions on the enhancement of resource savings and consider both their current use and household preferences. The metropolitan area of Napoli was chosen as the testbed area for the simulations. The results, in relation to the testbed, proved that communication actions would be most appropriate to increase the level of resource savings. The business-as-usual scenario was especially sensitive to variations in individual preferences towards pro-environmental behaviours and showed their higher impacts on the results. Improvements of this method and its derived scenarios in the context of the urban planning process could support the implementation of informed policies towards the conservation of key resources and promotion of sustainable citizen behaviour.","Casazza, Marco; Xue, Jingyan; Du, Shupan; Liu, Gengyuan; Ulgiati, Sergio",PLoS One,,36
259063,"COVID-19 Situation Report, n.23 (31 August 2020)",2020,"Background and objectives: Quality of life (QoL) after breast cancer surgery is an important public health issue. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the levels of perceived quality of life in patients operated on for breast cancer in relation to the type of surgery, using the standardized questionnaires. Materials and Methods: We assessed 425 women after surgery for breast cancer. The assessment included the application of the WHOQOL-bref (The World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref), and FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast) questionnaires. The statistical analysis of the data included multiple linear regression and correlation tests. Results: Multiple linear regression analysis found that education, existence of comorbidities, time elapsed since surgery, and type of surgery were significant predictors of overall quality of life. Women's overall quality of life and general health has increased by 0.16 times for each subsequent year of surgery, and by 0.34 times for each subsequent higher education level. Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with breast reconstruction were statistically significant (ß = 0.18) compared to total mastectomy. Conclusions: There is a significant difference in the quality of life perceived by patients in whom the breast has been preserved or reconstructed in relation to patients in whom total mastectomy has been performed.","Kovacevic, Predrag; Miljkovic, Snezana; Visnjic, Aleksandar; Kozarski, Jefta; Jankovic, Radmilo",Medicina (Kaunas),,36
259606,"Protection against COVID-19 in African population: Immunology, genetics, and malaria clues for therapeutic targets",2021,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is a single-stranded positive polarity RNA virus with a high virulence effect. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the outermost component of the SARS CoV-2 virion and is important in the entry of the virus into the cell via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 plays an important role in the regulation of human blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictor angiotensin 2 to the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. In this study, the changes that mutations in Asian isolates may cause in S glycoprotein structure were analyzed and modeled to contribute to drug and vaccine targeting studies. Genome, proteome and mutation analyses were done using bioinformatics tools (MAFFT, MegaX, PSIPRED, MolProbity, PyMoL). Protein modelling was performed using ProMod3. We detected 26 mutations in the S glycoprotein. The changes that these mutations reveal in the general topological and conformational structure of the S glycoprotein may affect the virulence features of SARS CoV-2. It was determined that mutations converted the receptor binding domain (RBD) from down-formation to like-up formation. It is thought that conformational change occurring after mutation in RBD may cause an increase in receptor affinity. These findings could be beneficial for disease prevention of and drug/vaccine development for SARS CoV-2.","Akbulut, E.",Trakya University Journal of Natural Sciences,,36

Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources. The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.","Jalava, Katri",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,36

263361,Highlights in this issue,2020,"Computer-aided design (CAD) programs are essential to engineering as they allow for better designs through low-cost iterations. While CAD programs are typically taught to undergraduate students as a job skill, such software can also help students learn engineering concepts. A current limitation of CAD programs (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes) is that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students. To encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data generated from students using a free, open source CAD software called Aladdin to demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can predict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We challenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of an introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from 128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we tested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of design actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence actions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model achieved a>60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a zero net energy house. Our results suggest that it would be feasible for Aladdin to provide useful feedback to students when they are approximately halfway through their design. Further improvements to these models could lead to earlier predictions and thus provide students feedback sooner to enhance their learning.","Singh, Jasmine; Perera, Viranga; Magana, Alejandra J.; Newell, Brittany; Wei-Kocsis, Jin; Seah, Ying Ying; Strimel, Greg J.; Xie, Charles",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05955v1.pdf,36

However, little is known about the impact of social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the association between social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 456 singleton pregnant women in mainland China were recruited during January and February, 2020. Social-demographic characteristics, history of previous health, social media use, and current lifestyles was collected at baseline and the occurrence of miscarriage was followed up. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of miscarriage for women with different exposure of COVID-19-specipfic information. RESULTS: Among all the 456 pregnant women, there were 82 (18.0%) without any physical activities, 82 (18.0%) with inadequate dietary diversity, 174 (38.2%) with poor sleep quality, and 54 (11.8%) spending &#8805; 3 hours on reading COVID-19 news per day. Women with excessive media use (&#8805;3h) were more likely to be previous pregnant, never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality (all P<.05). The prevalence of miscarriage was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6%-19.4%). Compared with women who spent 0.5-2h (10.1%) on reading COVID-19 news per day, miscarriage prevalence in women who spent <0.5h (21.7%), 2-3h (19.7%) and &#8805;3h (31.5%) were higher (P<.05). Miscarriage prevalence was also higher in pregnant women with poor sleep quality (22.4% vs 12.1%, P<.05) and high educational level (17.9% vs 8.0%, P<.05). In the multivariable model, poor sleep quality (adjusted RR, 2.06; 95% CI: 1.24-3.44), 2-3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.97), and &#8805; 3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.43-4.59) were associated with miscarriage (all P<.05) (all P<.05). In the sensitivity analysis, results were still stable. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with excessive media use were more likely to be never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality. Excessive media use and poor sleep quality was associated with the higher risk of miscarriage. Our findings highlighted the importance of healthy lifestyles during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Xiaotong; Liu, Jue; Han, Na; Yin, Jing",,,36
264267,Is COVID-19 a Perfect Storm for Parkinson's Disease?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has triggered myriad efforts to dissect and understand the structure and dynamics of this complex pathogen. The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has received special attention as it is the means by which the virus enters the human host cells. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is one of the targeted regions of the Spike protein for therapeutics and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Though its function is not well-understood, the NTD is reported to acquire mutations and deletions that can accelerate the evolutionary adaptation of the virus driving antibody escape. Cellular processes are known to be regulated by complex interactions at the molecular level, which can be characterized by means of a graph representation facilitating the identification of key residues and critical communication pathways within the molecular complex. From extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire Spike for the wild-type and the dominant variant, we derive a weighted graph representation of the protein in two dominant conformations of the receptor-binding-domain; all-down and one-up. We implement graph theory techniques to characterize the relevance of specific residues at facilitating roles of communication and control, while uncovering key implications for fitness and adaptation. We find that many of the reported high-frequency mutations tend to occur away from the critical residues highlighted by our graph theory analysis, implying that these mutations tend to avoid targeting residues that are most critical for protein allosteric communication. We propose that these critical residues could be candidate targets for novel antibody therapeutics. In addition, our analysis provides quantitative insights of the critical role of the NTD and furin cleavage site and their wide-reaching influence over the protein at large. Many of our conclusions are supported by empirical evidence while others point the way towards crucial simulation-guided experiments.","Manrique, Pedro D; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Nguyen, Kien; Mansbach, Rachael; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, S.",,,36

DESIGN: Online survey methodology. SETTING: UK. PARTICIPANTS: 1038 UK adults were recruited who were either identified by UK government as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 or self-identified as at high risk with acute or other chronic health conditions not included in the UK government list. Participants were recruited through social media advertisements, health charities and patient organisations. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The awareness, attitudes and actions survey which explores the impact of COVID-19, on including access to healthcare, use of technology for health condition management, mental health, depression, well-being and lifestyle behaviours. RESULTS: Nearly half of the sample (44.5%) reported that their mental health had worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Management of health conditions changed including access to medications (28.5%) and delayed surgery (11.9%), with nearly half of the sample using telephone care (45.5%). Artificial Intelligence identified that participants in the negative cluster had higher neuroticism, insecurity and negative sentiment. Participants in this cluster reported more negative impacts on lifestyle behaviours, higher depression and lower well-being, alongside lower satisfaction with platforms to deliver healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on people identified as at high risk of severe illness. These findings should be considered by policy-makers and healthcare professionals to avoid unintended consequences of continued restrictions and future pandemic responses.","Flint, Stuart W; Brown, Adrian; Tahrani, Abd A; Piotrkowicz, Alicja; Joseph, Anny-Claude",BMJ Open,,36

METHODS: Samples were collected from 136 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia admitted to the Shanghai public health clinical center (116 mild, 20 severe). The concentrations of serum urea, Uric Acid (UA), Creatinine (CREA), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and urine protein (Pro) have been tested in this study. RESULTS: Higher levels of urea (female 7.00 ± 3.31, male 8.87 ± 5.18) Pro (female7/7, male 12/13), hs-CRP (female 2/7, male 5/13) ESR (female 94.43 ± 33.26, male 67.85 ± 22.77) were found in severe patients compared with the mild (urea: female 3.71 ± 1.00, male 4.42 ± 1.14; Pro: female 3/46, male 12/70; hs-CRP: female 1/46, male 3/70; ESR: female 43.32 ± 33.24, male 21.64 ± 21.82). UA is lower in the severe group (female 146.90 ± 54.01, male 139.34 ± 66.95) than in mild group (female 251.99 ± 64.35, male 339.81 ± 71.32). CREA and PCT did not show a significant difference between mild and severe patients, but the difference among the five biological markers (urea, Pro, hs-CRP, ESR, and UA) between mild and severe patients we tested was small (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 patients had higher levels of urea and Pro, while their UA levels were lower, reflecting poor kidney function in severe patients. However, higher levels of hs-CRP, ESR indicated that inflammatory responses were more active in severe patients.","Gao, Menglu; Wang, Qianying; Wei, Jianhao; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Li, Haicong",J Clin Lab Anal,,36

METHODS: We propose a reproducible method for creating high-resolution, quantitative slice phantoms. The phantoms are created using gels with different concentrations of NiCl2 and MnCl2 to achieve targeted T1 and T2 values. We describe a calibration method for accurately targeting anatomically realistic relaxation pairs. In addition, we developed a method of fabricating slice phantoms by extruding 3D printed walls on acrylic sheets. These procedures are combined to create a physical analog of the Brainweb digital phantom. RESULTS: With our method, we are able to target specific T1 /T2 values with less than 10% error. Additionally, our slice phantoms look realistic since their geometries are derived from anatomical data. CONCLUSION: Standardized and accurate tools for validating new techniques across sequences, platforms, and different imaging sites are important.

(Special issue: Drugs and COVID-19.),2020,"BACKGROUND: According to published data the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 is underestimated between 30 and 80%. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on total mortality of Poland and the Silesian voivodship. METHODS: Secondary epidemiological data on COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Ministry of Health registry and data on total mortality were gathered from the National Statistical Office and Registry Office in Poland. Three scenarios were used to estimated COVID-19 deaths: real number + an extra 30%, 60%, and 70% excess total deaths. RESULTS: In 2020, there were 73,254, 64,584, and 67,677 excess deaths in comparison to 2017-2019, respectively. For the Silesian voivodship, it was 8339, 7946, and 8701, respectively. The total mean increase in deaths was 16% for the whole country and the Silesian voivodship. The simulation for 30% extra COVID-19 deaths gave COVID-19 mortality equal to 12.5%; n = 50,708 deaths, for extra 60%; 17.9% n = 72,866 and for extra 70%; 19.7% n = 80,251 for Poland; and 11.9% (n = 6072), 17.2% (n = 8740), 24.2% (n = 12,297), respectively, for the Silesian voivodship. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of COVID-19 in total deaths should not exceed 20% for Poland and 24% for the Silesian voivodship in 2020.","Baranski, Kamil; Brozek, Grzegorz; Kowalska, Malgorzata; Kaleta-Pilarska, Angelina; Zejda, Jan Eugeniusz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,36

271137,Understanding COVID-19 immunity: reality and challenges,2020,"The challenge of COVID-19 has become more prevalent across the world. It is highly demanding an intelligent strategy to outline the precaution measures until the clinical trials find a successful vaccine. With technological advancement, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has extended its significant role in the development of remote medical point-of-care (RM-PoC). WMSN is generally located on a communication device to sense the vital signaling information that may periodically be transmitted to remote intelligent pouch This modern remote system finds a suitable professional system to inspect the environment condition remotely in order to facilitate the intelligent process. In the past, the RM-PoC has gained more attention for the exploitation of real-time monitoring, treatment follow-up, and action report generation. Even though it has additional advantages in comparison with conventional systems, issues such as security and privacy are seriously considered to protect the modern system information over insecure public networks. Therefore, this study presents a novel Single User Sign-In (SUSI) Mechanism that makes certain of privacy preservation to ensure better protection of multimedia data. It can be achieved over the negotiation of a shared session-key to perform encryption or decryption of sensitive data during the authentication phase. To comply with key agreement properties such as appropriate mutual authentication and secure session key-agreement, a proposed system design is incorporated into the chaotic-map. The above assumption claims that it can not only achieve better security efficiencies but also can moderate the computation, communication, and storage cost of some intelligent systems as compared to elliptic-curve cryptography or RSA. Importantly, in order to offer untraceability and user anonymity, the RM-PoC acquires dynamic identities from proposed SUSI. Moreover, the security efficiencies of proposed SUSI are demonstrated using informal and formal analysis of the real-or-random (RoR) model. Lastly, a simulation study using NS3 is extensively conducted to analyze the communication metrics such as transmission delay, throughput rate, and packet delivery ratio that demonstrates the significance of the proposed SUSI scheme.","Deebak, B D; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Nayyar, Anand",Multimed Tools Appl,,36
271263,Organic Electrosynthesis Towards Sustainability: Fundamentals and Greener Methodologies,2021,"The interventions and outcomes in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are highly varied. The disease and the interventions both impose costs and harm on society. Some interventions with particularly high costs may only be implemented briefly. The design of optimal policy requires consideration of many intervention scenarios. In this paper we investigate the optimal timing of interventions that are not sustainable for a long period. Specifically, we look at at the impact of a single short-term non-repeated intervention (a ""one-shot intervention"") on an epidemic and consider the impact of the intervention's timing. To minimize the total number infected, the intervention should start close to the peak so that there is minimal rebound once the intervention is stopped. To minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, leading to initial reduction and then having a rebound to the same prevalence as the pre-intervention peak rather than one very large peak. To delay infections as much as possible (as might be appropriate if we expect improved interventions or treatments to be developed), earlier interventions have clear benefit. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each subcommunity separately.","Di Lauro, Francesco; Kiss, István Z; Miller, Joel C",PLoS Comput Biol,,36

272628,Becoming anti-racist for the benefit of our patients,2020,"Background: Few studies have examined the effect of pandemics on suicide-related outcomes. Aims: We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. Method: We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6,683) and stratified sampling to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). Results: Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was very small. Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. Limitations: Because this was an Internet survey and subject to selection bias, the sample was not necessarily representative of the Japanese population. At the time of the survey, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. The dropout rate may have affected the results. Conclusion: Although the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.","Sueki, Hajime; Ueda, Michiko",Crisis,,36

At times, however, they are perceived as wasteful vaccums that deplete employee morale and productivity. Current meeting tools, to a great extent, have simplified and augmented the ways meetings are conducted by enabling participants to ``get things done'' and experience a comfortable physical environment. However, an important yet less explored element of these tools' design space is that of psychological safety -- the extent to which participants feel listened to, or motivated to be part of a meeting. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach would benefit the creation of new tools designed for retrofitting meetings for psychological safety. This approach comes with not only research opportunities -- ranging from sensing to modeling to user interface design -- but also challenges -- ranging from privacy to workplace surveillance.","Constantinides, Marios; Joglekar, Sagar; Quercia, Daniele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12976v1.pdf,36
273021,COVID-19 and cancer: How to protect 'the most vulnerable' during pandemic,2020,"Throughout the planet, the medical challenges posed by the pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 coronavirus have overlapped, inter alia, with the necessity to continue the academic process on every level. Romania was no exception. With the new vaccines against COVID-19, the hope of resuming face-to-face activity, considered as ‘normal’ before 2020, has emerged. In these circumstances, not at all far-fetched, certain questions have arisen, such as: should and must the online university education be completely removed? Should this form of education be continued? If so, to what extent? We have used econometric methods related to ARDL (auto regressive distributed lag models) such as pooled mean group (PMG) and mean group (MG) and used different tests for unit roots for the stationarity check of the series implied. The results show the positive effect of digitalisation on tertiary education and also the positive impact of the latter on sustainable development, as a base for future stimulation in public policies. The present study also aims to harness the university experience of these times, from some of the main Romanian university centres;the method used was a quantitative and qualitative research based on a questionnaire, which was answered by a number of 258 university teachers and 1569 students from prestigious public and private universities. The results of this analysis allowed us to conclude that most of the participants in the university educational process have adapted to the online activity, and the latter ‘saved’ the academic years 2019–2020 and, respectively, 2020–2021. The present study is useful for tertiary education institution and policymakers in terms of formulating strategies and policy recommendations to support teachers and students during any future pandemics.","Toader, Tudorel Safta Marieta Titirișcă Cristina Firtescu Bogdan",Sustainability,,36

To address the research gap, this study examined whether two types of rumination and perceived social support predict psychological distress during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities of the greater Daegu area (n=316) where the first massive outbreak in South Korea occurred and most residents underwent substantial disruption of daily life. They completed self-report questionnaires that included measures of psychological distress, event-related rumination, and social support. RESULTS: The hierarchical regression analysis showed that maladaptive intrusive rumination and perceived social support predicted increases and decreases in psychological distress, respectively, even when subjective severity of COVID-19-related experiences was controlled. Putatively adaptive type of rumination (i.e., deliberate rumination) was not a significant predictor concurrently. CONCLUSION: This is among the early endeavors to comprehensively understand risk and protective factors associated with an effective coping strategy against the COVID-19 crisis. Our results indicate that intrusive rumination aggravates but social support mitigates psychological distress during the pandemic, indicating that we can better adapt by differently attending to recent experiences and maintaining perceived social support.","Kang, Hyo Shin; Kim, Bin-Na",,,36

273662,Teamwork in the time of coronavirus: The MGH experience,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To establish and to evaluate the effectiveness of a three-tier screening process of depressive and anxiety disorders among children and adolescents with cancer based on questionnaires (first tier), semi-structured psychiatric interviews (second tier), and referral for psychiatric assessment and recommendations for treatment (third tier). We also aimed to determine the rates of depressive and anxiety disorders among participants. METHODS: Participants and their parents completed the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety modules. Then, they were interviewed separately using the semi-structured Affective and Anxiety Modules of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS). PROMIS cutoff values for diagnosing depressive and anxiety disorders, based on the K-SADS, were calculated by receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs). RESULTS: Of 91 participants 34 (37.4%) aged 7-21 years with cancer met the K-SADS criteria for depressive and/or anxiety disorders. The results of the ROC analyses were stronger for depressive disorders than for anxiety disorders and for more severe cases. The cutoff of 13 on the child-reported PROMIS for a major depressive episode had a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.82, and a cutoff of 14 on the child-reported PROMIS for generalized anxiety disorder had a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: Using the K-SADS, we found that anxiety and depressive disorders are very common in youngsters with cancer. The three-tier screening process we developed for depression and anxiety in this population provides practical cutoff values for identifying depressive and anxiety disorders in children with cancer.

273667,COVID-19 response may lead to lasting changes in cancer care,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality; large numbers of patients require intensive care, which is placing strain on health care systems worldwide. There is an urgent need for a COVID-19 disease severity assessment that can assist in patient triage and resource allocation for patients at risk for severe disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and scale a clinical decision support system and mobile app to assist in COVID-19 severity assessment, management, and care. METHODS: Model training data from 701 patients with COVID-19 were collected across practices within the Family Health Centers network at New York University Langone Health. A two-tiered model was developed. Tier 1 uses easily available, nonlaboratory data to help determine whether biomarker-based testing and/or hospitalization is necessary. Tier 2 predicts the probability of mortality using biomarker measurements (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer) and age. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 models were validated using two external datasets from hospitals in Wuhan, China, comprising 160 and 375 patients, respectively. RESULTS: All biomarkers were measured at significantly higher levels in patients who died vs those who were not hospitalized or discharged (P<.001). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 internal validations had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98), respectively. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 external validations had AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the validity of the clinical decision support system and mobile app, which are now ready to assist health care providers in making evidence-based decisions when managing COVID-19 patient care. The deployment of these new capabilities has potential for immediate impact in community clinics and sites, where application of these tools could lead to improvements in patient outcomes and cost containment.","McRae, Michael P; Dapkins, Isaac P; Sharif, Iman; Anderman, Judd; Fenyo, David; Sinokrot, Odai; Kang, Stella K; Christodoulides, Nicolaos J; Vurmaz, Deniz; Simmons, Glennon W; Alcorn, Timothy M; Daoura, Marco J; Gisburne, Stu; Zar, David; McDevitt, John T",J Med Internet Res,,36

274305,Inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 pathophysiology: Proteinase-activated and purinergic receptors as drivers and candidate therapeutic targets,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted health care systems' vulnerabilities. Hospitals face increasing risk of periods of scarcity of life-sustaining resources such as ventilators for mechanical respiratory support, as has been the case in Italy as of March, 2020. The National Academy of Medicine has provided guidance on crisis standards of care, which call for the reallocation of scarce medical resources to those who will benefit most during extreme situations. Given that this will require a departure from the usual fiduciary duty of the bedside clinician, we determined and mapped potential barriers to the implementation of the guidelines from stakeholders using an implementation science framework. Methods: A protocol was created to operationalize national and state guidelines for triaging ventilators during crisis conditions. Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted from July-September 2018 with clinicians at three acute care hospitals of an urban academic medical center. Respiratory therapists, intensivists, nursing leadership and the palliative care interdisciplinary team participated in focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted with emergency management, respiratory therapy and emergency medicine. Subjects were presented the protocol and their reflections were elicited using a semi-structured interview guide. Data from transcripts and notes were categorized using a coding strategy based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results: Participants anticipated that implementing this protocol would challenge their roles and identities as clinicians including both their fiduciary duty to the patient and their decision-making autonomy. Despite this, many participants acknowledged the need for such a protocol to standardize care and minimize bias as well as to mitigate potential consequences for individual clinicians. Participants identified the question of considering patient quality of life in triage decisions as an important and unresolved ethical issue in disaster triage. Conclusion: Clinicians' discomfort with shifting roles and obligations could pose implementation barriers for crisis standards of care.","Chuang, Elizabeth; Cuartas, Pablo A; Powell, Tia; Gong, Michelle Ng",AJOB Empir Bioeth,,36

275664,High proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections in air passengers to Brunei,2020,"INTRODUCTION: After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil Santamaría, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo Rodríguez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Albondiga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrochategi, Maitane",Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment (Engl Ed),,36

278744,COVID-19: Main therapeutic options,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of not inflated lung tissue (NILT) volume on the prognosis of patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: The clinical data of 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tianjin Third Central Hospital from March 2016 to June 2019 were collected. The basic data of patients, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), causes of ARDS, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), were collected. The CT imaging data of patients on the 1st and 7th day in the ICU were collected. According to the CT value, they were divided into hyperventilated areas (-1 000 to -900 HU), normal ventilation areas (-899 to -500 HU), poorly ventilated areas (-499 to -100 HU), and atelectasis area (-99 to 100 HU). The total lung volume and the percentage of NILT to the total lung volume (NILT%) were calculate. At the same time, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, total length of hospital stay were collected. According to the 28-day follow-up, they were divided into survival group and death group. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for 28-day death in ARDS patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, the area under ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to determine the accuracy of NILT% in predicting the 28-day prognosis of ARDS patients, and the NILT% threshold was used for subgroup analysis of patients. RESULTS: Among the 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, patients were excluded for more than 48 hours after ARDS diagnosis, repeated admission to ICU due to ARDS, the ICU duration less than 7 days, death within 72 hours of admission, chronic interstitial lung disease or congestive heart failure, no chest CT examination within 7 days of admission to ICU, and no specimen collection within 2 hours of admission to ICU. Finally, a total of 53 patients were enrolled in the analysis. Of the 53 patients, 31 patients survived and 22 patients died. The 28-day mortality was 41.5%. Compared with the survival group, patients in the death group were older (years old: 65.32±11.29 vs. 55.77±14.23), and had a higher SOFA score (11.68±3.82 vs. 8.39±2.23) with significant differences (both P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences in gender, BMI, ARDS cause, APACHE II score and PaO2/FiO2 between the two groups. There was no significant difference in CT value, total lung volume and NILT% between the two groups at 1st day after admission to ICU; NILT% on day 7 after admission to ICU in the death group was significantly higher than that in the survival group [(28.95±8.40)% vs. (20.35±5.91)%, P < 0.01], but there was no significant difference in CT value and total lung volume between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the 28-day prognosis of ARDS was related to age, SOFA score and NILT% independently [age: odds ratio (OR) = 0.892, 95%CI was 0.808-0.984, P = 0.023; SOFA score: OR = 0.574, 95%CI was 0.387-0.852, P = 0.006; NILT%: OR = 0.841, 95%CI was 0.730-0.968, P = 0.016]. ROC curve analysis showed that 7-day NILT% could predict the 28-day prognosis of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, and AUC was 0.810 (95%CI was 0.678-0.952, P < 0.01). The NILT% threshold was 15.50%, sensitivity was 95.5%, specificity was 80.6%, positive predictive value was 85.7%, and negative predictive value was 74.6%. According to the 7-day NILT% threshold, a subgroup analysis of patients was performed, and 7-day NILT% > 15.50% was defined as a high-risk clinical prognosis, and &#8804; 15.50% was a low-risk. Compared with low-risk patients (n = 7), the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay and total length of hospital stay in high-risk patients (n = 46) were significantly prolonged [duration of mechanical ventilation (days): 9.37±6.14 vs. 4.43±1.72, length of ICU stay (days): 12.11±5.85 vs. 7.57±1.13, total length of hospital stay (days): 18.39±5.87 vs. 11.29±2.22, all P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: The 7-day NILT% > 15.50% of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS after ICU admission is related to poor prognosis.","Lu, Xing; Han, Yuxin; Gao, Xinjing; Wang, Fengmei; Xu, Lei",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,36

Here, we establish an efficient human alveolosphere culture method and sphere-based drug testing platform for SARS-CoV-2. Alveolospheres exhibit indolent growth in a Wnt- and R-spondin-dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses reveal the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres express ACE2 and allow SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000-fold in 3 days of infection. Whereas lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, shows an anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable with the circulating drug level. These results demonstrate the validity of the alveolosphere culture system for the development of therapeutic agents to combat SARS-CoV-2.","Ebisudani, Toshiki; Sugimoto, Shinya; Haga, Kei; Mitsuishi, Akifumi; Takai-Todaka, Reiko; Fujii, Masayuki; Toshimitsu, Kohta; Hamamoto, Junko; Sugihara, Kai; Hishida, Tomoyuki; Asamura, Hisao; Fukunaga, Koichi; Yasuda, Hiroyuki; Katayama, Kazuhiko; Sato, Toshiro",Cell Rep,,36
279968,"Tuberculosis, COVID-19, and the End Tuberculosis strategy in India",2020,"Structures of power and inequality shape day-to-day life for individuals who are poor, imposing waiting in multiple forms and for a variety of services, including for healthcare (Andaya, 2018a; Auyero, 2012; Strathmann and Hay, 2009). Constraints, such as the age requirements for Medicare, losing employer-provided health insurance, or the bureaucracy involved in filing for disability often require people to wait to follow recommendations for medical treatments. In 2016-2017, we conducted 52 narrative interviews in St. Louis, a city with significant racial and economic health inequities and without Medicaid expansion. We interviewed people with one or more chronic illnesses for which they were prescribed medication and who identified as having difficulties affording their prescriptions. Throughout the interviews, participants frequently recounted 1) experiences of waiting for care, along with other services, and 2) the range of strategies they utilized to manage the waiting. In this article, we develop the concept of active waiting to describe both the lived experiences of waiting for care and the responses that people devise to navigate, shorten, or otherwise endure waiting. Waiting is structured into healthcare and other social services at various scales in ways that reinforce feelings of marginalization, and also that require work on the part of those who wait. While much medical and public health research focuses on issues of diagnostic or treatment delay, we conclude that this conceptualization of active waiting provides a far more productive frame for accurately understanding the emotional and physical experiences of individuals who are disproportionately poor and made to wait for their care. Only with such understanding can we hope to build more just and compassionate social systems.","Lee, Amanda A; James, Aimee S; Hunleth, Jean M",Soc Sci Med,,36

We conducted a study to address the following question: how has the pandemic impacted US clinicians' professional roles and relationships? DESIGN: Inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Clinical settings across the USA in April and May of 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians with leadership and/or clinical roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASURES: Emergent themes related to professional roles and relationships. RESULTS: Sixty-one clinicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Study participants were practising in 15 states across the USA, and the majority were White physicians from large academic centres. Three overlapping and inter-related themes emerged from qualitative analysis of interview transcripts: (1) disruption: boundaries between work and home life became blurred and professional identity and usual clinical roles were upended; (2) constructive adaptation: some clinicians were able to find new meaning in their work and described a spirit of collaboration, shared goals, open communication and mutual respect among colleagues; and (3) discord and estrangement: other clinicians felt alienated from their clinical roles and experienced demoralising work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians encountered marked disruption of their professional roles, identities and relationships during the pandemic to which they and their colleagues responded in a range of different ways. Some described a spirit of collaboration and camaraderie, while others felt alienated by their new roles and experienced work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust. Our findings highlight the importance of effective teamwork and efforts to support clinician well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Butler, Catherine R; Wong, Susan P Y; Vig, Elizabeth K; Neely, Claire S; O039,; Hare, Ann M",BMJ Open,,36

The aim of the present study was to study the impact of social distancing on physical activity level, and the association between mood state (depression and anxiety level) or sex with actual physical activity levels, the change in physical activity caused by social distancing period, the adhesion level to social distancing, the adoption time of social distancing, family income and age. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire with personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders information's was answered by 2140 Brazilians of both sex who were recruited through online advertising. RESULTS: The physical activity level adopted during the period of social distancing (3.5 ± 0.8) was lower than that the adopted prior to the pandemic period (2.9 ± 1.1, p < 0.001). Thirty percent of the participants presented symptoms of moderate/severe depression and 23.3% displayed moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. A greater presence of symptoms related to anxiety and depression were associated with low physical activity levels, low family monthly income, and younger age. A higher percentage of men who had no mood disorders was observed among those who were very active than among those less active. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on physical activity. Those who reduced their level of physical activity had the highest levels of mood disorders.

METHODS: We recruited, via Instagram, a sample of full-time college students aged 18-22 from across the U.S. We surveyed them in April (baseline; N = 707; mean age = 20.0, SD = 1.3) and July (follow-up) 2020. This study presents overall levels of perceived stress and general anxiety symptoms and inequalities across each of these outcomes by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and household income. We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. RESULTS: All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being. CONCLUSIONS: As colleges and universities think about how to manage and mitigate the infectious disease dimensions of COVID-19 among their student populations, they must also consider who is most at risk for increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Hoyt, Lindsay Till; Cohen, Alison K; Dull, Brandon; Maker Castro, Elena; Yazdani, Neshat",J. adolesc. health,,36

Vaccines have led to the complete eradication of smallpox and bovine plague and a major reduction in other infectious diseases including diphtheria, typhoid fever, poliomyelitis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis. While a few coronaviruses have been identified that seasonally infect humans by causing mild symptoms, the emergence of a new zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly triggered the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic responsible for widespread mortality. The severe phenotypes of COVID-19 resemble a previous infectious threat that was initially designated as hospital fever and puerperal fever, presently known as sepsis. A SARS-CoV-2 infection has frequently been considered as a form of viral sepsis (owing to common features with bacterial sepsis) but is also associated with an array of specific and unique symptoms. Rapid progress in anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, in particular, the design of efficient messenger RNA (mRNA) and recombinant adenovirus vaccines, is crucial for curbing the pandemic.","Cavaillon, Jean-Marc Osuchowski Marcin",Journal of Intensive Medicine,,36
283669,From snapshots to a movie. Challenging the patterns of academic research,2021,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of neurological complications and corresponding radiological findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature on COVID-19-associated neuroradiological findings and examine the prevalence of different findings in patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed. Any studies reporting CT or MRI neuroimaging findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Patient demographics, main radiological findings, neurological symptoms, and severity of COVID-19 infection were tabulated and quantified according to infection severity. RESULTS: Sixty-one studies published between 2019 and 2020 comprising 711 patients were analyzed according to severity of respiratory symptoms. The main neuroradiological findings for patients with mild classification were cranial nerve abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and white matter abnormalities, while the main findings in patients with severe classification were white matter abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSION: Neuroradiological manifestations in COVID-19 infection are highly heterogeneous and differ based on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Cranial nerve abnormalities appear exclusive to mild infection, with a high degree of olfactory tract involvement, while hemorrhagic events are more common in severe infection. Notably, ischemic infarction was equally prevalent in both mild and severe COVID-19 infection. Healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients should be aware of these potential complications and consider neurological assessment and neuroimaging studies when indicated.","Pan, Simon; Chen, Willam C; Baal, Joe D; Sugrue, Leo P",Acad Radiol,,36

Older age and several medical comorbidities are risk factors for COVID-19 complications. We report on an elderly man with a longstanding history of bipolar affective disorder associated with heavy smoking, alcohol abuse and multiple comorbidities, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrent pulmonary sepsis, who contracted COVID-19 during his inpatient treatment of a manic episode, and who fully recovered from COVID-19 without any need for respiratory support. We discuss how his excessive use of nicotine replacement therapy may have contributed to his emerging unscathed from COVID-19. Nicotine, an &#945;7-nACh receptor agonist, may boost the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and hinder the uncontrolled overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is understood to be the main pathway to poor outcomes and death in severe COVID-19.","Dratcu, Luiz; Boland, Xavier",Cureus,,36

We used the ROBINS-I tool or Cross-Sectional/Prevalence Study Quality tool from AHRQ, to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Nine studies (two prospective cohorts, four retrospective cohorts and three cross-sectional) were included and assessed the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 prognosis. Risk of bias of the included studies ranged from moderate to critical. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity among them precluded meta-analyses. Most of the included studies showed some degree of association to: (a) higher BMI and worse clinical presentation and (b) obesity and need of hospitalization. The results were inconsistent about the impact of obesity on mortality. Based on limited methodological quality studies, obesity seems to predict poor clinical evolution in patients with COVID-19. Further studies with appropriate prospective design are needed to reduce the uncertainty on this evidence.","Peres, Karina Colombera; Riera, Rachel; Martimbianco, Ana Luiza Cabrera; Ward, Laura Sterian; Cunha, Lucas Leite",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,36

Hospitals continued to provide emergency services and treatment for COVID-19 disease. Teaching hospitals like ours had another responsibility at hand;training of our surgical residents. Not allowing this pandemic to take away months of training, we resorted to online virtual training programs, for continuing academic activities. After having conducted thirty such sessions, we took feedback from the participating students and faculty members to evaluate the usefulness of this new initiative and identify the lacunae that needed to be addressed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The initial twenty classes were held on the GoTo Meeting (R) online platform, whereas the last ten were conducted using the Google Meet application. A 20-item questionnaire covering four broad domains of general perception, feasibility, knowledge gained, and drawbacks was circulated, and 19 responses were registered anonymously. Strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis was done based on the responses received. RESULTS: About 89.5% of the participants believed that online classes were the ideal platform for continuing education and 84.2% of the participants were overall satisfied with the whole exercise. The Achilles' heel was the availability of a good Internet connection, and the major lacunae were the poor quality of video and audio transmission. Seventy-four percent of the participants wanted to continue online training in the future too, whereas 26% wanted to revert to the traditional face-to-face teaching. CONCLUSION: Online virtual training classes are an effective and feasible alternative to traditional teaching in times such as these, which demanded strict social distancing. It naturally lacked the warmth and personal touch of the traditional teaching classes, but it allowed us to continue teaching our residents and also prepare them to face the biggest menace of all times.","Narain, T.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the host by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The role of ACE2 in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of debate, with clinical and experimental evidence indicating a multifaceted relationship between ACE2 activity and disease severity. Here, we review the mechanisms by which the peptidergic substrates and products of ACE and ACE2 contribute to physiological and pathophysiological processes and hypothesise how down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry disrupts homeostasis. A better understanding of the endocrinology of the disease, in particular the neuroendocrinology of ACE2 during COVID-19, may contribute to the timely design of new therapeutic strategies, including the regulation of ACE2 itself by steroid hormones, to ameliorate the severity of COVID-19.","Zhang, Limei; Zetter, Mario A; Guerra, Enrique C; Hernández, Vito S; Mahata, Sushil K; Eiden, Lee E",J Neuroendocrinol,,36
287310,Unwavering Regulatory Safeguards for COVID-19 Vaccines,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A growing number of antidiabetic agents have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), despite such trials being principally required to rule out excess cardiovascular risk. AREAS COVERED: This article addresses the Evaluation of Ertugliflozin Efficacy and Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes (VERTIS-CV) trial, its background, design, results, and implications. In patients at least 40 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the VERTIS-CV trial demonstrated ertugliflozin was non-inferior to placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events, though not superior. Ertugliflozin significantly reduced hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo. The composite renal outcome was not significantly different between groups. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile commensurate with other sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: In patients with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD, ertugliflozin appears safe with a noted non-significant trend toward improved renal outcomes. Approximately 23.7% of patients in the VERTIS-CV trial had heart failure, the highest among SGLT-2 inhibitor CVOTs. The VERTIS-CV trial reaffirms the reduction in heart failure hospitalizations as a likely class effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors. While the trial supports the use of ertugliflozin beyond glycemic control, agents with confirmed superiority for improved cardiovascular outcomes and mortality may be preferred.","Cowart, Kevin; Carris, Nicholas W",Expert Opin Pharmacother,,36

289311,100 years of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy: from cattle to COVID-19,2021,"As in almost every other branch of science, the major advances in data science and machine learning have also resulted in significant improvements regarding the modeling and simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems. It is nowadays possible to make accurate medium to long-term predictions of highly complex systems such as the weather, the dynamics within a nuclear fusion reactor, of disease models or the stock market in a very efficient manner. In many cases, predictive methods are advertised to ultimately be useful for control, as the control of high-dimensional nonlinear systems is an engineering grand challenge with huge potential in areas such as clean and efficient energy production, or the development of advanced medical devices. However, the question of how to use a predictive model for control is often left unanswered due to the associated challenges, namely a significantly higher system complexity, the requirement of much larger data sets and an increased and often problem-specific modeling effort. To solve these issues, we present a universal framework (which we call QuaSiModO: Quantization-Simulation-Modeling-Optimization) to transform arbitrary predictive models into control systems and use them for feedback control. The advantages of our approach are a linear increase in data requirements with respect to the control dimension, performance guarantees that rely exclusively on the accuracy of the predictive model, and only little prior knowledge requirements in control theory to solve complex control problems. In particular the latter point is of key importance to enable a large number of researchers and practitioners to exploit the ever increasing capabilities of predictive models for control in a straight-forward and systematic fashion.","Peitz, Sebastian; Bieker, Katharina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04722v1.pdf,36

291388,Low type I interferon response in COVID-19 patients: Interferon response may be a potential treatment for COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: African American adolescent females are disproportionately affected by STIs and HIV. Given the elevated risk of STIs and HIV for African American women, there is an urgent need to identify innovative strategies to enhance adoption and maintenance of STI and HIV preventive behaviors. Texting is a promising technology for creating preventive maintenance interventions (PMIs) that extend the efficacy of the original intervention. However, little guidance in the public health literature is available for developing this type of application. OBJECTIVE: We describe a formative pilot study that incorporates user experience (UX) methods to design and test PMI texts for Afiya, an original evidence-based intervention (EBI) specifically designed for African American adolescent females. The purpose of this study is to describe the adaptation process of the health educator-lead phone calling to text-based communication. METHODS: The formative process followed the ADAPT-ITT framework for adapting EBI and using them in a new setting, for a new target population, or a modified intervention strategy. This study presents the details of how the phases of the ADAPT-ITT framework were applied to the design of the adaptation. An advisory board (AB) from the target population was constituted, consisting of six African American women ages of 18 - 24 years, participating in formative activities for 12 weeks, involving components of the PMI design. As Afiya included a telephone-based PMI, developers of the original Afiya consultation scripts crafted the initial design of the SMS-based text and texting protocol. The AB participated in the one-day Afiya workshop, followed by 4 weeks of texting PMI messages, a mid-course focus group, followed by 4 more weeks of texting PMI messages, ending with a final focus group. At the advisory board's request, this phase included an optional, additional week of text-based PMI messages. RESULTS: The methods provided a rich source of data and insights into the fundamental issue involved when constructing SMS-based PMI for this target population, and for this EBI. Prior contact and context are essential, as the health educator was identified as a key persona in the process and the messages were situated in the original (workshop) context. Narrative adaptations for personas emerged from AB discussions. Suggestions on how to expand the PMI to current, specific social contexts indicated the use of narrative analysis is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: The use of existing EBI incorporating telephone-based PMI scripts facilitated the initial design of the texts, with subsequent narrative analysis of the AB data providing additional adjustments given the actual context. Post-analysis revealed that personas would offer insight and opportunities for persona-specific modification of texting narratives.","Davis, Teaniese; DiClemente, Ralph Joseph; Prietula, Michael",,,36

Recent Findings: Data are emerging that highlight the extent of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 patients, including evidence that SARS-CoV-2 causes myocarditis and increases cardiac risk. The incidence of cardiac injury is much greater in patients with severe disease presentation and those in intensive care. Summary: During the past year, COVID-19 patient mortality rates have improved due to tailored pharmacological treatments and patient management strategies that address the unique presentation of symptoms, which will hopefully also reduce the incidence of cardiac injury.","Bugert, Christina L; Kwiat, Victoria; Valera, Isela C; Bugert, Joachim J; Parvatiyar, Michelle S",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,,36

The complement system is part of the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, which many viruses can evade or employ to mediate cell entry. The immunopathology and acute lung injury orchestrated through the influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils can be directly activated by complement components to prime an overzealous cytokine storm. The manifestations of severe COVID-19 such as the ARDS, sepsis and multiorgan failure have an established relationship with activation of the complement cascade. We have collected evidence from all the current studies we are aware of on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis and the preceding literature on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection linking severe COVID-19 disease directly with dysfunction of the complement pathways. This information lends support for a therapeutic anti-inflammatory strategy against complement, where a number of clinically ready potential therapeutic agents are available.","Polycarpou, Anastasia; Howard, Mark; Farrar, Conrad A; Greenlaw, Roseanna; Fanelli, Giorgia; Wallis, Russell; Klavinskis, Linda S; Sacks, Steven",EMBO Mol Med,,36
296656,A Retrospective analysis of DIC score and SIC score in prediction of COVID-19 severity,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In addition to physical damage, COVID-19 also has a serious impact on the mental health of society. For many people, this involves the necessity of adapting to new conditions, uncertainty about the future and a tremendous mental burden. It was investigated whether there were any differences between the 2 measures (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) in the levels of perceived stress, anxiety, life satisfaction and experienced emotions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study, conducted in Poland and the Netherlands, involved 168 people. The metric, the Positive and Negative Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were used. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-immigrants living in Poland (N = 50), Dutch citizens (N = 56), and Polish immigrants living in the Netherlands (N = 62). RESULTS: The level of stress and negative emotions was higher in the groups of Poles living in Poland and Poles living in the Netherlands than in the group of Dutch citizens. Therefore, access to psychological care should be improved during the pandemic, especially for immigrants, due to the increased risk of developing stress-induced mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In the groups of Poles, there was an increase in perceived stress and trait anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of Dutch citizens experienced a reduction in the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group of Polish immigrants, there was an increase in life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bujek-Kubas, Iwona Celina; Mojs, Ewa",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,36

298375,Predicted uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in USA,2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: In the initial period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of patients seeking care in the emergency department. A first step in estimating the impact of these changes is to characterize the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. METHODS: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics, visit characteristics, and diagnoses for all ED patient visits to an urban level 1 trauma center before and after a state emergency declaration and comparing them with a similar period in 2019. We estimated percent change on the basis of the ratios of before and after periods with respect to 2019 and the decline per week using Poisson regression. Finally, we evaluated whether each factor modified the change in overall ED visits. RESULTS: After the state declaration, there was a 49.3% decline in ED visits overall, 35.2% (95% confidence interval -38.4 to -31.9) as compared with 2019. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients, as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, and abdominal and back pain. Significant proportional increases were seen in ED visits for upper respiratory infections, shortness of breath, and chest pain. CONCLUSION: There have been significant changes in patterns of care seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in ED visits, especially for certain demographic groups and disease processes, should prompt efforts to understand these phenomena, encourage appropriate care seeking, and monitor for the morbidity and mortality that may result from delayed or deferred care.","Westgard, Bjorn C; Morgan, Matthew W; Vazquez-Benitez, Gabriela; Erickson, Lauren O; Zwank, Michael D",Ann Emerg Med,,36

This is a pilot study of remote coaching and assessment of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) manual skills in obstetrics and gynecology residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PGY-3 obstetrics and gynecology residents participated in remote assessment of FLS manual skills using a live streaming platform. Learners who showed deficiencies in proficiency participated in live-streamed coaching sessions. The coaching sessions continued until the learner and coach mutually agreed that the learner was prepared for the skills portion of the FLS certification exam. The primary outcome was learner performance on skills assessment with external validation through the FLS manual skills exam pass rate. RESULTS: One learner demonstrated proficiency at baseline and the remaining nine underwent remote coaching sessions. Learners received a mean of two coaching sessions to reach mutually agreed readiness for the FLS exam as per learner and coach. All residents performed significantly better at the conclusion of the remote coaching series (11.3 ± 0.82) as compared to their baseline scores (8.8 ± 2.82) (P < .03; 95% CI, 0.31-4.69). Proficiency was externally validated through the FLS exam taken by each resident 1-2 weeks following their final assessment, with all learners passing the manual portion. The average satisfaction of learners with remote coaching was 77/100 (range 50-100). 100% of learners felt prepared for their FLS certification exam and 100% would recommend this remote training program to a colleague. CONCLUSION: Remote coaching and assessment of FLS skills yields similar results to traditional face-to-face instruction.","Miles, Shana; Donnellan, Nicole",Mil. med,,36

However, COVID-19 related risk in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has not been studied yet. We evaluated the safety of breast cancer surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the West of Scotland region. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having breast cancer surgery was carried out in a geographical region during the first eight weeks of the hospital lockdown and outcomes were compared to the regional cancer registry data of pre-COVID-19 patients of the same units (n = 1415). RESULTS: 188 operations were carried out in 179 patients. Tumour size was significantly larger in patients undergoing surgery during hospital lockdown than before (cT3-4: 16.8% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.001; pT2 - pT4: 45.5% vs. 35.6%; p = 0.002).

COVID-19 pandemic has claimed about one million deaths in less than a year. However, it is unclear whether exposure to acute and chronic air pollution influences the COVID-19 epidemiologic curve. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies listed in six electronic databases between December 2019 and September 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Studies presented as original articles, studies that assessed risk, incidence, prevalence, or lethality of COVID-19 in relation with exposure to either short-term or long-term exposure to ambient air pollution were included. All patients regardless of age, sex and location diagnosed as having COVID-19 of any severity were taken into consideration. We synthesised results using harvest plots based on effect direction. RESULTS: Included studies were cross-sectional (n = 10), retrospective cohorts (n = 9), ecological (n = 6 of which two were time-series) and hypothesis (n = 1). Of these studies, 52 and 48% assessed the effect of short-term and long-term pollutant exposure, respectively and one evaluated both. Pollutants mostly studied were PM2.5 (64%), NO2 (50%), PM10 (43%) and O3 (29%) for acute effects and PM2.5 (85%), NO2 (39%) and O3 (23%) then PM10 (15%) for chronic effects. Most assessed COVID-19 outcomes were incidence and mortality rate. Acutely, pollutants independently associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality were first PM2.5 then PM10, NO2 and O3 (only for incident cases). Chronically, similar relationships were found for PM2.5 and NO2. High overall risk of bias judgments (86 and 39% in short-term and long-term exposure studies, respectively) was predominantly due to a failure to adjust aggregated data for important confounders, and to a lesser extent because of a lack of comparative analysis. CONCLUSION: The body of evidence indicates that both acute and chronic exposure to air pollution can affect COVID-19 epidemiology. The evidence is unclear for acute exposure due to a higher level of bias in existing studies as compared to moderate evidence with chronic exposure. Public health interventions that help minimize anthropogenic pollutant source and socio-economic injustice/disparities may reduce the planetary threat posed by both COVID-19 and air pollution pandemics.","Katoto, Patrick D M C; Brand, Amanda S; Bakan, Buket; Obadia, Paul Musa; Kuhangana, Carsi; Kayembe-Kitenge, Tony; Kitenge, Joseph Pyana; Nkulu, Celestin Banza Lubaba; Vanoirbeek, Jeroen; Nawrot, Tim S; Hoet, Peter; Nemery, Benoit",Environ Health,,36
301470,Childhood Obesity in the Pacific: Challenges and Opportunities,2020,"The aim of this study was to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in neurosyphilis (NS), analyze the differences between asymptomatic NS (ANS) and symptomatic NS (SNS), and explore the diagnostic value of these cytokines. We enrolled 45 patients with a diagnosis of NS, including 18 patients with ANS and 27 patients with SNS, whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected before penicillin therapy. Twelve patients with syphilis but non-NS (NNS) were also included. We measured the CSF levels of interleukin- (IL-) 1ß, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-21, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) &#945;; the CSF levels of the microglial activation marker soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2); and the CSF levels of the neuronal injury marker neurofilament light proteins (NFL) using the human cytokine multiplex assay or ELISA. Of the measured cytokines in the CSF, only IL-10 levels were significantly increased in NS patients compared to NNS patients (p < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, the CSF levels of IL-10 were significantly elevated in SNS patients compared to ANS and NNS patients (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively). The CSF IL-10 levels had a significant correlation with the markers of microglial activation and neuronal injury, and they also correlated with CSF rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer, CSF white blood cell (WBC) count, and CSF protein concentration. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF IL-10 in the diagnosis of NS and ANS were 0.920 and 0.891, respectively. The corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 86.7%/91.7% and 83.3%/91.7%, respectively. Therefore, the excessive production of IL-10 might facilitate bacterial persistent infection, play an important role in the pathogenesis of NS, and associate with the progression of the disease. CSF IL-10 concentration had a useful value in the diagnosis of NS, especially in ANS.","Li, Wurong; Wu, Wenqing; Chang, Haoxiao; Jiang, Meijuan; Gao, Junhua; Xu, Yun; Xu, Dongmei; Yin, Linlin; Zhang, Xinghu",Biomed Res Int,,36

303109,The Physics Inventory of Quantitative Literacy: A tool for assessing mathematical reasoning in introductory physics,2020-09-23,"We study an urban bike lane planning problem based on the fine-grained bike trajectory data, which is made available by smart city infrastructure such as bike-sharing systems. The key decision is where to build bike lanes in the existing road network. As bike-sharing systems become widespread in the metropolitan areas over the world, bike lanes are being planned and constructed by many municipal governments to promote cycling and protect cyclists. Traditional bike lane planning approaches often rely on surveys and heuristics. We develop a general and novel optimization framework to guide the bike lane planning from bike trajectories. We formalize the bike lane planning problem in view of the cyclists' utility functions and derive an integer optimization model to maximize the utility. To capture cyclists' route choices, we develop a bilevel program based on the Multinomial Logit model. We derive structural properties about the base model and prove that the Lagrangian dual of the bike lane planning model is polynomial-time solvable. Furthermore, we reformulate the route choice based planning model as a mixed integer linear program using a linear approximation scheme. We develop tractable formulations and efficient algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problem. Via a real-world case study with a city government, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and quantify the trade-off between the coverage of bike trips and continuity of bike lanes. We show how the network topology evolves according to the utility functions and highlight the importance of understanding cyclists' route choices.

304300,Case finding strategies under National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP),2020,"BACKGROUND: The variability of Covid-19 severity between patients has driven efforts to identify prognosticating laboratory markers that could aid clinical decision-making. Procalcitonin is classically used as a diagnostic marker in bacterial infections, but its role in predicting Covid-19 disease severity is emerging. We aimed to identify the association between procalcitonin and Covid-19 disease severity in a critical care setting and whether bacterial co-infection is implicated. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Covid-19 patients with procalcitonin concentrations measured in a critical care setting at our institution between February and September 2020. Laboratory markers including peak procalcitonin values and a range of bacterial culture results were analysed. Outcomes were the requirement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as well as inpatient mortality. RESULTS: In total, 60 patients were included; 68% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 45% died as inpatient. Univariate analysis identified higher peak procalcitonin concentrations significantly associated with both the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, P = 0.02) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.6, P = 0.03). Higher peak procalcitonin concentrations was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.4, P = 0.03). There was a significant positive correlation between increased peak procalcitonin concentrations and duration on invasive mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between peak procalcitonin concentrations of patients with positive and negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated procalcitonin concentrations in Covid-19 patients are associated with respiratory failure requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and inpatient mortality. This association may be independent of bacterial co-infection.","Heer, Randeep S; Mandal, Amit Kj; Kho, Jason; Szawarski, Piotr; Csabi, Peter; Grenshaw, Dawn; Walker, Ian Al; Missouris, Constantinos G",Ann Clin Biochem,,36
304800,"Covid-19: Current knowledge, disease potential, prevention and clinical advances",2020,"It has long been suggested that NO may inhibit an early stage in viral replication. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Despite smoking being listed as a risk factor to contract Covid-19, only a low proportion of the smokers suffered from SARS-corona infection in China 2003, and from Covid-19 in China, Europe and the US. We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO2 concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO. Specialized iNO machines can now be developed to provide the drug intermittently in short bursts at high concentration dose, which would then provide both a preventative drug for those at high risk, as well as an effective treatment, without the health hazards associated with smoking.","Hedenstierna, Göran; Chen, Luni; Hedenstierna, Magnus; Lieberman, Robert; Fine, David H",Nitric Oxide,,36

The pairwise sequence comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro indicated similarity percentages of 82.59% and 30.06% with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro , respectively. In comparison with SARS-CoV PLpro , in SARS-CoV-2, the PLpro had a conserved catalytic triad of C111, H278, and D293, with a slightly lower number of polar interface residues and of hydrogen bonds, a higher number of buried interface sizes, and a lower number of residues that interact with ubiquitin and PLpro . These features might contribute to a similar or slightly lower level of deubiquitinating activity in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. It was, however, a much higher level compared to MERS-CoV, which contained amino acid mutations and a low number of polar interfaces. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro showed almost the same catalytic site profiles, interface area compositions and polarities, suggesting a general similarity in deubiquitination activity. Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 had a higher potential for binding interactions with ubiquitin. These estimated parameters contribute to the knowledge gap in understanding how the new virus interacts with the immune system.","Kandeel, Mahmoud; Kitade, Yukio; Fayez, Mahmoud; Venugopala, Katharigatta N; Ibrahim, Abdelazim",J. med. virol,,36
306906,Retrospective study of COVID-19 seroprevalence among tissue donors at the onset of the outbreak before implementation of strict lockdown measures in France,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 has had an enormous impact worldwide and is still spreading. Globally confirmed infections have surpassed 41.1 million, of which more than 1 million resulted in deaths. Considering the relationship between public health disasters and emotional disorders, it is essential to examine psychological well-being related to this pandemic. METHOD: We performed a systematic search on psychological problems from PubMed to 10 October 2020, and conducted a meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V.3 software. RESULTS: The results showed a 19.4% and 26.8% pooled incidence for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, during the SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-related coronavirus outbreaks. However, overall prevalence of depression was somewhat higher at 27.0% during the COVID-19 period. The pooled incidence of PTSD during COVID-19 compared with SARS and MERS outbreaks, was lower, at 16.4%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there are shared and distinct psychological responses following SARS, MERS and COVID-19, and show pessimistic estimates of a wide range of potentially upcoming psychological problems.","Fan, Fang Cheng; Zhang, Shu Yao; Cheng, Yong",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,36

308982,A novel strain of coronavirus: What nurses need to know (Updated),2020,"PCR has been widely used in different fields including molecular biology, pathogen detection, medical diagnosis, food detection and etc. However, the difficulty of promoting PCR in on-site point-of-care testing reflects on challenges relative to its speed, convenience, complexity, and even cost. With the emerging state-of-art of microfluidics, rapid PCR can be achieved with more flexible ways in micro-reactors. PCR plays a critical role in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under this special background of COVID-19 pandemic, this review focuses on the latest rapid microfluidic PCR. Rapid PCR is concluded in two main features, including the reactor (type, size, material) and the implementation of thermal cycling. Especially, the compromise between speed and sensitivity with microfluidic PCR is explored based on the system ratio of (thermal cycling time)/(reactor size). Representative applications about the detection of pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 viruses based on rapid PCR or other isothermal amplification are discussed as well.","Dong, Xiaobin; Liu, Luyao; Tu, Yunping; Zhang, Jing; Miao, Guijun; Zhang, Lulu; Ge, Shengxiang; Xia, Ningshao; Yu, Duli; Qiu, Xianbo",Trends Analyt Chem,,36

309609,A Comprehensive Summary of the Knowledge on COVID-19 Treatment,2021,"In line with SARS and MERS, the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest challenges in medicine and health care worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 provides numerous therapeutic targets, each of them promising, but not leading to the success of therapy to date. Neither an antiviral nor an immunomodulatory therapy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 or pre-exposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 has proved to be effective. In this review, we try to close the gap and point out the likely relationships among lysosomotropism, increasing lysosomal pH, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and disease process, and we deduce an approach for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)/cytokine storm triggered by bacteria or viruses. Lysosomotropic compounds affect prominent inflammatory messengers (e.g., IL-1B, CCL4, CCL20, and IL-6), cathepsin-L-dependent viral entry of host cells, and products of lysosomal enzymes that promote endothelial stress response in systemic inflammation. As supported by recent clinical data, patients who have already taken lysosomotropic drugs for other pre-existing conditions likely benefit from this treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic. The early administration of a combination of antivirals such as remdesivir and lysosomotropic drugs, such as the antibiotics teicoplanin or dalbavancin, seems to be able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transition to COVID-19.","Blaess, Markus; Kaiser, Lars; Sauer, Martin; Csuk, René; Deigner, Hans-Peter",,,36
309742,Could Moderate-intensity Exercise Training Be a Prophylactic Collaborative Agent during Covid-19 Era?,2020,"BACKGROUND: This qualitative research explored the lived experiences of patients who experienced postponement of elective cardiac and vascular surgery due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We know very little about patients during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Understanding the patient voice may play an important role in prioritization of postponed cases and triage moving forward. METHODS: Utilizing a hermeneutical phenomenological qualitative design, we interviewed 47 individuals who experienced a postponement of cardiac or vascular surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed and informed by phenomenological research methods. RESULTS: Patients in our study described 3 key issues around their postponement of elective surgery. Patients described robust narratives about the meanings of their elective surgeries as the chance to ""return to normal"" and alleviate symptoms that impacted everyday life. Second, because of the meanings most of our patients ascribed to their surgeries, postponement often took a toll on how patients managed physical health and emotional well-being. Finally, paradoxically, many patients in our study were demonstrative that they would ""rather die from a heart attack"" than be exposed to the coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several components of the patient experience, encompassing quality of life and other desired benefits of surgery, the risks of COVID, and difficulty reconciling the 2. Our study provides significant qualitative evidence to inform providers of important considerations when rescheduling the backlog of patients. The emotional and psychological distress that patients experienced due to postponement may also require additional considerations in postoperative recovery.","Byrnes, Mary E; Brown, Craig S; De Roo, Ana C; Corriere, Matthew A; Romano, Matthew A; Fukuhara, Shinichi; Kim, Karen M; Osborne, Nicholas H",Med Care,,36

Human amniotic products have a broad immune-mediating profile. Observing that many COVID-19 patients have a profound inflammatory response to the virus, we sought to determine the influence of human amniotic fluid (hAF) on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A 10-patient case series was IRB-approved to study the impact of hAF on hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19. Nine of the 10 patients survived to discharge, with one patient succumbing to the disease when enrolled on maximal ventilatory support and severe hypoxia. The study design was altered by the IRB such that the last 6 patients received higher dose of intravenous hAF. In this latter group, patients that had observed reductions in C-reactive protein were associated with improved clinical outcomes. No hAF-related adverse events were noted. Acknowledging some of the inherent limitations of this case series, these results inform and catalyze a larger scaled randomized prospective trial to further investigate hAF as a therapy for COVID-19.

The present study's purpose was to assess the frequency, characteristics, effects, and contributing factors of workplace violence (WPV) committed against HCWs in AlKarak Governmental Hospital (KGH), South Jordan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 382 HCWs (170 physicians and 212 nurses) working in the KGH, Jordan, during January and February 2021, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The current study showed that most participants (65.5%) reported exposure to WPV, mainly verbal violence (52.0%), and patients' relatives were the principal perpetrators in most incidents. The regular reporting of these incidents is deficient. The victims suffered psychological and physical effects. These assaults on healthcare facilities highlight the importance of effective risk communication at all levels of society to minimize anxiety, stigma, and, eventually, WPV.

311409,Immunology of COVID-19 and its clinical implications for therapy y,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia is a common surgical emergency. Restoration of blood flow is a critical objective of treating this pathology. However, many patients suffer from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries at the time of revascularization, requiring prolonged hospitalizations. B-1a cells are a subtype of B lymphocytes with roles in regulating inflammation and tissue injury by spontaneous release of natural IgM and IL-10. We hypothesized that treatment with B-1a cells protects mice from intestinal I/R. METHODS: Mesenteric ischemia was induced in mice by placing a vascular clip on the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. At the time of reperfusion, B-1a cells or PBS control were instilled into the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of mice. PerC lavage, blood, intestine, and lungs were collected 4 h after reperfusion. Serum organ injury and inflammatory markers such as ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, IL-6, as well as lung and gut histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed. RESULTS: In intestinal I/R, B-1a cell frequency and number in the PerC were significantly decreased compared to sham-operated mice. There was an increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, and IL-6 when comparing the vehicle group with the sham group. These increases were significantly reduced in the B-1a cell treated group. B-1a cell treatment significantly decreased the intestine and lung injury scores as well as MPO content, compared to vehicle treated mice. B-1a cell treatment resulted in a reduction of apoptotic cells in these tissues. Serum IgM levels were decreased in intestinal I/R, while treatment with B-1a cells significantly increased their levels towards normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: B-1a cell treatment at the time of mesenteric reperfusion ameliorates end organ damage and reduces systemic inflammation through the improvement of serum IgM levels. Preserving B-1a cells pool could serve as a novel therapeutic avenue in intestinal I/R injury.","Royster, William; Ochani, Mahendar; Aziz, Monowar; Wang, Ping",J Surg Res,,36

313623,Invited Review: The spectrum of neuropathology in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This paper is aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). METHODS: The demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and prognosis from 15 cases of pSS-LIP patients were retrospectively analyzed. The data were compared with t test, &#967;2 test, and Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) Fifteen cases of patients with pSS-LIP are all females (100%). Compared with pSS with interstitial lung disease(pSS-ILD) patients, the incidence of dry cough, dental caries is higher in pSS-LIP patients. The incidence of shortness of breath, weight loss, and crackles is lower in pSS-LIP patients than that of pSS-ILD patients. (2) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, pSS-LIP patients had higher percentage of patients with ANA, anti-SSA52KD antibody, anti-SSA60KD antibody, and anti-SSB antibody, and the higher concentration of serum globulin. (3) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, the frequency of obstructive ventilation dysfunction is significantly higher and the frequency of diffusion dysfunction is significantly lower in pSS-LIP patients. (4) The most frequent HRCT findings in patients with pSS-LIP is cysts (100%), followed by ground-glass opacities (73.3%), nodular shadow (73.3%) among the pSS-LIP patients. Compared with PSS-ILD patients, the incidence of pulmonary nodule shadow is significantly higher in PSS-LIP patients, while that of grid shadow was significantly lower. (5) Compared with the baseline, the sum of the number, maximum diameter, and diameter of cysts in three levels of pSS-LIP patients showed an increasing trend after treatment. (6) Correlation analysis: The changes of ground-glass opacities were positively correlated with using GC or not, and those were negatively correlated with the dose of GC treatment. Besides, there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the maximum diameter of cysts (â³Ømax1/t) and the use of CTX; there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the total diameter of cysts (â³Øsum1/t) and the use of CTX. CONCLUSION: To the patients of pSS-LIP, female were more common than male, and the onset of LIP was usually more insidious. Hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. The appearance of ground-glass opacities in pSS-LIP patients suggests that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increases, which may cause airway compression, the expansion of terminal bronchioles, and the formation of cysts. The more ground-glass opacities appear earlier, and the more appearance of new cysts later. Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage. The heavier ground-glass opacity is at baseline, the more likely it will recur during maintenance treatment. So follow-up closely is needed. Key Points â¢ It is the first clinical study with more cases of patients with pSS-LIP. â¢ Female and hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. â¢ Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. â¢ Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage.","Dong, Xin; Gao, Yan-Li; Lu, Yong; Zheng, Yi",Clin. rheumatol,,36

METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional web-based survey. A validated questionnaire to assess the changes in lifestyle-related behaviour was administered on adults across India using a Google online survey platform. RESULTS: A total of 995 responses (58.5% male, mean age 33.3 years) were collected. An improvement in healthy meal consumption pattern and a restriction of unhealthy food items was observed, especially in the younger population (age <30 years). A reduction in physical activity coupled with an increase in daily screen time was found especially among men and in upper-socio-economic strata. Quarantine induced stress and anxiety showed an increase by a unit in nearly one-fourth of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 marginally improved the eating behaviour, yet one-third of participants gained weight as physical activity declined significantly coupled with an increase in screen and sitting time.

In its simplest form, the Poletti model adds one differential equation, motivated by evolutionary game theory, to the SIR model. The new equation describes the evolution of a variable $x$ that represents the fraction of the population using normal behavior. The remaining fraction $1-x$ uses altered behavior such as staying home, social isolation, mask wearing, etc. Normal behavior offers a higher payoff when the number of infectives is low; altered behavior offers a higher payoff when the number is high. We show that the entry-exit function of geometric singular perturbation theory can be used to analyze the model in the limit in which behavior changes on a much faster time scale than that of the epidemic. In particular, behavior does not change as soon as a different behavior has a higher payoff; current behavior is sticky.

UVGI method had good biocidal efficacy on FFRs (> 3 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) combined with inexpensive, readily available equipment; however, it was more time-consuming to ensure sufficient reduction in SARS-CoV-2. MGS treatment also provided good viral decontamination on FFRs (> 4 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) along with less time-intensive process and readily available equipment while inconsistent disinfection on the treated surfaces and deterioration of nose cushion of FFRs were observed. HPGP was a good virucidal system (> 6 log10 reduction of Vesicular stomatitis virus) but filtration efficiency after decontamination was inconsistent. Overall, HPV appeared to be one of the most promising methods based on the high biocidal efficacy on FFRs, preservation of respirator performance after multiple cycles, and no residual chemical toxicity. Nonetheless, equipment cost and time of the HPV process and a suitable operating room need to be considered.","Thaper, Ravinder; Fagen, Brendan; Oh, Jonghwa",Photochem Photobiol Sci,,36
318840,Covid-19 treatment: Investigation on the phytochemical constituents of Vernonia amygdalina as potential Coronavirus-2 inhibitors,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In 2020, the COVID-19 appeared in Italy with an exponential transmission capacity and serious consequences for the whole population. To counter the spread of the virus, the Italian government has adopted an extensive lockdown, forcing citizens to stay at home and avoid social contact. The COVID-19 quarantine represents a unique phenomenon in the recent centuries, and its long-term consequences on people's lives and mental health are still to be understood. This study aimed to explore significant experiences of people who did not contract the virus, yet experienced the quarantine as a potentially stressful condition. METHODS: Italians who did not contract the COVID-19 were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique. Interviews were designed to capture the significant experiences related to the lockdown period in Italy. Participants were asked to describe the most significant (1) negative and (2) positive critical events that they personally experienced during the ongoing quarantine. Such events were meant to provide information on their experience of the quarantine as a whole. The audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed following Critical Incident Technique's indications. RESULTS: Twenty two participants described a total of 43 critical events, including 22 negative episodes and 21 positive events experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Three categories emerged from the negative episodes and four categories emerged from the positive events described by the participants. Relevant themes both positive and negative concerned mostly relationships (with partners, family, and friends), and the alteration of everyday activities, Also a specific ""sensation of emergency"" that the participants felt during the pandemic emerged, as an emotionally-charged response to quarantine-related external stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first in-depth qualitative study investigating the significant negative and positive events that people experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Future research could employ analogous event recollection methods but focus on other populations (e.g., fragile subjects or on other national contests), in order to extend the information on the quarantine experience and its possible long-lasting effects.","Durosini, Ilaria; Triberti, Stefano; Savioni, Lucrezia; Pravettoni, Gabriella",PLoS One,,36

Here, we introduce an ultrasensitive chip-based antigen test with single protein biomarker sensitivity for the differentiated detection of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A antigens in nasopharyngeal swab samples at diagnostically relevant concentrations. The single-antigen assay is enabled by synthesizing a brightly fluorescent reporter probe, which is incorporated into a bead-based solid-phase extraction assay centered on an antibody sandwich protocol for the capture of target antigens. After optimization of the probe release for detection using ultraviolet light, the full assay is validated with both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A antigens from clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (PCR-negative spiked with target antigens). Spectrally multiplexed detection of both targets is implemented by multispot excitation on a multimode interference waveguide platform, and detection at 30 ng/mL with single-antigen sensitivity is reported.","Stambaugh, Alexandra; Parks, Joshua W; Stott, Matthew A; Meena, Gopikrishnan G; Hawkins, Aaron R; Schmidt, Holger",Proc.

The number of patients confirmed to have this disease has exceeded 9 million in more than 215 countries, and more than 480 600 have died as of 25 June 2020. Coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s and have recently been identified as the cause of a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 and a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The current SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recently identified. Patients with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic. Typical symptoms include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea have been reported; neurologically related symptoms, particularly anosmia, hyposmia and dysgeusia, have also been reported. Physical examination may find fever in over 44% of patients (and could be documented in over 88% of patients after admission), increased respiratory rate, acute respiratory disease and maybe decreased consciousness, agitation and confusion.

322470,The US Regulatory System and COVID-19 Vaccines: The Importance of a Strong and Capable FDA,2021,"Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, it has rapidly spread around the world. Persons with asymptomatic disease exhibit viral shedding, resulting in transmission, which presents disease control challenges. However, the clinical characteristics of these asymptomatic individuals remain elusive. We collected samples of 25 asymptomatic and 27 symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Viral titers of throat swabs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). COVID-19 IgG and IgM were examined. Complete blood counts were determined, and serum biochemistry panels were performed. Cytokines, including gamma interferon (IFN-Î³), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. Although similar viral loads were detected, asymptomatic patients had significantly faster virus turnover than symptomatic patients. Additionally, asymptomatic patients had higher counts of lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells. While liver damage was observed in symptomatic patients, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and decreased liver-synthesized proteins in the blood, asymptomatic patients showed normal liver measurements. Lactate dehydrogenase, a COVID-19 risk factor, was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients. These results suggest that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients had normal clinical indicators and faster viral clearance than symptomatic patients. Lymphocytes may play a role in their asymptomatic phenotype. Since asymptomatic patients may be a greater risk of virus transmission than symptomatic patients, public health interventions and a broader range of testing may be necessary for the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential problem for pandemic control through public health strategies. Our results demonstrate that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients have better outcomes than symptomatic patients. This may have been due to more active cellular immune responses and normal liver function. Since asymptomatic patients have no clinical symptoms which can easily prevent timely diagnosis and treatment, they may cause a greater risk of virus transmission than symptomatic patients, which poses a major challenge to infection control. Evidence suggests that nonpharmaceutical public health interventions, like social distancing and face mask ordinances, play important roles in the control of COVID-19. Looking forward, it may be necessary to proceed cautiously while reopening businesses in areas of epidemicity to prevent potential waves of COVID-19 in the future.","Han, Huan; Xu, Zaichao; Cheng, Xiaoming; Zhong, Youquan; Yuan, Li; Wang, Fubing; Li, Yan; Liu, Fang; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",MSphere,,36

Following the discovery of the initial CRISPR/Cas-based system, the technology has been advanced to facilitate a multitude of different functions. These include development as a base editor, prime editor, epigenetic editor, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) gene regulators. It can also be used for chromatin and RNA targeting and imaging. Its applications have proved revolutionary across numerous biological fields, especially in biomedical and agricultural improvement. As a diagnostic tool, CRISPR has been developed to aid the detection and screening of both human and plant diseases, and has even been applied during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CRISPR/Cas is also being trialed as a new form of gene therapy for treating various human diseases, including cancers, and has aided drug development. In terms of agricultural breeding, precise targeting of biological pathways via CRISPR/Cas has been key to regulating molecular biosynthesis and allowing modification of proteins, starch, oil, and other functional components for crop improvement. Adding to this, CRISPR/Cas has been shown capable of significantly enhancing both plant tolerance to environmental stresses and overall crop yield via the targeting of various agronomically important gene regulators. Looking to the future, increasing the efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and limiting off-target activity are two major challenges for wider application of the technology. This review provides an in-depth overview of current CRISPR development, including the advantages and disadvantages of the technology, recent applications, and future considerations.","Li, Chao; Brant, Eleanor; Budak, Hikmet; Zhang, Baohong",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,36

The incidence of COVID-19 in the Lombardy population was obtained from the National Institute of Statistics. Confirmed COVID-19 was defined by nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The survey was circulated amongst 955 patients (531 rheumatoid arthritis, 203 psoriatic arthritis, 181 spondyloarthritis, and 40 of connective tissue diseases/vasculitides/autoinflammatory diseases; mean age 53.7 years; female: 67.4%). The rate of responders was 98.05%. The incidence of confirmed COVID-19 is consistent with the general population (0.62% vs 0.66%; p=0.92). None of the patients had severe complications or required intensive care treatment, and all of them temporarily discontinued ongoing ts/bDMARDs therapy. Almost all patients adopted precautions to prevent the contagion (90.6%) and maintained the ongoing treatment with ts/bDMARDs (93.2%). The disease activity remained stable in 89.5% of patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who came to the ED over a period of 2 months and were diagnosed with possible COVID-19. We analyzed clinical and epidemiologic variables, treatments given in the ED, discharge destination, need to revisit, and reasons for revisits. Patients who did or did not revisit were compared, and factors associated with revisits were explored. RESULTS: The 2378 patients included had a mean age of 57 years; 49% were women. Of the 925 patients (39%) discharged, 170 (20.5%) revisited the ED, mainly for persistence or progression of symptoms. Sixty-six (38.8%) were hospitalized. Odds ratios (ORs) for the following factors showed an association with revisits: history of rheumatologic disease (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.10-7.99; P = .03), digestive symptoms (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.14-2.63; P = .01), respiratory rate over 20 breaths per minute (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.0-1.06; P = .05), and corticosteroid therapy given in the ED (OR, 7.78; 95% CI, 1.77-14.21, P = .01).

This outbreak, and the subsequent containment policies, may have a range of potential short- and long-term impacts on the monitoring and surveillance of other conditions, such as birth defects. In this commentary, we provide a perspective on these potential impacts on birth defects surveillance and analysis. We discuss possible effects on clinical birth defect diagnoses, routine birth defects surveillance system activities, and epidemiologic considerations, as well as opportunities for mitigating the impact of COVID-19. Like many other sectors of public health and medicine, birth defects surveillance programs may be faced with organizational and methodological obstacles in the wake of a changing landscape. A better understanding of these potential challenges faced by birth defects surveillance programs could facilitate better planning and collaboration across programs to overcome barriers to core activities and to prepare for novel opportunities for research and prevention.","Ludorf, Katherine L; Salemi, Jason L; Kirby, Russell S; Tanner, Jean Paul; Agopian, A J",Birth Defects Res,,36

329173,Quarantining arriving travelers in the era of COVID-19: balancing the risk and benefits a learning experience from Bahrain,2021,"BACKGROUND: Similar to other countries, the government of Germany has implemented various restrictions of social life in March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This results in millions of people being isolated for long periods, which may increase feelings of worry and anxiety. As the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is an often used dysfunctional strategy to cope with such feelings, these restrictions might cause an increase of consumption. Already at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown can increase the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the future. However, up to now little is known about the changes in alcohol-drinking behavior and tobacco smoking in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To address this theme, we investigated the changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption in the German population aged between 18 and 80 years via an online survey. RESULTS: In total, 3,245 persons participated in the survey; 35.5% of them reported an increase in drinking during the lockdown (42.9% did not change their drinking behavior, 21.3% drank less, and 0.3% started drinking). The odds of consuming more alcohol during lockdown were associated with middle age, higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lower agreement with the importance of the restrictions, and consuming alcohol more than once per week before the lockdown. Also, 45.8% of the participants increased their smoking during the lockdown. The odds of smoking more during lockdown were associated with higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is important to start campaigns to inform the general population about potential long-term effects of increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and to raise the health-care professionals' awareness of this topic.","Koopmann, Anne; Georgiadou, Ekaterini; Reinhard, Iris; Müller, Astrid; Lemenager, Tagrid; Kiefer, Falk; Hillemacher, Thomas",Eur Addict Res,,36

330047,View From My Window,2020,"The interactions of history, geography, domestic policies, and geopolitics have contributed to the chronic and pervasive poverty that many African countries find themselves in. The unrelenting HIV and AIDS pandemic and as of 2020, COVID 19 pandemic, has devastated the social fabric, and older persons, women, children, and youths, and people with disabilities are among the most impoverished. Poverty alleviation has been deeply intertwined with social work's endeavors to enhance people's social functioning. Moreover, social workers have an ethical responsibility to assist the poor and marginalized in society (Dhemba 2012b). Social work is, therefore, a welfare profession with a concern for social justice and human wellbeing, consequently, given that the primary concern of the majority of social work service users is poverty (Twikirize, Spitzer, Wairire, Mabeyo, and Rutikanga (2014). Nonetheless, the relevance and effectiveness of social work depends on its ability to address the endemic poverty, which is the root cause of most social problems. Poverty reduction and its eventual eradication are therefore, the sine qua non of social work education and practice which is why many African countries have shifted from welfare to a developmental focus. To this end, some countries on the African continent have renamed their public welfare ministries to ministries or departments of social development. In the same vein, the social work curriculum at many Universities in Southern Africa, including Eswatini, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe have social development as one of the core courses. This article examines social work education, training, and practice in Southern Africa, focusing on Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Lesotho, and Zimbabwe. The article interrogates the social work curriculum's responsiveness and fitness of practitioners to address the pervasive poverty in these countries. The article is grounded on the developmental social work approach as advocated by proponents such as Gray (2017), Mupedziswa (2001), and Midgley (2010), amongst other scholars. This article's methodology is framed on a review of the social work curriculum and research and policy documents on poverty in Southern Africa. Furthermore, the article offers pathways on how to embed poverty mitigation in social work education and practice. This is particularly important in guiding interventions for the realisation of the Global Social Work Agenda's desired outcomes.","Dhemba, Jotham Nhapi Tatenda Goodman",Social Work and Society,,36
330136,"AI-driven quantification, staging and outcome prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia",2021,"Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) are found inside the cellular niche at the tip of the ovary. They undergo asymmetric divisions to renew the stem cell lineage and to produce sibling cystoblasts that will in turn enter differentiation. GSCs and cystoblasts contain spectrosomes, membranous structures essential to orientate the mitotic spindle and that, particularly in GSCs, change shape depending on the cell cycle phase. Using live imaging and a GFP fusion of the spectrosome component Par-1, we follow the complete spectrosome cycle throughout GSC division and quantify the relative duration of the different spectrosome shapes. We also determine that the Par-1 kinase shuttles between the spectrosome and the cytoplasm during mitosis and observe the continuous addition of new material to the GSC and cystoblast spectrosomes. Next, we utilise the Fly-FUCCI tool to define in live and fixed tissues that GSCs have a shorter G1 compared to the G2 phase. The observation of centrosomes in dividing GSCs allowed us to determine that centrosomes separate very early in G1, prior to centriole duplication. Furthermore, we show that the anterior centrosome associates with the spectrosome only during mitosis and that, upon mitotic spindle assembly, it translocates to the cell cortex, where it remains anchored until centrosome separation. Finally, we demonstrate that the asymmetric division of GSCs is not an intrinsic property of these cells, since the spectrosome of GSC-like cells located outside of the niche can divide symmetrically. Thus, GSCs display unique properties during division, a behaviour influenced by the surrounding niche.","Villa-Fombuena, Gema; Lobo-Pecellín, María; Marín-Menguiano, Miriam; Rojas-Ríos, Patricia; González-Reyes, Acaimo",Development (Camb.),,36

However, it is yet unknown if gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM)'s IPV risk has increased during this time. This article describes and analyzes IPV experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of coupled-GBMSM in the United States. We hypothesized that pandemic-driven stressors would be associated with increased IPV prevalence and severity. A sample of 214 coupled men living in the US who had previously participated in HIV-related couple studies was surveyed in July-September 2020. Respondents reported demographic, sexual and substance use behaviors, and relationship characteristics. Surveys also collected data on pandemic-related life-changes (employment, substance use, COVID-19 illness). IPV victimization and perpetration were measured with the Gay and Bisexual Men Intimate Partner Violence scale and measured individually experienced or perpetrated violence, sexual, emotional, monitoring, or controlling behaviors, and if a given behavior was new and/or had changed in frequency during the pandemic. Reported prevalence and pandemic-related changes in victimization and perpetration were described. New or more frequent IPV victimization was modeled against employment, substance use changes, COVID-19 illness, and outside sexual partners (modified by a couple's sexual agreement). IPV perpetration prevalence was 15.17%, 34.44% of which was new or more frequent. Victimization prevalence was 14.95%, of which 46.88% was new or more frequent. After adjustment, outside sexual partners were associated with IPV among those with nonmonogamous sexual agreements; each outside sexual partner increased the odds of new or more frequent victimization by 70% (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.16, 2.51]). Given this study's documented rise in IPV among a sample of coupled men, additional research into IPV predictors, interventions, and support strategies in GBMSM populations are warranted.","Walsh, Alison R; Sullivan, Stephen; Stephenson, Rob",J Interpers Violence,,36

METHODS: The case of a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis is presented to illustrate unique clinical decisions made in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cadaveric temporal bone was used to simulate droplet spread during suctioning of fluorescein-labelled middle ear fluid and visualized with a blue-light filter. RESULTS: A 23-year-old male who presented with complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis was found to have an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, with positive viral PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, and a negative PCR of the middle ear fluid. He was placed on isolation precautions and treated with myringotomy, topical and systemic antibiotics, and antivirals. Consistent with observations during endonasal suctioning, suctioning of middle ear fluid was not found to be aerosol or droplet generating. CONCLUSION: The case of a patient with active COVID-19 presenting with complicated acute otitis media in whom middle ear fluid was sampled to evaluate the etiology of the infection and the potential middle ear predilection of SARS-CoV-2 is described. This study has implications for the clinical management of patients with both known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with ear disease. While middle ear suctioning may not be aerosol-generating, the risk of coughing or prolonged close contact requires heightened precautions during otologic procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.","Mohan, Suresh; Workman, Alan; Barshak, Miriam; Welling, D Bradley; Abdul-Aziz, Dunia",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,36

The field of immunometabolism implies a bidirectional link between the immune system and metabolism, in which inflammation plays an essential role in the promotion of metabolic abnormalities (e.g., obesity and T2DM), and metabolic factors, in turn, regulate immune cell functions. Obesity as the main inducer of a systemic low-level inflammation is a main susceptibility factor for T2DM. Obesity-related immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress promote metabolic impairments in the insulin-sensitive tissues and finally, insulin resistance, organ failure, and premature aging occur. Hyperglycemia and the subsequent inflammation are the main causes of micro- and macroangiopathies in the circulatory system. They also promote the gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, and fatty liver disease. The impaired immune system together with metabolic imbalance also increases the susceptibility of patients to several pathogenic agents such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Thus, the need for a proper immunization protocol among such patients is granted. The focus of the current review is to explore metabolic and immunological abnormalities affecting several organs of T2DM patients and explain the mechanisms, whereby diabetic patients become more susceptible to infectious diseases.","Daryabor, Gholamreza; Atashzar, Mohamad Reza; Kabelitz, Dieter; Meri, Seppo; Kalantar, Kurosh",Front Immunol,,36

Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively the cellular and viral RBPs that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly remodels the cellular RNA-bound proteome, which includes wide-ranging effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs, and antiviral factors. Moreover, we apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral RNA, uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Among them are several components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we discover that available drugs targeting host RBPs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA inhibit infection.

333059,"Practice of Online Prevention and Control, Diagnosis and Treatment Model for COVID-19 in Large Com?prehensive Hospitals",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the start of the pandemic, millions of people have been infected, with thousands of deaths. Many foci worldwide have been identified in retirement nursing homes, with a high number of deaths. Our study aims were to evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the retirement nursing homes, the predictors to develop symptoms, and death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.15±10.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological syndrome were correlated with an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms. Fifty-six (21.2%) people with SARS-CoV-2 infection died; of these, 53 died in the first 30 days after the swab's positivity. Significant factors associated with 30-days mortality were male gender, hypokinetic disease, and the presence of fever and dyspnea. Patients' autonomy and early heparin treatment were related to lower mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced factors associated with infection's risk and death in a setting with high mortality such as retirement nursing homes, that should be carefully considered in the management of PLRNH.","De Vito, Andrea; Fiore, Vito; Princic, Elija; Geremia, Nicholas; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Muredda, Alberto Augusto; Maida, Ivana; Madeddu, Giordano; Babudieri, Sergio",PLoS One,,36

333707,Design of advanced siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19,2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors among human worldwide. Angiogenesis and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment are closely associated with CRC development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms revealing CRC progression are still not fully understood. 5'-Nucleotidase domain containing 2 (NT5DC2), a member of the NT5DC family, modulates various cellular events to mediate tumor growth, and thus serves as a disgnostic biomarker. Here, we explored the potential of NT5DC2 on tumor progression in CRC. We first found that NT5DC2 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. CRC patients with higher NT5DC2 expression showed poor overall survival. Furthermore, CRC cell lines stably transfected with shNT5DC2 lentivirus plasmids exhibited markedly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the negative control group. Hypoxia inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression levels were remarkably reduced in CRC cells with NT5DC2 deletion, along with evidently reduced tube formation in the HUVECs cultured in the collected conditional medium. The expression levels of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 were found to be greatly down-regulated in CRC cells transfected with shNT5DC2. Moreover, NT5DC2 knockdown markedly suppressed the activation of protein kinase-B/nuclear transcription factor &#954;B (AKT/NF-&#954;B) signaling in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that NT5DC2 deletion obviously reduced the TAM recruitments through suppressing CCL2/CCR2 and AKT/NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Intriguingly, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF reduction was necessary for shNT5DC2-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and TAM recruitment. In vivo studies also confirmed that NT5DC2 knockdown effectively reduced the tumor growth and VEGF expression in a xonegraft mouse model with CRC. Lung metastasis of CRC cells was also hindered by NT5DC2 deletion in vivo. Collectively, our results indicated a previously unrecognized NT5DC2/VEGF/CCL2 axis involved in CRC development and metastasis.","Zhu, Zhenyu; Hou, Qingsheng; Guo, Hongliang",Exp Cell Res,,36

Conversely, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be blunted by certain forms of immunosuppression, which could be protective. Indeed, there are data from animal models demonstrating that complement may be a part of the pathophysiology of coronavirus infections. There is also evidence from an autopsy series demonstrating complement deposition in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. This raises the question of whether patients on anti-complement therapy could be protected from COVID-19. CASE REPORT Case 1 is a 39-year-old woman with an approximately 20-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), who had recently been switched from treatment with eculizumab to ravulizumab prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 2 is a 54-year-old woman with a cadaveric renal transplant for lupus nephritis, complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy, who was maintained on eculizumab, which she started several months before she developed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 3 is a 60-year-old woman with a 14-year history of PNH, who had been treated with eculizumab since 2012, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of her scheduled infusion. All 3 patients had a relatively mild course of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS We see no evidence of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in these patients on anti-complement therapy, which might actually have accounted for the mild course of infection. The effect of anti-complement therapy on COVID-19 disease needs to be determined in clinical trials.","Araten, David J; Belmont, H Michael; Schaefer-Cutillo, Julia; Iyengar, Arjun; Mattoo, Aprajita; Reddy, Ramachandra",Am J Case Rep,,36

336511,Lymphadenopathy after BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine: Preliminary Ultrasound Findings,2021,"In this work we present a three-stage Machine Learning strategy to country-level risk classification based on countries that are reporting COVID-19 information. A K% binning discretisation (K = 25) is used to create four risk groups of countries based on the risk of transmission (coronavirus cases per million population), risk of mortality (coronavirus deaths per million population), and risk of inability to test (coronavirus tests per million population). The four risk groups produced by K% binning are labelled as 'low', 'medium-low', 'medium-high', and 'high'. Coronavirus-related data are then removed and the attributes for prediction of the three types of risk are given as the geopolitical and demographic data describing each country. Thus, the calculation of class label is based on coronavirus data but the input attributes are country-level information regardless of coronavirus data. The three four-class classification problems are then explored and benchmarked through leave-one-country-out cross validation to find the strongest model, producing a Stack of Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree algorithms for risk of transmission, a Stack of Support Vector Machine and Extra Trees for risk of mortality, and a Gradient Boosting algorithm for the risk of inability to test. It is noted that high risk for inability to test is often coupled with low risks for transmission and mortality, therefore the risk of inability to test should be interpreted first, before consideration is given to the predicted transmission and mortality risks. Finally, the approach is applied to more recent risk levels to data from September 2020 and weaker results are noted due to the growth of international collaboration detracting useful knowledge from country-level attributes which suggests that similar machine learning approaches are more useful prior to situations later unfolding.","Bird, Jordan J; Barnes, Chloe M; Premebida, Cristiano; Ekárt, Anikó; Faria, Diego R",PLoS One,,36

336571,Biological fluid dynamics of airborne COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: The government is the main body in charge of controlling epidemics; hence, expectations from the intention and capacities of the government would affect the flexibility and behaviors of citizens. Given the severity of COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for cooperation of people in the prevention and combat processes, understanding the public perspectives would be crucial and instructive. This study aimed to explore such perspectives towards the current pandemic among the Iranian. Indeed, we sought to provide a favorable platform for effective policies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic through recognizing public expectations. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used an open-ended online questionnaire to investigate the common perspectives of the Iranian towards the response of government to COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were selected using snowball and convenient sampling techniques across the country. The collected data were analyzed and described using a thematic analysis. RESULTS: In general, 2547 participants agreed to participate in this study and completed the online questionnaire. According to the findings, the Iranian exhibited several expectations regarding the response of the government to COVID-19 pandemic. Three main themes were extracted based on these expectations: (1) health-related expectations, (2) policy-related expectations, and (3) Information-related expectations. In this study, a majority of participants highlighted the need to consider and follow-up the patients and their families, providing the financial and hygiene support during the pandemic, applying strict restrictions, and using close monitoring and controlling procedures. Furthermore, they mentioned that authorities and news agencies should observe the principals honesty and transparency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that people expect the government and other responsible institutions to minimize the burden of this pandemic through adopting effective policies. Also, they could help policy-makers become aware of the expectations of people and develop better strategies.","Zarei, Leila; Shahabi, Saeed; Sadati, Ahmad Kalateh; Tabrizi, Reza; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Public Health,,36

The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio of classical CD14++monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1β+monocytes in the ERS. CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naïve B cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wen, Wen; Su, Wenru; Tang, Hao; Le, Wenqing; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Zheng, Yingfeng; Liu, Xiuxing; Xie, Lihui; Li, Jianmin; Ye, Jinguo; Dong, Liwei; Cui, Xiuliang; Miao, Yushan; Wang, Depeng; Dong, Jiantao; Xiao, Chuanle; Chen, Wei; Wang, Hongyang",Cell Discov.,,36

Chart review was performed for outcomes of interest including complication rates, readmission rates, emergency department visits, and inpatient narcotic usage. During post-procedure follow-up, patients completed an optional survey to measure self-reported post-procedural pain scores and satisfaction with pain regimen, length of hospital stay, and overall satisfaction. Results: Of 49 UAEs performed during the study period, 29% (n = 14) of patients were discharged home the same day and 71% (n = 35) were admitted for an overnight stay. When comparing the same-day discharge to overnight stay groups, no significant difference was found in complication rates (7% vs 26%, P = 0.24), emergency department visits (0% vs 14%, P = 0.30), re-hospitalization (0% vs 6%, P = 1), or opioid use (mean of 17 vs 26 morphine equivalents, P = 0.85). The survey received 18 responses, of which 33% (n = 6) were discharged home the same day and 67% (n = 12) were admitted overnight. When comparing the same-day discharge to overnight stay groups, no significant difference was found between self-reported pain the night of the procedure (on a scale from 0 to 10, mean 7 vs 5.5, P = 0.31), self-reported pain the week after the procedure (mean 4.9 vs 3.2, P = 0.23), satisfaction with the pain regimen (P = 0.7), satisfaction with the outpatient pain regimen (P = 0.28), satisfaction with length of hospital stay (P = 0.17), and overall satisfaction (P = 0.89). Conclusions: Same-day discharge after UAE when compared to overnight stay was found to have no significant difference in rates of readmission, emergency room visits, narcotic usage, patient-reported post-procedural pain, satisfaction with inpatient and outpatient pain regimen, satisfaction with length of hospital stay, and overall patient satisfaction. Same-day discharge is a safe and feasible option for patients undergoing UAE which may provide improved cost-effectiveness and resource utilization benefits for both the patient and the healthcare system. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, prioritization of resource allocation without compromise of patient safety will be of utmost importance.","Wang, M.; Rabei, R.; Yemane, H.; Kohi, M.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,36

338401,Flavonoids: A complementary approach to conventional therapy of COVID-19?,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, while hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell-death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Thachil, Jecko",J. thromb. haemost,,36

However, information on kidney damage in older patients with COVID-19 is limited. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and associated with poor prognosis. We sought to explore the association between AKI and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68-77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; pâ <â .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that increasing odds of in-hospital mortality are associated with higher interleukin-6 on admission, myocardial injury, and AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon complication in older patients with COVID-19 but is associated with a high risk of death. Physicians should be aware of the risk of AKI in older patients with COVID-19.","Yan, Qi; Zuo, Peiyuan; Cheng, Ling; Li, Yuanyuan; Song, Kaixin; Chen, Yuting; Dai, Yue; Yang, Yi; Zhou, Lun; Yu, Weiwei; Li, Yongsheng; Xie, Min; Zhang, Cuntai; Gao, Hongyu","J. gerontol.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The analysis used the data of 2994 contacts of 144 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The contacts were categorized according to the information source, type of contact, location, intensity of contact, and relationship with the index patient. RESULTS: The incidence of infection differed significantly according to contact type. Of the contacts, 186 (6.2%) developed symptoms, and 71 (2.4%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The main symptoms were cough and fever. Compared with those who had brief contact with the index case, those who had dined with the index case had 2.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; those who had shared transport with, had visited, or had contact with the index case in a medical institution had 3.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; and household contacts had 41.7 times higher risk of acquiring infection. Family members had 31.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection than healthcare providers or other patients exposed to an index case. CONCLUSIONS: The form and frequency of contact are the main factors affecting the risk of infection among contacts of individuals with COVID-19. Centralized isolation and observation of close contacts of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to population-based control measures, can reduce the risk of secondary infections and curb the spread of the infection.","Wu, Y; Song, S; Kao, Q; Kong, Q; Sun, Z; Wang, B",Public Health,,36

Empirical evidence has been provided regarding role of air pollution in accelerated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy as well as Wuhan. Lockdown-related reduction in PM2.5levels in ambient air may have contributed to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. High PM2.5levels in the past might have added to SARS-CoV-2 related mortality due to air pollution relate comorbidities.

From asymptomatic to symptomatic, the virus causes a wide spectrum of presentations. COVID-19 patients may present with oral manifestations. In Afghanistan, where COVID-19 has severely strained the health care system, much of the population lacks proper oral hygiene. This makes the oral cavity a perfect site for SARS-CoV-2 to manifest clinical signs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male was evaluated in the Dentistry Teaching Clinic of Kabul University of Medical Sciences for a painful erosive lesion on dorsal surface of his tongue. He also complained of fever, cough, and taste alteration. He was referred to Afghan Japan Hospital for COVID-19 testing and tested positive. He was followed on for the treatment of SARS-CoV2. After 2 weeks, the patient tested negative and returned to the dentistry clinic for follow-up. Although there were no other signs of COVID-19, the painful erosive lesion on his tongue persisted. Oral evaluation were performed and the patient was advised to practice good hygiene. After 10 days, we observed an asymptomatic geographic tongue without fever and myalgias and the lesion of dorsal surface of tongue improved from severe condition to moderate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for symptoms and physical findings in the oral mucosa To prevent such an outcome, awareness programs need to be implemented for the diagnosis and management of clinical symptoms among patients.","Nejabi, Mohammad Bashir; Noor, Noor Ahmad Shah; Raufi, Nahid; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Ehsan, Ehsanullah; Shah, Jaffer; Shah, Asghar; Nemat, Arash",BMC Oral Health,,36

Physicians performing orbital procedures may be at increased risk of occupational exposure to the virus due to exposure to secretions. The goal of this study is to measure the droplet and aerosol production during repair of the inferior orbital rim and trial a smoke-evacuating electrocautery handpiece as a mitigation device. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The inferior rim of 6 cadaveric orbits was approached transconjunctivally using either standard or smoke-evacuator electrocautery and plated using a high-speed drill. Following fluorescein inoculation, droplet generation was measured by counting under ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light against a blue background. Aerosol generation from 0.300-10.000 µm was measured using an optical particle sizer. Droplet and aerosol generation was compared against retraction of the orbital soft tissue as a negative control. RESULTS: No droplets were observed following the orbital approach using electrocautery. Visible droplets were observed after plating with a high-speed drill for 3 of 6 orbits. Total aerosol generation was significantly higher than negative control following the use of standard electrocautery. Use of smoke-evacuator electrocautery was associated with significantly lower aerosol generation in 2 of 3 size groups and in total. There was no significant increase in total aerosols associated with high-speed drilling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Droplet generation for orbital repair was present only following plating with high-speed drill. Aerosol generation during standard electrocautery was significantly reduced using a smoke-evacuating electrocautery handpiece. Aerosols were not significantly increased by high-speed drilling.","Ye, Michael J; Vadhul, Raghav B; Sharma, Dhruv; Campiti, Vincent J; Burgin, Sarah J; Illing, Elisa A; Ting, Jonathan Y; Park, Jae Hong; Koehler, Karl R; Lee, Hui Bae; Vernon, Dominic J; Johnson, Jeffrey D; Nesemeier, B Ryan; Shipchandler, Taha Z",Am J Otolaryngol,,36

The severity of the disease is variable ranging from mild form of pneumonia to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) requiring maximal level of organ support. Failure of the maximum support through mechanical ventilation can lead to the consideration of a higher level of organ support through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present a case of an 8 years old girl, who presented with severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia for which a venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) was initiated. This was followed by the patient developing cardiac arrest which was managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). The patient was also given thrombolytic therapy during the ECPR due to high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. VV-A ECMO was then continued and the patient was successfully weaned off both VA and VV ECMO and discharged home with full neurological recovery. This encouraging result will hopefully lead to more consideration of this lifesaving therapy for severe cardiac and respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 in paediatric patients.","Alfoudri, Huda; Shamsah, Mohammad; Yousuf, Beena; AlQuraini, Nasayem",ASAIO. j,,36

In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether muscle strength or muscle mass are predictive of hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. Methods We evaluated prospectively 196 patients at hospital admission for muscle mass and strength. Ten patients did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and were excluded from the analyses. Results The sample comprised patients of both sexes (50% male) with a mean age (SD) of 59 (±15) years, body mass index of 29.5 (±6.9) kg/m2. The prevalence of current smoking patients was 24.7%, and more prevalent coexisting conditions were hypertension (67.7%), obesity (40.9%), and type 2 diabetes (36.0%). Mean (SD) LOS was 8.6 days (7.7);17.0% of the patients required intensive care;3.8% used invasive mechanical ventilation;and 6.6% died during the hospitalization period. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for LOS was greatest for handgrip strength comparing the strongest versus other patients (1.47 [95% CI: 1.07?2.03;P = 0.019]). Evidence of an association between increased handgrip strength and shorter hospital stay was also identified when handgrip strength was standardized according to the sex-specific mean and standard deviation (1.23 [95% CI: 1.06?1.43;P = 0.007]). Mean LOS was shorter for the strongest patients (7.5 ± 6.1 days) versus others (9.2 ± 8.4 days). Evidence of associations were also present for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. The crude HR identified shorter hospital stay for patients with greater sex-specific standardized values (1.20 [95% CI: 1.03?1.39;P = 0.016]). Evidence was also obtained associating longer hospital stays for patients with the lowest values for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (0.63 [95% CI: 0.46?0.88;P = 0.006). Mean LOS for the patients with the lowest muscle cross-sectional area was longer (10.8 ± 8.8 days) versus others (7.7 ± 7.2 days). The magnitude of associations for handgrip strength and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area remained consistent and statistically significant after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusions Muscle strength and mass assessed upon hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, which stresses the value of muscle health in prognosis of this disease.","Gil, Saulo Jacob Filho Wilson Shinjo Samuel Katsuyuki Ferriolli Eduardo Busse Alexandre Leopold Avelino-Silva Thiago Junqueira Longobardi Igor de Oliveira Júnior Gersiel Nascimento Swinton Paul Gualano Bruno Roschel Hamilton The Hcfmusp Covid-Study Group","Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle",,36

METHODS: We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 1 February and 29 February 2020. Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG. IgM antibody appeared within a week post-disease onset, lasted for 1 month, and gradually decreased, whereas IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection and lasted for a longer time. However, no significant difference in levels of IgM and IgG antibodies between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and use systems that effectively manage the demand for services. METHODS: This was a cohort study using electronic health records at a health care system in northeast Ohio that examined the effectiveness of the first 5 weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline including social care referrals for patients required to self-isolate. We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. PARTICIPANTS: In 5 weeks, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers). Of these, 4213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). Mean age of callers was 42 years; 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid/uninsured. RESULTS: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 patients (7%) had a subsequent emergency department visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported, with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency department use (odds ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-16.39, P = .014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Patients with social needs and interest in receiving help were offered services to meet their needs including food deliveries (n = 92), behavioral health telephone visits (n = 49), and faith-based comfort calls from pastoral care personnel (n = 37). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of clinical and social needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","Margolius, David; Hennekes, Mary; Yao, Jimmy; Einstadter, Douglas; Gunzler, Douglas; Chehade, Nabil; Sehgal, Ashwini R; Tarabichi, Yasir; Perzynski, Adam T",J Am Board Fam Med,,36

The framework can explicitly separate potential lesions from original images, with the help of a generative adversarial network and a lesion-specific decoder. Experiments on two COVID-19 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its superior performance to several existing methods.","Yang, Yang; Chen, Jiancong; Wang, Ruixuan; Ma, Ting; Wang, Lingwei; Chen, Jie; Zheng, Wei-Shi; Zhang, Tong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00780v1.pdf,36

Thus, regulating the number of persons in a space is one means to limit social contact and ensure physical distancing among people. In addition to the privacy concerns of individuals' locations, the lack of elevation information can result in false positive cases for people who are horizontally close but vertically apart beyond the social distance. Therefore, we develop a normative model of the statistical distribution of physical distances to estimate the number of persons not social distancing in a three-dimensional complex built space from the current number of persons in the space (i.e. population density) present on an hourly basis. We conduct an empirical case study in the districts around the central stations of 13 of Japan's prefectures. To determine the number of people not social distancing in these districts, the proposed model uses open data such as the number of persons before the national emergency declaration, the ratio of the number of persons after the declaration to that before, and the floor area ratio specified by land use regulations in these districts.","Usui, H.; Asami, Y.; Yamada, I.",International Journal of Geographical Information Science,,36

METHODS: Patients with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 between January 01 and February 18, 2020, were included in this study. Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range 0-20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 ± 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24-80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011). CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010). However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P > 0.0125). No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages. However, larger cohort studies are necessary.","Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Jue; Chen, Hui; Chen, Luyan; Chen, Qiuying; Li, Minmin; Chen, Zhuozhi; You, Jingjing; Yang, Ke; Zhang, Shuixing",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,,36

351374,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on registered interventional clinical trials,2021,"Since the first appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier this year, clinicians and researchers alike have been faced with dynamic, daily challenges of recognizing, understanding, and treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient's existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients.

A reply to: ""Other excipients than PEG might cause serious hypersensitivity reactions in COVID-19 vaccines""",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Medical and other cannabis use by cancer patients continues to increase. Reasons for use include management of psychosocial stressors, physical and psychological symptoms. We explored the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on on patients' cannabis use, hypothesizing that users would be increasing their use due to heightened stress and increased uncertainty. METHODS: Participants were part of an anonymous online survey of cannabis use in cancer. Items specific to COVID-19 were administered between April and June 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of respondents (n = 26) confirmed they used cannabis during COVID-19. The top 5 reasons for use were sleep, anxiety, nausea, pain, and appetite. Ninety-two percent denied they were using cannabis for new or different symptoms. Eighty-one percent were using about the same amount as before, 11.5% were using less, and 8% more. Only 12% reported that product cost affected their use and that they had changed the way in which they used cannabis. Eight percent were stockpiling product so that they did not run out during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of those reporting a change in cannabis use were modest. Increased use may reflect efforts to relieve stress. Decreased use may reflect barriers to securing unregulated products and perceived vulnerability to the effects of infection on the respiratory system. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor its effects on cancer patients as it relates to psychosocial stressors, psychological symptoms, and cannabis use.","Donovan, Kristine A; Portman, Diane G",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,36

The findings of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) traces in waste water and the practice of disinfecting outdoor spaces in several cities in the world, which can result into the entry of disinfectants and their by-products into storm drainage systems and their subsequent discharge into rivers and coastal waters, raise the issue of environmental, ecological and public health effects. The aims of the current paper are to investigate the potential of water and waste water to operate as transmission routes for Sars-CoV-2 and the risks of this to public health and the geoenvironment. Additionally, several developing countries are characterised by low water-related disaster resilience and low household water security, with measures for protection of water resources and technologies for clean water and sanitation being substandard or not in place. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic in such cases, practical recommendations are provided herein.

359652,Interpretation of pooled sample testing of COVID-19 for efficient use of resources,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are considered the most effective protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human Challenge Studies can help to shorten the development process of vaccines. The reviewers' opinions from research ethics committees (REC) play an essential gate-keeping role in determining whether a clinical trial can be conducted or not. METHODS: A convergent mixed-methods study was conducted in a leading general hospital in China. A total of 58 REC members from the institution were invited to participate in an online questionnaire survey. According to the result of the quantitative survey, 15 of these REC members were purposefully selected to participate in qualitative interviews further. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses were synthesized to deeply illustrate the attitudes, views, and suggestions of REC members on human challenge studies to develop COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: The response rate of the online questionnaire was 62% (36/58), and 15 of the respondents were interviewed. All participants deemed that the human challenge study should provide compensation to its participants and that sufficiently informed consent is necessary. The human challenge study was disagreed with by 38.9% of participants. The key points of concern raised were representativeness and fairness of participant selection, benefit, and risk, vulnerable groups, compensation to participants, informed consent, and general view on human challenge studies. CONCLUSIONS: Human challenge studies helped accelerate the development of vaccines for disease control to a certain extent, but the bottom line of medical ethics should not have been broken. At any time, the rights and interests of research participants should come first.","Pan, Zihan; Chu, Hongling; Zhang, Yu; Hong, Xue; Liang, Lijun; Zhao, Wenzhi; Chen, Yahong; Song, Chunli",Ann Palliat Med,,36

However, many hospitals in low- and middle-income countries lack reliable oxygen access-a deficiency highlighted and exacerbated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Oxygen access can be challenged by equipment that is low quality and poorly maintained, lack of clinical and technical training and protocols, and deficiencies in local infrastructure and policy environment. We share learnings from 2 decades of oxygen systems work with hospitals in Africa and the Asia-Pacific regions, highlighting practical actions that hospitals can take to immediately expand oxygen access. These include strategies to: (1) improve pulse oximetry and oxygen use, (2) support biomedical engineers to optimize existing oxygen supplies, and (3) expand on existing oxygen systems with robust equipment and smart design. We make all our resources freely available for use and local adaptation.","Graham, Hamish R; Bagayana, Sheillah M; Bakare, Ayobami A; Olayo, Bernard O; Peterson, Stefan S; Duke, Trevor; Falade, Adegoke G",Glob Health Sci Pract,,36

361344,Optimizing Radiology Reading Room Design: The Eudaimonia Radiology Machine,2020,"Biologics are complex pharmaceuticals that include formulated proteins, plasma products, vaccines, cell and gene therapy products, and biological tissues. These products are fragile and typically require cold chain for their delivery and storage. Delivering biologics, while maintaining the cold chain, whether standard (2°C to 8°C) or deepfreeze (as cold as -70°C), requires extensive infrastructure that is expensive to build and maintain. This poses a huge challenge to equitable healthcare delivery, especially during a global pandemic. Even when the infrastructure is in place, breaches of the cold chain are common. Such breaches may damage the product, making therapeutics and vaccines ineffective or even harmful. Rather than strengthening the cold chain through building more infrastructure and imposing more stringent guidelines, we suggest that money and effort are best spent on making the cold chain unnecessary for biologics delivery and storage. To meet this grand challenge in pharmaceutical research, we highlight areas where innovations are needed in the design, formulation and biomanufacturing of biologics, including point-of-care manufacturing and inspection. These technological innovations would rely on fundamental advances in our understanding of biomolecules and cells.","Yu, Yihua Bruce; Briggs, Katharine T; Taraban, Marc B; Brinson, Robert G; Marino, John P",Pharm Res,,36
361621,Gut-lung axis and dysbiosis in COVID-19,2020,"A possible association could exist between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) infection. Indeed, patients with T2DM show high prevalence, severity of disease and mortality during Covid-19 infection. However, the rates of severe disease are significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared with non-diabetes (34.6% vs. 14.2%; p < 0.001). Similarly, T2DM patients have higher rates of need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU, 37.0% vs. 26.7%; p = 0.028). Thus, about the pneumonia of Covid-19, we might speculate that the complicated alveolar-capillary network of lungs could be targeted by T2DM micro-vascular damage. Therefore, T2DM patients frequently report respiratory symptoms and are at increased risk of several pulmonary diseases. In addition, pro-inflammatory pathways as that involving interleukin 6 (IL-6), could be a severity predictor of lung diseases. Therefore, it looks intuitive to speculate that this condition could explain the growing trend of cases, hospitalization and mortality for patients with T2DM during Covid-19 infection. To date, an ongoing experimental therapy with monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor in Italy seems to have beneficial effects on severe lung disease and prognosis in patients with Covid-19 infection. Therefore, should patients with T2DM be treated with more attention to glycemic control and monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor during the Covid-19 infection?","Sardu, Celestino; Gargiulo, Giuseppe; Esposito, Giovanni; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Marfella, Raffaele",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,36

However, the vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: This is a systematic review of published studies concerning pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and their neonates. SEARCH STRATEGY: We carried out a systematic search in multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 database using the following keywords: (Coronavirus) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (COVID-19) OR (COVID19) OR (COVID 19) OR (SARS-CoV2) OR (2019-nCoV)) and ((pregnancy) OR (pregnant) OR (vertical transmission) OR (neonate) OR (newborn) OR (placenta) OR (fetus) OR (Fetal)). The search took place in April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Original articles published in English were eligible if they included pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: The outcomes of interest consisted of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and also the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 37 articles involving 364 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 302 neonates were included. The vast majority of pregnant patients were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and only 45 cases were in the first or second trimester (12.4%). Most mothers described mild to moderate manifestations of COVID-19. Of 364 pregnant women, 25 were asymptomatic at the time of admission. The most common symptoms were fever (62.4%) and cough (45.3%). Two maternal deaths occurred. Some pregnant patients (12.1%) had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test but displayed clinical manifestations and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) scan related to COVID-19. Twenty-two (6.0%) pregnant patients developed severe pneumonia. Two maternal deaths occurred from severe pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction. Studies included a total of 302 neonates from mothers with COVID-19. Of the studies that provided data on the timing of birth, there were 65 (23.6%) preterm neonates. One baby was born dead from a mother who also died from COVID-19. Of the babies born alive from mothers with COVID-19, five newborns faced critical conditions, and two later died. A total of 219 neonates underwent nasopharyngeal specimen collection for SARS-CoV-2, of which 11 tested positive (5%). Seventeen studies examined samples of the placenta, breast milk, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, and all tested negative except one amniotic fluid sample. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of published studies confirm that the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women resembles that of other populations. However, there is not sufficient evidence to establish an idea that COVID-19 would not complicate pregnancy.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Arch Gynecol Obstet,,36

362779,Approaches for Optimal Use of Different COVID-19 Vaccines: Issues of Viral Variants and Vaccine Efficacy,2021,"BackgroundEarly in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many national public health authorities implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate disease outbreaks. Panama established mandatory mask use two months after its first documented case. Initial compliance was high, but diverse masks were used in public areas. We studied behavioral dynamics of mask use through the first two COVID waves in Panama, to improve implementation of effective, low-cost public health containment measures, when populations are exposed to novel air-borne pathogens. MethodsMask use behavior was recorded from pedestrians in four Panamanian populations (August to December 2020). We recorded facial coverings; and if used, the type of mask, and gender and estimated age of the wearer. FindingsPeople were highly compliant (> 95%) with mask mandates, and demonstrated important population-level behaviours: 1) decreasing use of cloth masks over time, and increasing use of surgical masks; 2) mask use was 3-fold lower in sub-urban neighborhoods than other public areas; and 3) young people were least likely to wear masks. InterpretationResults help focus highly-effective, low-cost, public health interventions for managing and controlling a pandemic. Considerations of behavioural preferences for different masks, relative to pricing and availability, are essential for optimizing public health policies. Policies to increase availability of effective masks, and behavioral nudges to increase acceptance, and to facilitate mask usage, during the on-going SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, are key tools, especially for nations lagging in access to expensive vaccines and pharmacological approaches.

363646,Current updates on COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"The dynamics that lead to the spread of an infectious disease through a population can be characterized as a complex system. One way to model such a system, in order to improve preparedness, and learn more about how an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, might spread through a population, is agent-based epidemiological modelling. When a pandemic is caused by an emerging disease, it takes time to develop a completely new model that captures the complexity of the system. In this paper, we discuss adapting an existing agent-based model for the spread of measles in Ireland to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The model already captures the population structure and commuting patterns of the Irish population, and therefore, once adapted to COVID-19, it can provide important insight on the pandemic, specifically in Ireland. We first investigate the different disease parameters that need to be adjusted to simulate the spread of COVID-19 instead of measles and then run a set of experiments initially comparing the model output for our original measles model with that from the adjusted COVID-19 model. We then report on experiments on how the different values of the basic reproductive number, R0, influence the simulated outbreaks, and find that our model behaves as expected: the higher the R0, the more agents are infected. Then, we demonstrate how different intervention strategies, such as vaccinations and school closures, influence the spread of measles and COVID-19 and how we can simulate real pandemic timings and interventions in our model. We show that with the same society, environment and transportation components among the different disease components lead to very different results for the two diseases, and that our COVID-19 model, when run for Leitrim County, Ireland, predicts a similar outbreak length to a real outbreak in Leitrim County, Ireland, but the model results in a higher number of infected agents compared to the real outbreak. This difference in cases is most likely due to identifying all cases of COVID-19 in the model opposed to only those tested. Once an agent-based model is created to simulate a specific complex system or society, the disease component can be adapted to simulate different infectious disease outbreaks. This makes agent-based models a powerful tool that can be used to help understand the spread of new and emerging infectious diseases.","Hunter, Elizabeth Kelleher John D.",Systems,,36
363647,Current updates on COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"During the novel coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 early data suggested that men were slightly more likely to contract COVID-19 than women, less likely to seek medical attention for the disease, and far more likely to die as a result of COVID-19. While several studies have explored this gender gap, none have attempted to isolate the psychological processes underpinning this phenomenon. In this research note, I suggest that belief in masculine norms partly explains these differences. Using data from a large (n=100,689) survey of American adults conducted between March and June by the Democracy Fund + UCLA (Nationscape), I find that sexist beliefs, a component of masculine norms, are consistently the strongest predictor of coronavirus-related emotions, behaviors, policy attitudes, and ultimately contracting COVID-19.

363859,Surgery-related COVID-19: A note,2021,"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently requires an effective vaccine for prevention. In this study, 66 epitopes containing pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the IEDB database were compared with the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 66 potentially immune-related peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained. Based on the SNPs analysis of spike protein of 1218 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, 52 easily mutated sites were identified and used for vaccine epitope screening. The best vaccine candidate epitopes in the 66 peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were screened out through mutation and immunoinformatics analysis. The best candidate epitopes were connected by different linkers in silico to obtain vaccine candidate sequences. The results showed that 16 epitopes were relatively conservative, immunological, non-toxic and non-allergenic, could induce the secretion of cytokines and more likely to be exposed on the surface of spike protein. They were both B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes, which could recognize a certain number of HLA molecules and had high coverage rates in different populations. Moreover, epitopes 897-913 were predicted possible cross-immunoprotection for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The results of vaccine candidate sequences screening suggested that sequences (without linker, with linker GGGSGGG, EAAAK, GPGPG and KK, respectively) were the best. The proteins translated by these sequences were relatively stable, with high antigenic index and good biological activity. Our study provided vaccine candidate epitopes and sequences for the research of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This article is protected by copyright.

Emerging evidences indicate that MCM2-7 (MCMs) are highly expressed in tissues from various malignant tumors. However, little is known about the clinical values of MCMs in breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate expression patterns, potential functions, and prognostic values of MCMs in breast cancer, through ONCOMINE, bc-GenExMiner v4.1, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and GeneMANIA databases. RESULTS We found that mRNA levels of MCMs were significantly elevated in breast cancer, especially in fast-growing and spreading tumor subtypes. These over-expressed MCMs predicted worse prognosis for breast cancer patients with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Among these six factors, high expression of MCM2/4/5/7 significantly reduced the RFS for patients with Luminal-A or B breast cancer and elevated MCM6/7 indicated shorter RFS for patients with basal-like or HER2-positive breast cancer. We also found that genomic alteration of MCMs was frequently found in breast cancer and the most common alteration was mRNA upregulation and amplification. Furthermore, MCMs were highly correlated with CDC45, CDC7, TIMELESS, ORC6, MCM10, ORC5, ORC4 and ORC3, mainly functioning to control the DNA replication initiation and genome stability. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MCMs are attractive prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer. Our study also provides useful clinical information about the potential of MCMs as therapeutic targets.","Cheng, Lin; Tan, Zhangmin; Huang, Zenan; Pan, Yuhang; Zhang, Wenhui; Wang, Jiani",Med Sci Monit,,36

364982,Routes for COVID-19 importation in Brazil,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major global health concern. Joint efforts for effective surveillance of COVID-19 require immediate transmission of reliable data. In this regard, a standardized and interoperable reporting framework is essential in a consistent and timely manner. Thus, this research aimed at to determine data requirements towards interoperability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, a combination of literature study and expert consensus approach was used to design COVID-19 Minimum Data Set (MDS). A MDS checklist was extracted and validated. The definitive data elements of the MDS were determined by applying the Delphi technique. Then, the existing messaging and data standard templates (Health Level Seven-Clinical Document Architecture [HL7-CDA] and SNOMED-CT) were used to design the surveillance interoperable framework. RESULTS: The proposed MDS was divided into administrative and clinical sections with three and eight data classes and 29 and 40 data fields, respectively. Then, for each data field, structured data values along with SNOMED-CT codes were defined and structured according HL7-CDA standard. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The absence of effective and integrated system for COVID-19 surveillance can delay critical public health measures, leading to increased disease prevalence and mortality. The heterogeneity of reporting templates and lack of uniform data sets hamper the optimal information exchange among multiple systems. Thus, developing a unified and interoperable reporting framework is more effective to prompt reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shanbehzadeh, Mostafa; Kazemi-Arpanahi, Hadi; Mazhab-Jafari, Komeil; Haghiri, Hamideh",J Educ Health Promot,,36

365152,The Long Haul of COVID-19 Recovery: Immune Rejuvenation versus Immune Support,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is a newly emerged beta coronavirus and etiolating agent of COVID-19. Considering the unprecedented increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency internationally on 11th March 2020. However, existing drugs are insufficient in dealing with this contagious virus infection;therefore, a vaccine is exigent to curb this pandemic disease. In the present study, B- and T-cell immune epitopes were identified for RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) protein using immunoinformatic techniques, which is proved to be a rapid and efficient method to explore the candidate peptide vaccine. Subsequently, antigenicity and interactions with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles were estimated. Further, physicochemical properties, allergenicity, toxicity, and stability of RdRp protein were evaluated to demonstrate the specificity of the epitope candidates. Interestingly, we identified a total of 36 B-cell and 16 T-cell epitopes using epitopes predictive tools. Among the predicted epitopes, 26 B-cell and 9 T-cell epitopes showed non-allergenic, non-toxic, and highly antigenic properties. Altogether, our study revealed that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 (an epitope-based peptide fragment) can be a potentially good candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

365552,COVID-19 and the eye immunity: lesson learned from the past and possible new therapeutic insights,2020,"Research has shown that stress impacts on people's religious beliefs. However, several aspects of this effect remain poorly understood, for example regarding the role of prior religiosity and stress-induced anxiety. This paper explores these aspects in the context of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The latter has impacted dramatically on many people's well-being; hence it can be considered a highly stressful event. Through online questionnaires administered to UK (n = 140) and USA (n = 140) citizens professing either Christian faith or no religion, this paper examines the impact of the coronavirus crisis upon common people's religious beliefs. Anxiety about the coronavirus and prior religiosity showed an interaction effect upon change in religious beliefs (t(276) = 2.27, p = .024): for strong believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased strengthening of religious beliefs (r = .249), while for non-believers higher anxiety about coronavirus was associated with increased scepticism towards religious beliefs (r = - .157). These observations are consistent with the notion that stress-induced anxiety enhances support for an individual's existing ideology already embraced before a stressful event occurs. This study sheds light on the psychological and cultural implications of the coronavirus crisis, which represents one of the most serious health emergencies in recent times.","Rigoli, Francesco",J Relig Health,,36

The aim of this paper is to automatically detect COVID-19 pneumonia patients using digital x-ray images while maximizing the accuracy in detection using image pre-processing and deep-learning techniques. A public database was created by the authors using three public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 190 COVID-19, 1345 viral pneumonia, and 1341 normal chest x-ray images. An image augmented training set was created with 2500 images of each category for training and validating four different pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks were tested for the classification of two different schemes (normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia). The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision for both the schemes were 98.3%, 96.7%, 100%, 100% and 98.3%, 96.7%, 99%, 100%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosing cases with COVID-19. This would be highly useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.","Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

368916,Will curcumin nanosystems be the next promising antiviral alternatives in COVID-19 treatment trials?,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the world with extensive social and economic effects. This editorial focuses specifically on the implications of the pandemic for small-scale fishers, including marketing and processing aspects of the sector, and coastal fishing communities, drawing from news and reports from around the world. Negative consequences to date have included complete shut-downs of some fisheries, knock-on economic effects from market disruptions, increased health risks for fishers, processors and communities, additional implications for marginalized groups, exacerbated vulnerabilities to other social and environmental stressors, and increased Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. Though much of the news is dire, there have been some positive outcomes such as food sharing, the revival of local food networks, increases in local sales through direct marketing and deliveries, collective actions to safeguard rights, collaborations between communities and governments, and reduced fishing pressure in some places. While the crisis is still unfolding, there is an urgent need to coordinate, plan and implement effective short- and long-term responses. Thus, we urge governments, development organizations, NGOs, donors, the private sector, and researchers to rapidly mobilize in support of small-scale fishers, coastal fishing communities, and associated civil society organizations, and suggest actions that can be taken by each to help these groups respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bennett, Nathan J.; Finkbeiner, Elena M.; Ban, Natalie C.; Belhabib, Dyhia; Jupiter, Stacy D.; Kittinger, John N.; Mangubhai, Sangeeta; Scholtens, Joeri; Gill, David; Christie, Patrick",Coast.

As traditional caregiving models ceased to function in the new setup, relatives of older adults turned to strangers and volunteers in an effort to provide urgent care to their older family members. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pan-India group of volunteers was formed during the lockdown on a popular social media website to connect people of all ages in need of help with those able to offer assistance. A sample of 242 messages pertaining to older adults was extracted for quantitative content analysis. RESULTS: All but two requests were placed by adult relatives of older adults. Requests covered a number of needs, some of which were directly tied to the pandemic and lockdown, while others were general in nature but were greatly exacerbated by recent events. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The use of social media to encourage acts of kindness at a time of crisis was an innovative attempt to meet the immediate needs of older adults. The lockdown, however, exposed the lack of dedicated supports and services for older adults in India.","Roy, Senjooti; Ayalon, Liat",,,36

People with autism may be vulnerable in research, but are also vulnerable to unjust exclusion from participation. Addressing the needs of participants with autism can facilitate inclusion and honor the bioethics principle of respect for persons while accounting for risk and vulnerability. Drawing from a review of the literature and informed by a moral deliberation process involving a task force of stakeholders (including autistic people and parents of autistic people), we use the model of person-oriented research ethics to identify several practical strategies researchers can use to address these needs and foster inclusion. Strategies include using multiple means of communication, addressing the sensory environment, preparing participants in advance, and accounting for social context. These practical strategies are not just methodological or design choices; they are inherently related to ethical issues. Method and design choices fulfill ethical aspirations by facilitating inclusion, reducing discomfort, and focusing on individuals.","Cascio, M Ariel; Weiss, Jonathan A; Racine, Eric",Ethics Hum Res,,36

MATERIALS AND METHODS: General dentists and dental specialists working in public and private dental practices, hospitals, and academic institutions participated in this cross-sectional study. A pilot-tested questionnaire was sent to dental professionals through an online link in Pakistan and data collection was completed in April-May 2020. The knowledge score was calculated from 22 variables about the COVID-19. RESULTS: The study included data of 343 dental professionals with 47.2% of males and 52.8% of females. The mean knowledge score was 16.78 ± 2.25, and it significantly differed between general dentists (16.55 ± 2.36) and dental specialists (17.15 ± 2.04) (p = 0.020), and those with up to 10 years of experience (16.58 ± 2.28) and those with more than 10 years of experience (17.05 ± 2.2) (p = 0.026). Only 15.5% of the participants were comfortable in treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A workshop/seminar on the COVID-19 was attended by 23% of the participants. In multivariate analysis, being comfortable in treating patients (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% confidence interval = 1.63, 6.73) was associated with the attendance of workshop/seminar on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Dental professionals had adequate knowledge about COVID-19, but a few of them were comfortable in treating patients during the pandemic. A minority of dental professionals attended a workshop/seminar on the COVID-19. Continuous education activities should be provided to dental professionals to enhance their role in the prevention of COVID-19 spread and promotion of oral health.","Almas, Khalid; Khan, Abdul Samad; Tabassum, Afsheen; Nazir, Muhammad Ashraf; Afaq, Ashar; Majeed, Abdul",European journal of dentistry,,36

In this report, we show the strategies adopted to face the emergency at Centro Cardiologico Monzino, a mono-specialist cardiology hospital sited in the region of Italy most affected by the pandemic, and specifically we describe how we have progressively modified in a few weeks the organization of our Heart Failure Unit in order to cope with the new COVID-19 outbreak. In fact, on the background of the pandemic, cardiovascular diseases still occur frequently in the general population, but we observed consistent reduction in hospital admissions for acute cardiovascular events and a dramatic increase of late presentation acute myocardial infarction. Despite a reduction of healthcare workers number, our ward has been rearranged in order to take care of both COVID-19 and cardiovascular patients.

375105,Neuropathogenesis in COVID-19,2020,"Background: People born between 1995 and 2012, referred to as Generation Z, grew up alongside significant technological advancements in communication. This cohort's oldest members are now entering the workforce. Literature review: Although the merits of generational research have been questioned, Generation Z's personal communication preferences and habits demonstrate unprecedented technological experiences and expectations in the workplace. Research questions: 1. What are Generation Z's current habits in using smart technology, social media, and voice communication for personal communication? 2. How does the current workplace communication environment appear through the lens of Generation Z? 3. Do the personal communication habits of Generation Z conflict with current workplaces? Methodology: The study reports on a 207-participant exploratory survey and 6 interviews with Generation Z members in January–March 2020. The survey included multiple choice and open-ended questions regarding respondents’ personal and workplace communication habits and expectations. The interviews allowed further investigation of survey responses. Results: Working Generation Z respondents hold unexpected attitudes and behaviors, including awareness of the negatives of technology use, differences in personal preferences and professional behaviors, self-regulation of technology use, and concern for boundaries between personal and work life. Conclusion: Generation Z's ability to adapt to current workplace norms may slow changes in workplace communication. Their awareness of disruptive communication habits could make positive changes to workplace communication in the future. Employers should resist negative generational stereotypes and develop new communication policies to reflect current and future-looking technology use. This study was completed prior to COVID-19 and does not include pandemic-related workplace technology changes.

375148,Endodiathermy assisted vitreous base and anterior hyaloid visualization during vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,2020,"Antiviral drug therapy against SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established and posing a serious global health issue. Remdesivir is the first antiviral compound approved by the US FDA for the SARS-CoV-2 treatment for emergency use, targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme. In this work, we have examined the action of remdesivir and other two ligands screened from the library of nucleotide analogues using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The MD simulations have been performed for all the ligand-bound RdRp complexes for the 30 ns time scale. This is one of the earlier reports to perform the MD simulations studies using the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp crystal structure (PDB ID 7BTF). The MD trajectories were analyzed and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed to calculate the binding free energy. The binding energy data reveal that compound-17 (-59.6 kcal/mol) binds more strongly as compared to compound-8 (-46.3 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-29.7 kcal/mol) with RdRp. The detailed analysis of trajectories shows that the remdesivir binds in the catalytic site and forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic residues from 0 to 0.46 ns. Compound-8 binds in the catalytic site but does not form direct hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues. Compound-17 showed the formation of hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues throughout the simulation process. The MD simulation results such as hydrogen bonding, the center of mass distance analysis, snapshots at a different time interval, and binding energy suggest that compound-17 binds strongly with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to develop as a new antiviral against COVID-19. Further, the frontier molecular orbital analysis and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) iso-surface analysis using DFT calculations shed light on the superior binding of compound-17 with RdRp compared to remdesivir and compound-8. The computed as well as the experimentally reported pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of compound-17 is encouraging and therefore can be one of the potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wakchaure, Padmaja D; Ghosh, Shibaji; Ganguly, Bishwajit",J Phys Chem B,,36

377132,P150. Development of a safe one stop and surgical pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic first peak,2021,"Background. Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Hu, Xingxing; Tan, Weijun; Mazzone, Peter; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Han, Xiao-Zhen; Huang, Pingyue; Hu, Weihua; Dweik, Raed; Cheng, Zhenshun",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,36
377852,Pooling Data From Individual Clinical Trials in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response characterization represents a crucial issue for defining the role of immune protection against COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess the SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and in a group of unexposed subjects. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was quantified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 87 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (range 7-239 days after symptom onset) and 33 unexposed donors by ex vivo ELISpot assay. Follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was performed in ten subjects up to 12 months after symptom onset. The role of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was characterized in a group of COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies were determined in serum samples. RESULTS: In 14/33 (42.4%) unexposed donors and 85/87 (97.7%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects a positive result for at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen was observed. A positive response was observed up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection (median 246 days after symptom onset; range 118-362 days). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response seems to be mainly mediated by CD4 T cells. A weak positive correlation was observed between Spike-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody titre (p 0.0028; r2 = 0.2891) and positive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response was observed in 8/9 (88.9%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. DISCUSSION: Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in uninfected patients may be due to previous infections with other common coronaviruses. Our data suggest that long-term SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response might accompany a waning humoral response.","Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Bergami, Federica; Piralla, Antonio; Comolli, Giuditta; Bruno, Raffaele; Vecchia, Marco; Sambo, Margherita; Colaneri, Marta; Zuccaro, Valentina; Benazzo, Marco; Robotti, Carlo; Calastri, Anna; Maiorano, Eugenia; Ferrari, Alessandro; Cambiè, Giuseppe; Baldanti, Fausto",Clin. microbiol. infect,,36

However, it is unclear how a specific event fosters the rise of a particular type of nationalism, and how these different categories of nationalism relate to globalism. Given that, this study collected the most popular comments on 164 international COVID-19 events on Weibo to categorize different types of nationalism and measure the popularity index. The distribution of nationalism-categories across different topics was later estimated through semantic analysis, so as to explore how nationalism implies netizens' anti-globalization and pro-globalization sentiments. Specifically, the study categorized two different expressions of nationalism during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a counterattack posture to external threats that is reflected as the Suppression of Ambivalent Attitudes, or a comparative response to global competition that serves as a stimulate to the Feeling of National Superiority. While the first expression is aligned with anti-globalization feelings, the second nationalistic sentiment stems from a sense of national superiority, which does not pose a threat to globalization. Our research revealed that a political global crisis not only influences the rise of nationalism but also its evolution.","Wang, Zhenyu; Tao, Yuzhou",J Chin Polit Sci,,36

A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.","Violi, Francesco; Pastori, Daniele; Cangemi, Roberto; Pignatelli, Pasquale; Loffredo, Lorenzo",Thromb Haemost,,36

These sentences have been translated in 101 languages by professional translators through a carefully controlled process. The resulting dataset enables better assessment of model quality on the long tail of low-resource languages, including the evaluation of many-to-many multilingual translation systems, as all translations are multilingually aligned.

A general information questionnaire and a stress perception scale were used to investigate and analyze the influencing factors of perceived stress among participants. Perceived stress was at the intermediate level or above for 54.1% (133) of the sample. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that hospital department, living styles, physical conditions, and the proportion of negative (eg, increased deaths and infections) information received about the epidemic (eg, via media and/or face-to-face) influenced perceived stress. Thus, the overall level of perceived stress among clinical pediatric nurses was medium. Nursing managers should pay more attention to and conduct timely assessment interventions for staff to reduce stress levels and promote physical and mental health.","Yan, Mengwei; Xie, Anwei; Cheng, Fangfang; Zhou, Weifang; Tian, Jianmei; Xu, Yunqiu",Holist Nurs Pract,,36
378453,Determinants of Willingness for COVID-19 Vaccine: Implications for Enhancing the Proportion of Vaccination Among Indians,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A potential protection against COVID-19 by a high-quality dietary pattern is to be expected given the biological plausibility supporting the beneficial effects of an adequate dietary intake on the immune system. However, knowledge on the relationship between long-term maintained healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still sparse. We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9,677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5,194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5,194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (3 < MDS &#8804; 6) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34-0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS > 6) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS &#8804; 3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, better adherence to the Mediterranean diet may be associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. Our results are applicable only to persons who are not health professionals.","Perez-Araluce, R; Martinez-Gonzalez, M A; Fernández-Lázaro, C I; Bes-Rastrollo, M; Gea, A; Carlos, S",Clin. nutr.

There are some pieces of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genome could be re-detectable in recovered patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in the PubMed/Medline database to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 recurrence. The last update was for 20 November 2020. Among the 1178 initially found articles, 66 met the inclusion criteria and were considered. FINDINGS: In total, 1128 patients with at least one-time recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Recurrence rate has been reported between 2.3% and 21.4% in cohort studies, within a mean of 20 (ranged 1-98) days after discharge; younger patients are being affected more. Following the second course of disease, the disease severity decreased or remained unchanged in 97.3% while it increased in 2.6%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were positive in 11-95% and 58.8-100%, respectively. Based on the literature, three possibilities include reactivation of previous disease, reinfection with the same virus, and false negative, which have been discussed in details. CONCLUSION: There is a relatively notable risk of disease recurrence in previously recovered patients, even those who are immunised against the virus. More studies are required to clarify the underlying cause of this phenomenon.","Piri, Seyed Mohammad; Edalatfar, Maryam; Shool, Sina; Jalalian, Mohammad Naser; Tavakolpour, Soheil",Infect Dis (Lond),,36

Legal and socio-legal scholars in the decade and a half before the pandemic worked on locating global health law and articulating its underlying principles. Lawrence Gostin's 2014 monograph offers a synoptic view centred on international institutions (e.g. the World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, UN Human Rights Council) and problems (e.g. infectious-disease response, tobacco control), along with an elaboration of its normative basis in universal moral principle and international human rights law (Gostin, 2014). Struggles over access to essential medicines and intellectual property in the early 2000s are, for example, represented in terms of the right to health constraining international trade law. Andreas Fischer-Lescano and Guenther Teubner's 2004 reading is oriented more by social theory than by doctrinal or ethical frames (Fischer-Lescano and Teubner, 2004, pp. 1006, 1008). A functional health regime has 'differentiated out', they observe, and operates as a discrete communication system across borders, albeit one that is threatened by the preponderant economic system. On this model, the battle for access to medicines amounts to ensuring, via human rights guarantees, that the rationality of the health system is not replaced by that of its economic rival in legal and policy communications (Fischer-Lescano and Teubner, 2004, pp. 1030, 1046). &copy;2021 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS: Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases. CONCLUSION: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.","Zareie, Bushra; Roshani, Amin; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Rasouli, Mohammad Aziz; Moradi, Ghobad",Arch Iran Med,,36

Although computed tomography (CT) shows a high sensitivity for pneumonia in living persons, it is relatively unspecific for COVID-19 pneumonia clinically. Typical CT findings for viral pneumonia therefore require confirmation by PCR tests (polymerase chain reaction tests), even if lung infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) show characteristic patterns, most frequently ground glass opacities (GGO) and a combination of GGO and air space consolidations. In the consecutive autopsy series of SARS-CoV­2 deaths from Hamburg, Germany, the most frequent cause of death was and still is COVID-19 pneumonia. Typical findings were frequently found in the PMCT in SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths, which were taken into account when classifying the death as COVID-19.","Kniep, I; Heinemann, A; Edler, C; Sperhake, J P; Püschel, K; Ondruschka, B; Schröder, A S",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,36

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with cam-type FAI who underwent hip arthroscopy in our institute from January 2018 to June 2019. All hip arthroscopic procedures were performed by one experienced surgeon in the same manner, except the fashions of capsulotomy. Fifty six patients with mean age of 39.1 and mean body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 were categorized into two groups according to the fashions of capsulotomy. Twenty six cases with longitudinal outside-in capsulotomy were categorized into Group L, and 30 cases with transversal interportal capsulotomy were categorized into Group T as the control group. The demographic parameters were retrieved from medical documents and compared between the two groups. Surgical outcome including overall surgical time, traction time, complications, visual analogue score (VAS), and intraoperative radiation exposure were compared to investigate the security and feasibility. Radiographic assessment, and functional outcome were compared between the two groups to determine the clinical efficacy of the longitudinal capsulotomy. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the demography and duration of follow-up between the two groups. The overall surgical time demonstrated no significant difference between Group L and Group T (130.8 ± 16.6 min and 134.0 ± 14.7 min, P = 0.490). Significantly decreased traction time was found in Group L (43.2 ± 8.4 min and 62.2 ± 8.6 min, P < 0.001) compared to Group T. The Median of the fluoroscopic shot was 1 and 3 (P < 0.001). No major complications and reoperation were reported in both groups. The case of intraoperative iatrogenic injure was 0 (0%) and 6 (20%) in Group L and Group T respectively (P = 0.035), and the case of postoperative neurapraxia was 0 (0%) and 8 (26.6%) in Group L and Group T respectively (P = 0.017). The Median of postoperative VAS was 2 and 3 in Group L Group T (P = 0.002). The postoperative &#945; angle was 42.3° ± 3.4° and 44.4° ± 3.5° in group L and group T respectively (P = 0.001). The postoperative iHOT-12 score at final follow-up was 79.3 ± 6.7 and 77.0 ± 7.9 respectively (P = 0.141). CONCLUSION: Longitudinal outside-in capsulotomy with less radiation exposure, reduced traction time, and reduced complications could be a safe and feasible procedure in arthroscopic treatment for cam FAI. Its clinical efficacy was not worse compared with traditional interportal capsulotomy in short-term follow-up.","Yin, Qing-Feng; Wang, Long; Liang, Tao; Zhao, Heng; Wang, Xue-Song",Orthopaedic surgery (Online),,36

382771,A humanized mouse model of chronic COVID-19 to evaluate disease mechanisms and treatment options,2021,"Background: COVID-19 has caused a global public health emergency. Government mitigation strategies included a series of behavior-based prevention policies that had a likely impact on the spread of other contagious respiratory illnesses, such as seasonal influenza. Our aim was to explore how 2019-2020 influenza tracked onto COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation methods. Materials and Methods: We linked the WHO FluNet database and COVID-19 confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) for four countries across the northern (Canada, the United States) and southern hemispheres (Australia, Brazil) for the period 2016-2020. Graphical presentations of longitudinal data were provided. Results: There was a notable reduction in influenza cases for the 2019-2020 season. Northern hemisphere countries experienced a quicker ending to the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza cases (shortened by 4-7 weeks) and virtually no 2020 fall influenza season. Countries from the southern hemisphere experienced drastically low levels of seasonal influenza, with consistent trends that were approaching zero cases after the introduction of COVID-19 measures. Conclusions: It is likely that the COVID-19 mitigation measures played a notable role in the marked decrease in influenza, with little to no influenza activity in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In spite of this reduction in influenza cases, there was still community spread of COVID-19, highlighting the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza. These results, together with the higher mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza, highlight that COVID-19 is a far greater health threat than influenza.","Stojanovic, Jovana; Boucher, Vincent G; Boyle, Jacqueline; Enticott, Joanne; Lavoie, Kim L; Bacon, Simon L",Front Public Health,,36

In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, in the interviewed families, the simultaneous presence of adults and children at home has generally intensified. Families refer, on the whole, a positive and resilient behavior in the lockdown period, even if initial emotional problems are reported in one out of three children-adolescents. The ability to maintain a family organized structure seems to be partially compromised. Forced cohabitation leads to competition for the same resources of time and space and affects the entire family unit. The school institution emerges as a protective factor for children, young people and also for the well-being of families themselves.","Brunelli, Antonella; Silvestrini, Giulia; Palestini, Luigi; Vitali, Patrizia; Nanni, Rachele; Belluzzi, Antonio; Ciambra, Roberta; De Logu, Marcella; Degli Angeli, Mila; Dessì, Francesca Luisa; Donati, Daniela; Gaspari, Laura; Ghini, Teresa; Giovannini, Michela; Iaia, Maurizio; Mazzini, Franco; Mollace, Rocco; Nanni, Viridiana; Perra, Anna Pina; Poggioli, Barbara; Ponton, Ilaria; Russo, Giustina; Saletti, Annalena; Selli, Arrigo; Stazzoni, Antonella; Vignutelli, Lucia; Zamuner, Elena; Venturini, Lisa; Zamprogno, Enrico; Valletta, Enrico; Marchetti, Federico",Recenti Prog Med,,36

(Special Issue: The pharmacology of COVID-19.),2020,"Introduction: High levels of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial impairments are anticipated for those recovering from the COVID-19. In the UK, ~50% of survivors will require additional rehabilitation. Despite this, there is currently no evidence-based guideline available in England and Wales that addresses the identification, timing and nature of effective interventions to manage the morbidity associated following COVID-19. It is now timely to accelerate the development and evaluation of a rehabilitation service to support patients and healthcare services. Nuffield Health have responded by configuring a scalable rehabilitation pathway addressing the immediate requirements for those recovering from COVID-19 in the community. Methods and Analysis: This long-term evaluation will examine the effectiveness of a 12-week community rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 patients who have been discharged following in-patient treatment. Consisting of two distinct 6-week phases; Phase 1 is an entirely remote service, delivered via digital applications. Phase 2 sees the same patients transition into a gym-based setting for supervised group-based rehabilitation. Trained rehabilitation specialists will coach patients across areas such as goal setting, exercise prescription, symptom management and emotional well-being. Outcomes will be collected at 0, 6, and 12 weeks and at 6- and 12-months. Primary outcome measures will assess changes in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and COVID-19 symptoms using EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) and Dyspnea-12, respectively. Secondary outcome measures of the Duke Activity Status Questionnaire (DASI), 30 s sit to stand test, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) will allow for the evaluation of outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Discussion: This evaluation will investigate the immediate and long-term impact, as well as the cost effectiveness of a blended rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 survivors. This evaluation will provide a founding contribution to the literature, evaluating one of the first programmes of this type in the UK. The evaluation has international relevance, with the potential to show how a new model of service provision can support health services in the wake of COVID-19.

However, most monaural speech enhancement (SE) models introduce processing artifacts and thus degrade the performance of downstream tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper proposes a multi-task training framework to make the SE models unharmful to ASR. Because most ASR training samples do not have corresponding clean signal references, we alternately perform two model update steps called SE-step and ASR-step. The SE-step uses clean and noisy signal pairs and a signal-based loss function. The ASR-step applies a pre-trained ASR model to training signals enhanced with the SE model. A cross-entropy loss between the ASR output and reference transcriptions is calculated to update the SE model parameters. Experimental results with realistic large-scale settings using ASR models trained on 75,000-hour data show that the proposed framework improves the word error rate for the SE output by 11.82% with little compromise in the SE quality. Performance analysis is also carried out by changing the ASR model, the data used for the ASR-step, and the schedule of the two update steps.","Eskimez, Sefik Emre; Wang, Xiaofei; Tang, Min; Yang, Hemin; Zhu, Zirun; Chen, Zhuo; Wang, Huaming; Yoshioka, Takuya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02896v1.pdf,36

Moreover, we explore the idea that opinion-based news articles cannot be classified as real or fake due to their subjective nature and often sensationalised language, and propose a novel two-step classification pipeline to remove such articles from both model training and the final deployed inference system. Experiments over the ISOT and Combined Corpus datasets show that transformers achieve an increase in F1 scores of up to 4.9% for out of distribution generalisation compared to baseline approaches, with a further increase of 10.1% following the implementation of our two-step classification pipeline.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of high-flow nasal cannula for COVID-19 on population-level mortality and ventilator availability. METHODS: We constructed dynamical (deterministic) simulation models of high-flow nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation use for COVID-19 in the U.S. Model parameters were estimated through consensus based on published literature, local data, and experience. We had two outcomes: (1) cumulative number of deaths and (2) days without any available ventilators. We assessed the impact of various policies for use of high-flow nasal cannula (with or without ""early intubation"") versus a scenario where high-flow was unavailable. RESULTS: The policy associated with the fewest deaths and the least time without available ventilators combined the use of high-flow nasal cannula for patients not urgently needing ventilators with the use of early mechanical ventilation for these patients when at least 10% ventilator supply was not in use. At the national level, this strategy resulted in 10,000 - 40,000 fewer deaths than if high-flow nasal cannula were not available. Additionally, with moderate national ventilator capacity (30,000-45,000 ventilators), this strategy led to up to 25 (11.8%) fewer days without available ventilators. For a 250-bed hospital with 100 mechanical ventilators, the availability of 13, 20, or 33 high-flow nasal cannulas prevented 81, 102, and 130 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of high-flow nasal cannula coupled with early mechanical ventilation when supply is sufficient results in fewer deaths and greater ventilator availability.","Gershengorn, Hayley B; Hu, Yue; Chen, Jen-Ting; Hsieh, S Jean; Dong, Jing; Gong, Michelle Ng; Chan, Carri W",Ann.

In the summertime, however, the Japanese government has cautioned that some COVID-19 pandemic conditions may affect the risk to heatstroke. This study investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic setting affected heatstroke-related ambulance dispatches (HSAD). Daily HSAD data and relevant weather parameters from June to September from 2016 to 2020 of 47 prefectures in Japan were obtained from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) database. A binary variable representing COVID-19 impact was created, whereby years 2016 to 2019 were coded as 0, while 2020 as 1. We employed a two-stage analysis in elucidating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HSAD. Firstly, we regressed HSAD with the COVID-19 binary variable after adjusting for relevant covariates to obtain prefecture-specific effect estimates. Prefecture-specific estimates were subsequently pooled via random effects meta-analysis in generating the pooled estimate. Pooled Relative Risk (RR) of HSAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was 0.78 (95% Confidential Interval [CI], 0.75-0.82). We found an overall statistically significant decrease in HSAD risk during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Specifically, the decrease in the risk of HSAD may be linked to the COVID-19 precautionary measures such as stay-home request and availability of alternative consultation services, which may have decreased the direct exposure of the population to extreme heat.","Hatakeyama, Koya; Ota, Junko; Takahashi, Yoshiko; Kawamitsu, Saki; Seposo, Xerxes",Sci Total Environ,,36

Extensive studies suggested the role of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm in COVID-19 and reducing viral infection; however, the precise molecular mechanism is not clearly known. In this work, bioinformatics and systems biology approaches were used to understand SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine pathways and the potential mechanism of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm and enhancing antiviral response. Results: This study used transcriptome data and identified 108 differentially expressed host genes (DEHGs) in SARS-CoV-2 infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells compared to control. Then, the DEHGs was integrated with the human protein-protein interaction data to generate a SARS-CoV-2 induced host gene regulatory network (SiHgrn). Analysis of SiHgrn identified a sub-network ""Cluster 1"" with the highest MCODE score, 31 up-regulated genes, and predominantly associated immune and inflammatory response. Interestingly, the iRegulone tool identified that ""Cluster 1"" is under the regulation of transcription factors STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, POU2F2, and NFkB1, collectively referred to as ""host response signature network"". Functional enrichment analysis with NDEx revealed that the ""host response signature network"" is predominantly associated with critical pathways, including ""cytokines and inflammatory response"", ""non-genomic action of Vitamin D"", ""the human immune response to tuberculosis"", and ""lung fibrosis"". Finally, in-depth analysis and literature mining revealed that Vitamin D binds with its receptor and could work through two different pathways: (i) it inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through blocking the TNF induced NFkB1 signaling pathway; and (ii) it initiates the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) for antiviral defense program through activating the IFN-&#945; induced Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Conclusion: This comprehensive study identified the pathways associated with cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed underlying mechanism of Vitamin D could be promising in suppressing the cytokine storm and inducing a robust antiviral response in severe COVID-19 patients. The finding in this study urgently needs further experimental validations for the suitability of Vitamin D in combination with IFN-&#945; to control severe COVID-19.","Ahmed, Firoz",Front Immunol,,36
390923,Advantages of Using Lotteries to Select Participants for High-Demand Covid-19 Treatment Trials,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Conventional radiography using an anteroposterior view of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint is the gold standard for evaluating arthritic degeneration. OBJECTIVE: Based on a standardised AP view of the AC joint, the objective of this study was to determine whether this radiographic view is reliable and reproducible for evaluating the AC joint space. METHODS: A cadaver scapula-clavicle unit, free of osteoarthritis, was used for this study. The scapula was positioned in a stand; and then with fluoroscopy guidance, a strict AP view of the AC joint was taken. Starting from this ""0"" position, a radiograph was taken by varying the angle by 5°, 10°, and 15° in every plane in space. All radiographs were taken during a single session to ensure the distance between the X-ray tube and scapula did not change. The images were then exported to OsiriX for processing; the superior and inferior AC distance and the joint area were measured. RESULTS: There was no reproducibility in the AC joint measurements as a function of the incidence angle relative to a strict AP view. CONCLUSION: Conventional radiography using an AP view of the AC joint cannot be used to do a fine analysis of arthritic degeneration of this joint. It is likely that only CT scan or MRI is sufficient to analyse osteoarthritis in this joint.

391384,COVID-19: has EBM been replaced by hype-based medicine?,2020,"In contrast to the computational generation of conventional tautomers, the analogous operation that would produce ring-chain tautomers is rarely available in cheminformatics codes. This is partly due to the perceived unimportance of ring-chain tautomerism and partly because specialized algorithms are required to realize the non-local proton transfers that occur during ring-chain rearrangement. Nevertheless, for some types of organic compounds, including sugars, warfarin analogs, fluorescein dyes and some drug-like compounds, ring-chain tautomerism cannot be ignored. In this work, a novel ring-chain tautomer generation algorithm is presented. It differs from previously proposed solutions in that it does not rely on hard-coded patterns of proton migrations and bond rearrangements, and should therefore be more general and maintainable. We deploy this algorithm as part of a workflow which provides an automated solution for tautomer generation and scoring. The workflow identifies protonatable and deprotonatable sites in the molecule using a previously described approach based on rapid micro-pKa prediction. These data are used to distribute the active protons among the protonatable sites exhaustively, at which point alternate resonance structures are considered to obtain pairs of atoms with opposite formal charge. These pairs are connected with a single bond and a 3D undistorted geometry is generated. The scoring of the generated tautomers is performed with a subsequent density functional theory calculation employing an implicit solvent model. We demonstrate the performance of our workflow on several types of organic molecules known to exist in ring-chain tautomeric equilibria in solution.

Used for contact tracing, quarantine enforcement, travel permission, social distancing/movement monitoring, and symptom tracking, their rushed rollout has been justified by the argument that they are vital to suppressing the virus, and civil liberties have to be sacrificed for public health. I challenge these contentions, questioning the technical and practical efficacy of surveillance technologies, and examining their implications for civil liberties, governmentality, surveillance capitalism, and public health.","Kitchin, Rob",Space Polity,,36

392825,Management of anaphylaxis due to COVID-19 vaccines in the elderly,2021,"During the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, pharmacy services have had to adapt their service portfolio, and yet ensure efficient, equitable and quality pharmaceutical care. Given the limited scientific evidence available, most drugs have been used off-label or in the context of clinical trials, which should be the preferred option in order to create new evidence. Among kind different situations we have faced are the increase in workload, the expansion of coverage to new wards and ICUs and shortages, which have caused the use of alternative drugs and even other routes of administration. Given that covid-19 affects elderly population with greater severity and many of them are polymedicated, great effort have been focused on monitoring interactions, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (specially prolongation of the QT interval), monitoring correct concentrations of electrolytes, nutritional support, adaptation of chemotherapy treatment protocols and anticoagulant management, among others. The use of personal protective equipment added difficulty for nursing work and some measures had been taken to minimize the number of entries into the rooms. Eventually, team's split to guarantee care, the challenge of teleworking, remote validation, telemedicine and telepharmacy for communication between professionals and patients, as well as training in this pandemic situation have been a challenge for our profession. These difficulties have risen up new learning opportunities we hope will be useful to us in the event we have to face similar situations in the future.","Sevilla-Sánchez, Daniel; Tuset-Creus, Montse",Farm Hosp,,36

DESIGN: This is a retrospective review. SETTING: The setting is three freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals operating as one system. PARTICIPANTS: The participants are consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital without a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or screening duplex ultrasound prior to transfer. INTERVENTIONS: A duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed upon admission to inpatient rehabilitation hospital. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the percentage of admission patients with a lower limb deep venous thrombosis. Secondary factors included potential risk factors for a positive screen for deep venous thrombosis. RESULTS: A lower limb deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 22% (25/113) of the patients tested, with eight patients (7.1%) having a proximal deep venous thrombosis. Risk factors for screening positive for a deep venous thrombosis included being male, younger, and having been on a ventilator during the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of deep venous thrombosis observed in these patients suggests that the risk of venous thromboembolic disorders after severe COVID-19 illness is considerable and surveillance measures of such patients should be undertaken.","Kirshblum, Steven C; DeLauter, Gabrielle; Eren, Fatma; Pomeranz, Bruce; DeLuca, Robert; Hammerman, Samuel; Gans, Bruce M",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,36

We present a case of SARS-COV2 pneumonia with septic shock and multi-organ failure that demonstrated significant clinical improvement after therapeutic plasma exchange. A 65-year-old female with multiple comorbidities presented with progressive dyspnea and dry cough. She was found to be COVID-19 positive with pneumonia, and developed progressive hypoxemia and shock requiring vasopressors, cardioversion, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Given her worsening sepsis with multi-organ failure, she underwent therapeutic plasma exchange with rapid clinical improvement. Her case supports the theory that plasma exchange may help abate the “cytokine storm” induced endotheliopathy and microthrombosis associated with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to identify markers of this pathway and the potential role of plasma exchange in these critically ill patients.","Keith, Philip; Day, Matthew; Choe, Carol; Perkins, Linda; Moyer, Lou; Hays, Erin; French, Marshall; Hewitt, Kristi; Gravel, Gretchen; Guffey, Amanda; Scott, L Keith",SAGE Open Med.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECMO has been utilized in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia. Early case series with the use of ECMO in these patients reported high mortality exceeding 90%. METHODS: Using ICD-10 codes, data of patients with COVID-19 with ARDS, managed with ECMO between April and September 2020, were analyzed using the Vizient clinical database. Outcomes measured included in-hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, and direct cost. For comparative purposes, the outcome of a subset of COVID-19 patients aged between 18 and 64âyears and managed with versus without ECMO were examined. RESULTS: 1,182 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS received ECMO. In-hospital mortality was 45.9%, mean length of stay was 36.8â±â24.9âdays, and mean ICU stay was 29.1â±â17.3âdays. In-hospital mortality according to age group was 25.2% for 1 to 30âyears; 42.2% for 31 to 50âyears; 53.2% for 51 to 64âyears; and 73.7% for &#8805;65âyears. A subset analysis of COVID-19 patients, aged 18 to 64âyears with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and managed with (n = 1113) vs without (n = 16,343) ECMO, showed relatively high in-hospital mortality for both groups (44.6% with ECMO vs 37.9% without ECMO). CONCLUSIONS: In this large US study of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with ECMO, the in-hospital mortality is high but much lower than initial reports. Future research is needed to evaluate which patients with COVID-19 and ARDS would benefit from ECMO.","Nguyen, Ninh T; Sullivan, Brittany; Sagebin, Fabio; Hohmann, Samuel F; Amin, Alpesh; Nahmias, Jeffry",Ann Surg,,36
395899,The Potential Role of Coagulation Factor Xa in the Pathophysiology of COVID-19: A Role for Anticoagulants as Multimodal Therapeutic Agents,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has significantly spread information, providing people with knowledge and advice about health protection regarding COVID-19. While a previous study demonstrated that health and eHealth literacy are related to COVID-19 prevention behaviors, few studies have focused on the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. The latter includes not only preventative behaviors but also conventional health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and verify a COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire, explore its status and structure, and examine the associations between these behaviors and participants' health literacy and eHealth literacy. METHODS: A snowball sampling method was adopted to recruit participants to complete anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire surveys online that assessed sociodemographic information, self-reported coronavirus knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. RESULTS: Of 1873 college students who were recruited, 781 (41.7%) had adequate health literacy; the mean eHealth literacy score was 30.16 (SD 6.31). The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire presented a two-factor structure-COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors and conventional health behaviors-with satisfactory fit indices and internal consistency (Cronbach &#945;=.79). The mean score of COVID-19-related health behaviors was 53.77 (SD 8.03), and scores differed significantly (P<.05) with respect to residence, college year, academic major, family economic level, self-reported health status, having a family member or friend infected with coronavirus, and health literacy level. Linear regression analysis showed that health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated with COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.149, ßeHealth literacy=.368; P<.001) and conventional health behaviors (ßhealth literacy=.219, ßeHealth literacy=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire was a valid and reliable measure for assessing health behaviors during the pandemic. College students with higher health literacy and eHealth literacy can more actively adopt COVID-19-related health behaviors. Additionally, compared to health literacy, eHealth literacy is more closely related to COVID-19-related health behaviors. Public intervention measures based on health and eHealth literacy are required to promote COVID-19-related health behaviors during the pandemic, which may be helpful to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among college students.","Li, Shaojie; Cui, Guanghui; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Cheng, Sixiang; Xu, Huilan",J Med Internet Res,,36

398834,'Z plus Corden' during Covid Times,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.Importance:The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","de Vries, Maren; Mohamed, Adil S; Prescott, Rachel A; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Desvignes, Ludovic; O039,; Connor, Rebecca; Steppan, Claire; Devlin, Joseph C; Ivanova, Ellie; Herrera, Alberto; Schinlever, Austin; Loose, Paige; Ruggles, Kelly; Koralov, Sergei B; Anderson, Annaliesa S; Binder, Joseph; Dittmann, Meike",J. virol,,36

400635,COVID-19 drug practices risk antimicrobial resistance evolution,2021,"BACKGROUND: Often the first opportunity for clinicians to assess risk of preterm birth is when women present with threatened preterm labour symptoms (such as period-like pain, tightening's or back ache). However, threatened preterm labour symptoms are not a strong predictor of imminent birth. Clinicians are then faced with a complex clinical dilemma, the need to ameliorate the consequences of preterm birth requires consideration with the side-effects and costs. The QUiPP app is a validated app which can aid clinicians when they triage a women who is in threatened preterm labour. AIM: Our aim was to produce a toolkit to promote a best practice pathway for women who arrive in threatened preterm labour. METHODS: We worked with two hospitals in South London. This included the aid of a toolkit midwife at each hospital. We also undertook stakeholder focus groups and worked with two Maternity Voice Partnership groups to ensure a diverse range of voices was heard in the toolkit development. While we aimed to produce the toolkit in September 2020, we rapidly rolled out and produced the first version of the toolkit in April 2020 due to COVID-19. As the QUiPP app can reduce admissions and hospital transfers, there was a need to enable all hospitals in England to have access to the toolkit as soon as possible. RESULTS: While the rapid rollout of The QUiPP App Toolkit due to COVID-19 was not planned, it has demonstrated that toolkits to improve clinical practice can be produced promptly. Through actively welcoming continued feedback meant the initial version of the toolkit could be continually and iteratively refined. The toolkit has been recommended nationally, with National Health Service England recommending the app and toolkit in their COVID-19 update to the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle and in the British Association of Perinatal Medicine Antenatal Optimisation Toolkit.","Carlisle, Naomi; Watson, Helena A; Shennan, Andrew H",,,36

Ultrasound showed a mixed echogenic right adnexal mass with free fluid in the pelvis and abdomen. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed partially defined peripherally enhancing collection in lower abdomen and right adnexa suggestive of tubo-ovarian abscess. There was mild ileal wall thickening and few enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ascitic fluid did not show acid fast bacilli and cultures were sterile. Extensive diagnostic laboratory work was done which was inconclusive. Diagnostic laparoscopy could not be performed due to non-availability of elective operation theatre in the COVID-19 pandemic. Presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis was clinically and radiologically diagnosed. She was started on daily anti tuberculosis treatment. This case shows us the importance of imaging as a diagnostic tool and as an alternative for laparoscopy in COVID-19 pandemic to diagnose abdomino-pelvic tuberculosis.","Subramanian, Niranjana; Sagili, Haritha; Naik, Parvathi; Durairaj, Jayalakshmi",BMJ case reports,,36

The different possible interacting epitopes have been deeply analysed and characterized, providing evidence of the presence of glycan structures not found in previous MS-based analyses. The interaction of the RBD 13C-labelled glycans with different human lectins, which are expressed in different organs and tissues that may be affected during the infection process, has also been evaluated by NMR. In particular, 15N-labelled galectins (galectins-3, -7 and -8 N-terminal), Siglecs (siglec-8, siglec-10), and C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, MGL) have been employed. Complementary experiments from the glycoprotein perspective or from the lectin's point of view have permitted to disentangle the specific interacting epitopes in each case.

The resulting electrochemical biosensor was validated towards glucose oxidation in real samples and further electrochemical measurement associated with the generated H2O2. The electrochemical biosensor showed an excellent sensitivity (42.7 µA mM-1 cm-2), limit of detection (7.6 µM), linear range (20 µM-2.3 mM), and good selectivity towards glucose determination. Furthermore, and most importantly, the detection of glucose was performed at a low potential (0.2 V vs. Ag). The high performance of the electrochemical biosensor was explained through surface exploration using field emission SEM, XPS, and impedance measurements. The electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to glucose quantification in several real samples (commercial juices and a plant cell culture medium), exhibiting a high accuracy when compared with a classical spectrophotometric method. This electrochemical biosensor can be easily prepared and opens up a good alternative in the development of new sensitive glucose sensors.","Jiménez-Fiérrez, Francisco; González-Sánchez, María Isabel; Jiménez-Pérez, Rebeca; Iniesta, Jesús; Valero, Edelmira",,,36

Telehealth is broadly defined as a method to have virtual, bidirectional communication between patients and providers. Telehealth can include methods such as audio-only, video-consultation, and tele-monitoring, which can occur in a synchronous, asynchronous, or blended format. The purpose of this review is to present common foundational principles for providing clinical cancer care via telehealth, followed by an overview of three distinct examples of comprehensive telehealth programs that have been developed to meet the needs of patients and families across the cancer trajectory, including survivorship, rehabilitation, and palliative care phases. The programs described are exemplars that were developed and implemented prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so they reflect many years of planning and evidence. Lessons learned include the need for ongoing patient support, clinician training, and cancer health system/practice programmatic considerations such as billing, scheduling, reimbursement, software, and hardware/platform security. Although the COVID-19 pandemic produced an explosive shift in regulations and implementation, sustainability of these changes may not be long-term.

The lack of a specific therapeutic intervention against COVID-19 warrants the use of non-conventional potent alternatives. In recent times, probiotics have shown to mitigate numerous health challenges, including animal and human infectious diseases through competitive exclusion or antagonism of pathogens, modulation of host-microbiota, secretion of antimicrobial compounds and stimulation of immune responses. The presentation of COVID-19 as severe respiratory distress leading to gastrointestinal tract involvement could be mitigated through probiotics administration which beneficially modulates the microbiota and immune responses with an attendant reduction in morbidities, hence curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reuben, Rine Christopher; Makut, Makwin Danladi; Adogo, Lillian Yami",Pan Afr Med J,,36
410716,COVID-19 and Smoking: What Evidence Needs Our Attention?,2021,"Our study suggests that methylation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is essential for its optimal replication in the target cells. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein) was shown to mediate deposition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The levels of hNRNPA1 expression and extent of methylation varied, depending on the course of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The recruitment of eIF4E (translational initiation factor) facilitated viral RNA translation at 1 hour post infection (1 hpi). However, at 2 hpi, methylation of internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA recruited hNRNPA1 which facilitated viral RNA transcription but resulted in translational repression, a phenomenon contributing in understanding the early translation to replication switch in the viral life cycle. Besides, the abrogation of methylation also produced a defective 5 cap of viral RNA which failed to interact with eIF4E, thereby resulting in a decreased synthesis of viral proteins. To conclude, methylation of the internal and 5 cap of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was shown to regulate transcription and translation of SARS-CoV-2 in a time dependent manner. IMPORTANCERNA modifications are found in all life forms and have been linked to development, health and diseases. Our study reveals that internal SARS-CoV-2 RNA methylation (m6A) is essential for interaction with hNRNPA1 to effectively synthesize viral genome. Besides, m6A-marked RNA and hRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Blocking SARS-CoV-2 RNA methylation resulted in reduced virus yield, suggesting epitranscriptomic machinery (methylation) facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication and might represent potential target for new antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Kumar, Ram; Chander, Yogesh; Khandelwal, Nitin; Nagori, Himanshu; Verma, Assim; Pal, Yash; Gulati, Baldev Raj; Tripathi, Bhupendra Nath; Barua, Sanjay; Kumar, Naveen",,,36

Their long-term wear facilitates extensive data collection and evolving sensitivity of smart wristbands allows them to read various body vitals. In this paper, we hypothesized the use of heart rate variability (HRV) measurements to drive an algorithm that can pre-empt the onset or worsening of an affliction. Due to its significance during the time of the study, SARS-Cov-2 was taken as the case study, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was trained over its observed symptoms. The data used for the analysis was the outcome of a study hosted by Welltory. It involved the collection of SAR-Cov-2 symptoms and reading of body vitals using Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin smart bands. The internal states of the HMM were made up of the absence and presence of a consistent decline in standard deviation of NN intervals (SSDN), the root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD) in R-R intervals, and low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and very low frequency (VLF) components of the HRV measurements. The emission probabilities of the trained HMM instance confirmed that the onset or worsening of the symptoms had a higher probability if the HRV components displayed a consistent decline state. The results were further confirmed through the generation of probable hidden states sequences using the Viterbi algorithm. The ability to pre-empt the exigent state of an affliction would not only lower the chances of complications and mortality but may also help in curbing its spread through intelligence-backed decisions.","Tanwar, Gatha; Chauhan, Ritu; Singh, Madhusudan; Singh, Dhananjay",Sensors (Basel),,36

Though several deep learning approaches were developed to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as possible; Severity quantification to highlight patients with severe COVID-19, thus direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage. Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing methods could provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. We employ a multitask approach to consolidate both triage approaches and propose a convolutional neural network to leverage all available labels within a single model. In contrast with the related multitask approaches, we show the benefit from applying the classification layers to the most spatially detailed feature map at the upper part of U-Net instead of the less detailed latent representation at the bottom. We train our model on approximately 1500 publicly available CT studies and test it on the holdout dataset that consists of 123 chest CT studies of patients drawn from the same healthcare system, specifically 32 COVID-19 and 30 bacterial pneumonia cases, 30 cases with cancerous nodules, and 31 healthy controls. The proposed multitask model outperforms the other approaches and achieves ROC AUC scores of 0.87±0.01 vs. bacterial pneumonia, 0.93±0.01 vs. cancerous nodules, and 0.97±0.01 vs. healthy controls in Identification of COVID-19, and achieves 0.97±0.01 Spearman Correlation in Severity quantification.

415252,A third COVID-19 vaccine shot markedly boosts neutralizing antibody potency and breadth,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers with high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in reducing their risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease during an epidemic period. As secondary objectives, we would like to: i) assess the efficacy of the use of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers with high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in reducing their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined by seroconversion) during an epidemic period, ii) evaluate the safety of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine in adults, iii) describe the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, iv) identify clinical, analytical and microbiological predictors of COVID-19 among healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, v) set up a repository of serum samples obtained from healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for future research on blood markers to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. TRIAL DESIGN: Multicentre double-blind parallel design (ratio 1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 440 healthcare workers of four Spanish hospitals (Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau of Barcelona, Hospital Plató of Barcelona, Hospital General de Granollers, Barcelona) will be recruited. Participants are considered to be at high-risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their frequent contact with suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. For eligibility, healthcare workers with 18 years old or older working at least 3 days a week in a hospital with both negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and serological COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are invited to participate. Participants with any of the following conditions are excluded: pregnancy, breastfeeding, ongoing antiviral, antiretroviral or corticosteroids treatment, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine uptake the last month or any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine treatment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible participants will be allocated to one of the two study groups: Intervention group (PrEP): participants will receive the standard of care and will take 400mg of hydroxychloroquine (2 tablets of 200 mg per Dolquine® tablet) daily the first four consecutive days, followed by 400 mg weekly for a period of 6 months. CONTROL GROUP: participants will receive placebo tablets with identical physical appearance to hydroxychloroquine 200 mg (Dolquine®) tablets following the same treatment schedule of the intervention group. Both groups will be encouraged to use the personal protection equipment (PPE) for COVID-19 prevention according to current hospital guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint will be the number of confirmed cases of a COVID-19 (defined by a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with seroconversion) in the PrEP group compared to the placebo group at any time during the 6 months of the follow-up in healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology at day 0. As secondary endpoints, we will obtain: i) the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in the PrEP group compared to placebo during the 6 months of follow-up in healthcare workers with negative serology at day 0; ii) the occurrence of any adverse event related with hydroxychloroquine treatment; iii) the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 among healthcare workers in the non-PrEP group, among the total of healthcare workers included in the non-PrEP group during the study period; iv) the risk ratio for the different clinical, analytical and microbiological conditions to develop COVID-19; v) a repository of serum samples obtained from healthcare workers confirmed COVID-19 cases for future research on blood markers to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. RANDOMISATION: Participants meeting all eligibility requirements will be allocated to one of the two study arms (PrEP with hydroxychloroquine or non-PrEP control group) in a 1:1 ratio using simple randomisation with computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, doctors and nurses caring for participants, and investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Each intervention group will have 220 participants, giving a total of 440 participants. TRIAL STATUS: The current protocol version is 1.5, 2nd of June 2020. Two hundred and seventy-fiveparticipants were recruited and completed first month follow-up until date. The estimated sample size could not be reached yet due to the declining national epidemic curve. Thus, 275 is the total number of participants included until date. The study has been suspended (26th of June) until new epidemic curve occurs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on April 2nd 2020 at clinicaltrials.gov with the number NCT04331834.

We investigated the transmission of COVID-19 in a cluster of cases. METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 10 confirmed COVID-19 patients in an outbreak that started at Spa facility A in a local community in Korea on March 28, 2020 and traced them through April 8, 2020. Epidemiological surveys and diagnostic tests were conducted for each contact, and the secondary attack rate was estimated. RESULTS: There were 3 male confirmed patients (30.0%) and 7 female confirmed patients (70.0%), and their mean age was 53.5 years (range, 2.0 to 73.0). Two patients (20.0%) were asymptomatic. The incubation period was between 3 days and 12 days. Three confirmed patients were infected at female's Spa facility A and 7 confirmed patients were second, third, and fourth generations of transmission. Seven confirmed patients contracted COVID-19 through presymptomatic contact. In total, 192 contacts were identified, with a secondary attack rate of 3.6%. Eighty-three contacts (43.2%) were aged 40-59 years, and the secondary attack rate was the highest (12.1%) in those aged &#8805;60 years. Most exposures (n=156, 81.3%) involved casual contact. The number of visitors using the female's spa facility was 58, including 3 confirmed patients, resulting in a secondary outbreak rate of 5.9%. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a cluster of cases occurring in a setting with high temperature and humidity.

417663,Response to: Hydrogen therapy as an effective and novel adjuvant treatment against COVID-19,2020,"To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose that an ""Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine"" containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.","Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun",Front Immunol,,36

To study the dynamics of the state of the hemostasis system and the severity of the acute phase response in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. We determined APTT, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (F), D-dimers (D-d), antitrombin III (AT III), C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count in 22 patients. In 49 patients, the viscoelastic properties of a blood clot were studied by thromboelastography (TEG) with koalin. The age of the patients ranged from 40 to 77 years. According to CT, the severity of 100% cases corresponded to CT2-CT3. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) was diagnosed in 16 patients. A control group included 25 apparently healthy subjects. During hospitalization, patients with NCP were characterized by: an increase in the concentration of D-d, CRP, Fg, lengthening of APTT and PT, ATIII activity and platelet count not differing from the normal range. 10 days after hospitalization and against the background of ongoing therapy, patients with NCP showed positive dynamics in the hemostasiological profile and the severity of the inflammatory response. Thromboelastography indices in patients with LCP did not differ from control values both at hospitalization and on day 10.Thus, in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, an increased prothrombotic activity and a pronounced inflammatory response are recorded. Against the background of treatment, there is a positive dynamics in both the coagulation status and the inflammatory response. Additional studies are needed to determine the diagnostic capabilities of thromboelastography in patients with NCP.","Presnyakova, M V; Galova, E A; Sosnina, L N; Popovicheva, A N; Lyubavina, N A; Kostina, O V; Kuznetsova, V L; Karyakin, N N",Klin Lab Diagn,,36

The causative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and result in mortality in COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D is an immunomodulator hormone with established effectiveness against various upper respiratory infections. Vitamin D can stall hyper-inflammatory responses and expedite healing process of the affected areas, primarily in the lung tissue. Thus, there are ecological and mechanistic reasons to promote exploration of vitamin D action in COVID-19 patients. As no curative drugs are available currently for COVID-19, we feel that the potential of vitamin D to alter the course of disease severity needs to be investigated. Clinical studies may be undertaken to address the value of vitamin D supplementation in deficient, high-risk COVID-19 patients.","Mohan, Mradul; Cherian, Jerin Jose; Sharma, Amit",PLoS Pathog,,36

A consistent number of case reports and clinical series have been already published describing a complex spectrum of skin manifestations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out a review of the English-language literature up to 20 May 2020, reporting original cases or case series of the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The search of papers was conducted by using the key term 'COVID-19' or 'SARS-CoV-2' or 'coronavirus' combined with each of the following: 'skin', 'cutaneous', 'dermatologic' or 'dermatology', 'manifestation', 'lesions', or 'rash'. The patterns of dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be classified into four categories: exanthema (varicella-like, papulo-vesicular and morbilliform rash), vascular (chilblain-like, purpuric/petechial and livedoid lesions), urticarial and acro-papular eruption. Lastly, other skin manifestations to be considered are the cutaneous adverse reactions to the drugs prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly cause a worsening of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis remains to be determined. Dermatology's outlook in the COVID-19 pandemic is multidimensional.","Gisondi, P; PIaserico, S; Bordin, C; Alaibac, M; Girolomoni, G; Naldi, L",J. Eur. Acad. Dermatol. Venereol,,36
420269,"In Memory of James Tait Goodrich, MD, PhD, DSc (Honoris Causa): A Friend to the Craniofacial Surgeon",2020,"In this article, we investigate the binding processes of a fragment of the coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), the hexapeptide YKYRYL on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and its inhibitory effect on the binding and activation of the coronavirus-2 spike protein CoV-2 RBD at ACE2. In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a total of 1 µs and a 200-ns enhanced correlation guided MD simulation. We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the assembly process of the CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in long-time enhanced correlation guided MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that CoV-2 RBD does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates because of an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2 so that the activation of CoV-2 RBD might be inhibited in this case. Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option that prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD.","Peter, Emanuel K; Schug, Alexander",Biophys. j,,36
421244,A living WHO guideline on drugs to prevent covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mentorship in the surgical field has been increasingly recognized as a crucial component of career success. Distance mentorship models may be utilized to overcome geographic limitations, increase mentorship access, and strengthen mentoring relationships in surgery. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify the scope of literature on distance mentoring in surgery, the range of its application, its effectiveness, and any gaps in the literature that should be addressed in order to enhance mentorship in the surgical field. DESIGN: A comprehensive PubMed review was performed in January 2021 on distance mentorship of students, trainees, and surgeons in the surgical field. Reviews, replies, and non-English articles were excluded. Data was extracted regarding publication year, author's country, specialty, subjects, aim of mentorship model, and efficacy. RESULTS: 134 total studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were published in 2020, written by authors in the United States, from general surgery, and featured an expert surgeon paired with a more junior fully trained surgeon. In all, 93.3% of studies utilized distance mentorship to enhance surgical skill through telementoring and only 4.5% were focused on mentorship to enhance careers through professional development. The remaining studies utilized distance mentorship models to increase surgical research (0.7%) and clinical knowledge (1.5%). CONCLUSION: The results of this review suggest successful implementation of distance mentoring in surgery through telementoring, but a lack of professionally aimed distance mentorship programs. Amidst COVID-19, distance mentorship is particularly important because of decreased face-to-face opportunity. Future studies in the surgical field should investigate distance mentoring as a means of increasing mentorship for professional development.","Raborn, Layne N; Janis, Jeffrey E",J. surg. educ,,36
421623,Dysfunctional Coagulation in COVID-19: From Cell to Bedside,2020,"Objective: The prevalence of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is significant and it is estimated that 40% to 70% of patients with MS suffer from this impairment. COVID-19 is also a new infectious disease. The symptoms of this disease, which include fever, shortness of breath, and cough, can be mild to severe and can even lead to death. Due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs by Patients with MS, they might be at greater risk of catching COVID-19. Thus, patients with MS may be more afraid of catching the virus. One of the important factors is the relationship between cognitive deficit and the increase in patients' fear of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between fear of catching COVID-19 and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the MS Clinic, Sina hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Our participants in this project were Patients with MS who were over 18 years old and had no history of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In addition to obtaining demographic and clinical information, we measured the fear of catching the COVID 2019 via Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which is 7-item questionnaire. We also used Multiple Sclerosis Neuro Psychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ) to assess memory and information processing speed in Patients with MS. Results: After adjustment for age, gender, disease duration, highest level of education, MS type, and EDSS in linear regression model, as well as the MSNQ total score and fear score of catching coronavirus, the results demonstrated a significant positive correlation with P value of 0.00 and β: 0.024. Conclusion: The present study showed a direct relationship between cognitive disorder and level of fear regarding COVID-19. Patients with more cognitive disorders were more afraid of COVID-19.

423456,On the role of statisticians and modelers in responding to AIDS and COVID-19,2021,"Iatrogenic malnutrition and underfeeding are ubiquitous in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide for prolonged periods after ICU admission. A major driver leading to the lack of emphasis on timely ICU nutrition delivery is lack of objective data to guide nutrition care. If we are to ultimately overcome current fundamental challenges to effective ICU nutrition delivery, we must all adopt routine objective, longitudinal measurement of energy targets via indirect calorimetry (IC). Key evidence supporting the routine use of IC in the ICU includes (1) universal societal ICU nutrition guidelines recommending IC to determine energy requirements; (2) data showing predictive equations or body weight calculations that are consistently inaccurate and correlate poorly with measured energy expenditure, ultimately leading to routine overfeeding and underfeeding, which are both associated with poor ICU outcomes; (3) recent development and worldwide availability of a new validated, accurate, easy-to-use IC device; and (4) recent data in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showing progressive hypermetabolism throughout ICU stay, emphasizing the inaccuracy of predictive equations and marked day-to-day variability in nutrition needs. Thus, given the availability of a new validated IC device, these findings emphasize that routine longitudinal IC measures should be considered the new standard of care for ICU and post-ICU nutrition delivery. As we would not deliver vasopressors without accurate blood pressure measurements, the ICU community is only likely to embrace an increased focus on the importance of early nutrition delivery when we can consistently provide objective IC measures to ensure personalized nutrition care delivers the right nutrition dose, in the right patient, at the right time to optimize clinical outcomes.","Wischmeyer, Paul E; Molinger, Jeroen; Haines, Krista",Nutr Clin Pract,,36

Until a vaccine is developed, they are the community's bulwark against the pandemic. It is vital that they be protected to the maximum extent possible. This entails the need for implementation of effective and compassionate protocols to keep their workplace as safe as possible for them, their colleagues and their patients in a context of much as yet not being known about the virus and awareness that some persons infected by it are for a time at least asymptomatic and that others test negative for it when they are prodromal or even already displaying some symptomatology. This has repercussions both for the liability of hospitals and multi-practitioner centres for negligence and also under occupational health and safety legislation. With the commencement of the roll out of biosecurity and disaster/emergency measures by government and escalating levels of anxiety in the general population, it is important to reflect upon the measures that most effectively can be adopted practically and ethically to protect the health and safety of those whose task it is to care for us if we become infected by COVID-19.","Freckelton, Ian",J Law Med,,36

Although this method could limit pandemic contagion, it raises significant concerns about user privacy. Known as ~""Contact Tracing Apps"", these mobile applications are facilitated by Cellphone Service Providers (CSPs), who enable the spatial and temporal real-time user tracking. Accordingly, it might be speculated that CSPs collect information violating the privacy policies such as GDPR, CCPA, and others. To further clarify, we conducted an in-depth analysis comparing privacy legislations with the real-world practices adapted by CSPs. We found that three of the regulations (GDPR, COPPA, and CCPA) analyzed defined mobile location data as private information, and two (T-Mobile US, Boost Mobile) of the five CSPs that were analyzed did not comply with the COPPA regulation. Our results are crucial in view of the threat these violations represent, especially when it comes to children's data. As such proper security and privacy auditing is necessary to curtail such violations. We conclude by providing actionable recommendations to address concerns and provide privacy-preserving monitoring of the COVID-19 spread through the contact tracing applications.","Monroe, Callie; Tazi, Faiza; Das, Sanchari",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14155v2.pdf,36

425780,Possibility of using ultraviolet radiation for disinfecting the novel COVID-19,2021,"Human serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are the main inhibitors of serine proteases, but some of them also have the capability to effectively inhibit cysteine proteases. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) is a chymotrypsin-type cysteine protease that is needed to produce functional proteins essential for virus replication and transcription. Serpin traps its target proteases by presenting a reactive center loop (RCL) as protease-specific cleavage site, resulting in protease inactivation. Mpro target sites with its active site serine and other flanking residues can possibly interact with serpins. Alternatively, RCL cleavage site of serpins with known evidence of inhibition of cysteine proteases can be replaced by Mpro target site to make chimeric proteins. Purified chimeric serpin can possibly inhibit Mpro that can be assessed indirectly by observing the decrease in ability of Mpro to cleave its chromogenic substrate. Chimeric serpins with best interaction and active site binding and with ability to form 1:1 serpin-Mpro complex in human plasma can be assessed by using SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis with serpin antibody. Trapping SARS-CoV-2 Mpro cysteine protease using cross-class serpin cysteine protease inhibition activity is a novel idea with significant therapeutic potential.","Jairajpuri, Mohamad Aman; Ansari, Shoyab",Clin Sci (Lond),,36

The policy of social alienation and community containment was executed to reduce civic activities, which brings up numerous economic losses. It has become an urgent task for these countries to open-up, while the epidemic has almost under control. However, it still lacks sufficient literature to set appropriate open-up schemes that strike a balance between open-up risk and lock-down cost. Big data collection and analysis, which play an increasingly important role in urban governance, provide a useful tool for solving the problem. This paper explores the influence of open-up granularity on both the open-up risk and the lock-down cost. It proposes an SEIR-CAL model considering the effect of asymptomatic patients based on propagation dynamics, and offered a model to calculate the lock-down cost based on the lock-down population. A simulation experiment is then carried out based on the mass actual data of Wuhan City to explore the influence of open-up granularity. Finally, this paper proposed the evaluation score (ES) to comprehensively measure schemes with different costs and risks. The experiments suggest that when released under the non-epidemic situation, the open-up scheme with the granularity refined to the block has the optimal ES. Results indicated that the fine-grained open-up scheme could significantly reduce the lock-down cost with a relatively low open-up risk increase.","Hu, Ruimin Wang Xiaochen Ma Jianhua Pan Hao Xu Danni Wu Junhang",Big Data Research,,36

This survey presents some of the important papers which discussed how Infrared thermography can be effectively utilized for the detection of these epidemics by analyzing the temperature variations done in fever screening. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a method which uses an imaging scheme that gives you an image which is a thermal diagram that shows the temperature variations of various intensities. IRT uses the basic working principle from Stefan- Boltzmann Law, where the relationship between the temperature and the emissive power is established and the camera which is the infrared camera will capture this infrared energy and is converted into corresponding electronic signals.

There is a continuing need for clinicians to adapt practice to facilitate timely provision of medical care, whilst minimising horizontal transmission. Guidance and recommendations are increasingly available, and this rapid review aimed to provide a timely evidence synthesis on the current recommendations surrounding urogynaecological care. METHODS: We performed a literature review using PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane and a manual search of national and international societies for management recommendations for urogynaecological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Nine guidance documents and 17 articles, including 10 reviews, were included. Virtual clinics are recommended for new and follow-up patients, to assess and initiate treatment, as well as triage patients who require face-to-face appointments. Outpatient investigations such as urodynamics and cystoscopy for benign indications can be deferred. Prolapse and continence surgery should be suspended, except in specific circumstances such as procidentia with upper tract complications and failed pessaries. There is no evidence to support a particular route of surgery, but recommendations are made to minimise COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Urogynaecological patients face particular challenges owing to inherent vulnerabilities of these populations. Behavioural and medical therapies should be recommended as first line options and initiated via virtual or remote clinics, which are integral to management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding the availability and accessibility of technology will be increasingly required. The majority of outpatient and inpatient procedures can be deferred, but the longer-term effects of such practices are unclear.","Loganathan, Jemina; Doumouchtsis, Stergios K",Int. urogynecol. j.

427818,Remdesivir: A Review of Its Discovery and Development Leading to Emergency Use Authorization for Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis of unprecedented proportions that has altered the practice of medicine. The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS: A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS: Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation. Physicians should be prepared for these changes.","Kohan, Lynn; Durbhakula, Shravani; Zaidi, Munfarid; Phillips, Cdr Christopher R; Rowan, Cody C; Brenner, Gary J; Cohen, Steven P",,,36

We found that 15 minutes' treatment of viral inoculum (105 plaque-forming units; PFU) or SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with paraformaldehyde or 70% ethanol resulted in complete inactivation of the virus. The treatment of infected hamster lung tissues with 10% neutral buffered formalin also fully inactivated the virus. However, only 3 kDa ultracentrifuge filter was effective in eliminating the virus to an undetectable limit in the filtrate. Our validated methods are useful for decontaminating biological samples to reduce infection risk and safe handling in BSL2 facilities.","Kumar, Ranjeet; Kolloli, Afsal; Subbian, Selvakumar",,,36
430356,Knowledge Graphs for COVID-19: An Exploratory Review of the Current Landscape,2021,"Actuality One of the most widely discussed treatments for patients with COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the epidemy, was the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The first small non-randomized trials showed the ability of HCQ and its combination with azithromycin to accelerate the elimination of the virus and ease the acute phase of the disease. Later, large, randomized trials did not confirm it (RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY). This study is a case-control study in which we compared patients who received and did not receive HCQ.Material and Methods 103 patients (25 in the HCQ treatment group and 78 in the control group) with confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 26 of 73 in the control group (35.6%) and in 10 of 25 (40%) in the HCQ group) and in the rest - a typical picture of viral pneumonia on multislice computed tomography [MSCT]) were included in the analysis. The severity of lung damage was limited to stages I-II, the CRP level should not exceed 60 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation in the air within 92-98%. We planned to analysis the duration of treatment of patients in the hospital, the days until the normalization of body temperature, the number of points according to the original SHOCS-COVID integral scale, and changes in its components (C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and the percentage of lung damage according to MSCT).Results Analysis for the whole group revealed a statistically significant increase in the time to normalization of body temperature from 4 to 7 days (by 3 days, p&lt;0.001), and the duration of hospitalization from 9.4 to 11.8 days (by 2.4 days, p=0.002) when using HCQ in comparison with control. Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 46 patients who were matched by propensity score matching. The trend towards similar dynamics continued. HCQ treatment slowed down the time to normalization of body temperature by 1.8 days (p=0.074) and lengthened the hospitalization time by 2.1 days (p=0.042). The decrease in scores on the SHOCS -COVID scale was statistically significant in both groups, and there were no differences between them (delta - 3.00 (2.90) in the HCQ group and - 2.69 (1.55) in control, p=0.718). At the same time, in the control group, the CRP level returned to normal (4.06 mg/dl), and with the use of GC, it decreased but remained above the norm (6.21 mg/dl, p=0.05). Side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were reported in 3 patients in the HCQ group and none in the control group.Conclusion We have not identified any positive properties of HCQ and its ability to influence the severity of COVID-19. This antimalarial agent slows down the normalization of the body's inflammatory response and lengthens the time spent in the hospital. HCQ should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kamalov, A A; Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Akopyan, Z A; Mareev, Yu V; Mershina, E A; Begrambekova, Yu L; Pakhomov, P V",Kardiologiia,,36
430650,Responding to COVID-19: Perspectives From the Chinese Society of Gastroenterology,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. METHODS: This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 µg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

432541,Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose,2021,"This study examines the effect of Income Support Programs (ISPs) on job search effort, work- place mobility, COVID-19 cases, and mortality growth rates. To identify ISPs' causal effect, I use the variation in their introductions' timing across countries and implement a difference-in-difference and multi-event analysis method. I find that ISPs led to a 4.4-8.29 percentage points reduction in workplace mobility and a 6.6-11.6 percentage points reduction in job search effort levels. They also caused a 21.8-47.7 and 17.1-29.7 percentage points reduction in the COVID-19 case growth rate and COVID-19 mortality growth rates, respectively. Using the event analysis estimates, I simulated the counterfactual job search effort, workplace mobility, and the number of COVID-19 cases and mortality without income support programs. The average global job search effort and workplace mobility without ISPs would have been 11.12 and 9.26 percent higher than the observed mean job search effort and workplace mobility. However, these would have come at the cost of 3.69 million and 166, 690 additional COVID-19 cases and mortality than the cases and deaths registered by May 15th.","Asfaw, Abraham Abebe",Econ Hum Biol,,36
432701,"COVID-19, pulmonary mast cells, cytokine storms, and beneficial actions of luteolin",2020,"Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) are soluble innate immune molecules which maintain lung homeostasis through their dual roles as anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agents. SP-A and SP-D bind numerous viruses including influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enhancing their clearance from mucosal points of entry and modulating the inflammatory response. They also have diverse roles in mediating innate and adaptive cell functions and in clearing apoptotic cells, allergens and other noxious particles. Here, we review how the properties of these first line defense molecules modulate inflammatory responses, as well as host-mediated immunopathology in response to viral infections. Since SP-A and SP-D are known to offer protection from viral and other infections, if their levels are decreased in some disease states as they are in severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), this may confer an increased risk of viral infection and exacerbations of disease. Recombinant molecules of SP-A and SP-D could be useful in both blocking respiratory viral infection while also modulating the immune system to prevent excessive inflammatory responses seen in, for example, RSV or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recombinant SP-A and SP-D could have therapeutic potential in neutralizing both current and future strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus as well as modulating the inflammation-mediated pathology associated with COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human (rfh)SP-D has recently been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Further work investigating the potential therapeutic role of SP-A and SP-D in COVID-19 and other infectious and inflammatory diseases is indicated.","Watson, Alastair; Madsen, Jens; Clark, Howard William",Front Immunol,,36

The purpose of this paper is to explore data trends from the pandemic regarding infection rates/policy impact, and draw learning points for informing the unlocking process. METHODS: The daily published cases in England in each of 149 Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) areas were converted to Average Daily Infection Rate (ADIR), an R-value - the number of further people infected by one infected person during their infectious phase with Rate of Change of Infection Rate (RCIR) also calculated. Stepwise regression was carried out to see what local factors could be linked to differences in local infection rates FINDINGS: By the 19th April 2020 the infection R has fallen from 2.8 on 23rd March before the lockdown and has stabilised at about 0.8, sufficient for suppression. However there remain significant variations between England regions. Regression analysis across UTLAs found that the only factor relating to reduction in ADIR was the historic number of confirmed number infection/000 population, There is however wide variation between Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA) areas. Extrapolation of these results showed that unreported community infection may be 150 times higher than reported cases, providing evidence that by the end of the second week in April, 26.8% of the population may already have had the disease and so have increased immunityExtrapolation of these results showed that unreported community infection may be 150 times higher than reported cases, providing evidence that by the end of the second week in April, 26.8% of the population may already have had the disease and so have increased immunity.

433356,COVID-19 testing before every endoscopy: Is India ready for prime time?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vietnam has emerged as one of the world's leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing. FINDINGS: We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased. INTERPRETATION: The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.

Children with conduct problems have difficulty with rule adherence, and linking early conduct problems with later adherence to COVID-19 guidelines can provide new insight into public health. The current study employed a sample (N = 744) designed to examine the longitudinal consequences of childhood conduct problems (Mean age at study entry = 8.39). The first objective was to link early conduct problems with later adherence to both general and specific COVID-19 guidelines during emerging adulthood (M age = 19.07). The second objective was to prospectively examine how interactional (i.e., callous unemotional traits, impulsivity) and cumulative (i.e., educational attainment, work status, substance use) continuity factors mediated this association. The third objective was to examine differences in sex assigned at birth in these models. Direct associations were observed between childhood conduct problems and lower general, but not specific COVID-19 guideline adherence. Conduct problems were indirectly associated with both general and specific adherence via higher levels of callous unemotional traits, and with specific adherence via higher problematic substance use. No differences in the models were observed across sex assigned at birth. Findings provide insight into both how developmental psychopathology constructs are useful for understanding COVID-19 guideline adherence, and the ways in which conduct problems may shape health outcomes.","Martin-Storey, Alexa; Temcheff, Caroline; Déry, Michèle; Lapalme, Mélanie; Tomasiello, Melina; Mariamo, Audrey; Lemelin, Jean-Pascal",Res Child Adolesc Psychopathol,,36

Retrospective analyses reported a markedly increased rate of VTEs in COVID-19. However, most recent studies on coagulopathy in COVID-19 were only focused on critically ill patients, and without suitable control groups. We aimed to evaluate the rate of VTEs in an all-comers cohort with suspected COVID-19 during a 30-days follow-up period. We also studied the level of D-dimers and their association with the course of disease. In our prospective single-center study (DRKS00021206, 03/30/2020), we analyzed 190 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted to the emergency department between March and April 2020. Forty-nine patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive (25.8%). The 141 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients served as control group. After completion of a 30-days follow-up, VTE was diagnosed in 3 patients of the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (6.1%, amongst these 2 ICU cases) versus 5 patients in the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (3.5%), however the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.427). 30-days mortality was similar in both groups (6.1% vs. 5%, p = 0.720). Disease severity correlated with the maximum level of D-dimers during follow-up in COVID-19. The rate of VTE was numerically higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive all-comers presenting with suspected COVID-19 as compared to well-matched controls suffering from similar symptoms. VTEs in the COVID-19 group predominantly occurred in ICU courses. The maximum level of D-dimers during follow-up was associated with disease severity in COVID-19, whereas the level of D-dimers at admission was not.","Rieder, Marina; Goller, Isabella; Jeserich, Maren; Baldus, Niklas; Pollmeier, Luisa; Wirth, Luisa; Supady, Alexander; Bode, Christoph; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Schmid, Bonaventura; Duerschmied, Daniel; Gauchel, Nadine; Lother, Achim",J Thromb Thrombolysis,,36

Gaining a stronger understanding of factors associated with an increased likelihood of RSDBs among traumatised individuals offers potential new avenues for research and treatment. Mounting evidence indicates relations between traumatic experiences and deficits/disturbances in characteristics of positive memories; however, relations between RSDBs and positive memory characteristics has been understudied. Using hierarchical multiple regression, we examined relations between positive memory characteristics (Memory Experiences Questionnaire-Short Form; MEQ-SF) and RSDBs, controlling for PTSD and depression severity, among a sample of treatment-seeking trauma-exposed individuals (N = 77; Mage = 33.96; 57.10% female). Results indicated that MEQ-SF subscales of Accessibility, Coherence, Emotional Intensity, and Sensory Details were significantly associated with engagement in RSDBs, above and beyond PTSD and depressive severity. Those who easily accessed emotionally evocative positive memories tended to engage in elevated RSDBs; those with less coherence and fewer sensory details in their positive memories were also more likely to engage in RSDBs.

The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. We performed separate testing in a sealed glove box, offering complete biosafety containment. Thus, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system can help decentralize COVID-19 testing and offer rapid test results for patients in remote and low-resourced settings.","Zowawi, Hosam M; Alenazi, Thamer H; AlOmaim, Waleed S; Wazzan, Ahmad; Alsufayan, Abdullah; Hasanain, Rihab A; Aldibasi, Omar S; Althawadi, Sahar; Altamimi, Sarah A; Mutabagani, Maysoon; Alamri, Maha; Almaghrabi, Reem S; Al-Abdely, Hail M; Memish, Ziad A; Alqahtani, Saleh A",J. clin. microbiol,,36

To effectively harness promising new technologies and address these and other public health challenges ahead, public health professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting and improving public health. This project sought to understand the network of health departments and organizations that provide training in order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby strengthening the public health system. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting Region V of the Department of Health & Human Services. The survey focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics to examine the network. RESULTS: Of 290 participating health departments (58% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248 LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10 national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected to the state health department for training than to any other organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with its number of training connections. CONCLUSIONS: State health departments may benefit from the support of universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs. Additional qualitative information from local and state health departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations to participate in training local practitioners to improve LHD capacity.","Harris, Jenine K; Leider, Jonathon P; Kulik, Phoebe; Beck, Angela",J. public health manag. pract.

437153,Current pharmacological treatments for COVID-19: What's next?,2020,"When patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems: virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug described to shorten recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) could be an alternative treatment option. In this case report, we present two kidney transplant recipients and two hemodialysis patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received CP. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined sequentially by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay and specific cellular responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (&#8804;1:40). ELISpot responses in the four patients were either weak or absent. After CP treatment, we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific cellular responses.

438293,Reply to: Is presymptomatic spread a major contributor to COVID-19 transmission?,2020,"Modelling the spread of coronavirus globally while learning trends at global and country levels remains crucial for tackling the pandemic. We introduce a novel variational-LSTM Autoencoder model to predict the spread of coronavirus for each country across the globe. This deep Spatio-temporal model does not only rely on historical data of the virus spread but also includes factors related to urban characteristics represented in locational and demographic data (such as population density, urban population, and fertility rate), an index that represents the governmental measures and response amid toward mitigating the outbreak (includes 13 measures such as: 1) school closing, 2) workplace closing, 3) cancelling public events, 4) close public transport, 5) public information campaigns, 6) restrictions on internal movements, 7) international travel controls, 8) fiscal measures, 9) monetary measures, 10) emergency investment in health care, 11) investment in vaccines, 12) virus testing framework, and 13) contact tracing). In addition, the introduced method learns to generate a graph to adjust the spatial dependences among different countries while forecasting the spread. We trained two models for short and long-term forecasts. The first one is trained to output one step in future with three previous timestamps of all features across the globe, whereas the second model is trained to output 10 steps in future. Overall, the trained models show high validation for forecasting the spread for each country for short and long-term forecasts, which makes the introduce method a useful tool to assist decision and policymaking for the different corners of the globe.","Ibrahim, Mohamed R; Haworth, James; Lipani, Aldo; Aslam, Nilufer; Cheng, Tao; Christie, Nicola",PLoS One,,36

442225,Inhaled NO and COVID-19,2020,"Diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality is predominantly due to complications of the disease that may cause debilitating conditions, such as heart and renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Fibrosis, the excessive and inappropriate deposition of extracellular matrix in various tissues, is commonly found in patients with advanced type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to organ dysfunction. Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance activate a fibrotic response, not only through direct stimulation of matrix synthesis by fibroblasts, but also by promoting a fibrogenic phenotype in immune and vascular cells, and possibly also by triggering epithelial and endothelial cell conversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. High glucose stimulates several fibrogenic pathways, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, stimulating neurohumoral responses, activating growth factor cascades (such as TGF-ß/Smad3 and PDGFs), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, generating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and stimulating the AGE-RAGE axis, and upregulating fibrogenic matricellular proteins. Although diabetes-activated fibrogenic signaling has common characteristics in various tissues, some organs, such as the heart, kidney and liver develop more pronounced and clinically significant fibrosis. This review manuscript summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in diabetic fibrosis, discussing the fundamental links between metabolic perturbations and fibrogenic activation, the basis for organ-specific differences, and the promises and challenges of anti-fibrotic therapies for diabetic patients.","Tuleta, Izabela; Frangogiannis, Nikolaos G",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,36

A putative role for the tobacco mosaic virus in smokers’ resistance to COVID-19 Medical Hypotheses, 110153",2020,"The funeral industry is a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance. The occurrence, human exposure and health risks of antibiotic resistance in the funeral industry were examined. The funeral industry harbours antibiotic resistance to multiple common and last-resort antibiotics, hence constitutes the 'thanato-resistome'. Hydrological processes, air-borne particulates and vectors disseminate antibiotic resistance, while horizontal gene transfer circulates antibiotic resistance among resistomes, forming a complex network. Ingestion, inhalation of air-borne particulates, dermal intake and clothes of workers contribute to human exposure. Human health risks include; development of drug resistance in previously susceptible pathogens, and increased morbidity and mortality caused by increased pathogenicity and outbreaks of multi-drug resistant infections. Ecological risks include the proliferation of resistant organisms at the expense of susceptible ones, thereby disrupting ecosystem structure and function, including biogeochemical cycles. Barring inferential data, quantitative evidence linking antibiotic resistance to human infections is weak. This reflects the lack of systematic quantitative studies, rather than the absence of such health risks. Quantitative risk assessment is constrained by lack of quantitative data on antibiotic resistance in various reservoirs and exposure routes. A framework for risk assessment and mitigation is proposed. Finally, ten hypotheses and emerging tools such as genomics, in silico techniques and big data analytics are highlighted.","Gwenzi, Willis",Sci Total Environ,,36

The aim of this study was to assess the problems faced by patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was carried out with a focus on effects on disease control, continuity of medical care, drug procurance and prevalent fears in the patient population. RESULTS: Of the 608 participants (81.1% female, median (s.d.) age 57 (13.9) years), dermatomyositis was the most frequent subtype (247, 40.6%). Patients reported health-related problems attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 195, 32.1%); specifically 102 (52.3%) required increase in medicines, and 35 (18%) required hospitalization for disease-related complications. Over half (52.7%) of the surveyed patients were receiving glucocorticoids and/or had underlying cardiovascular risk factors (53.8%), placing them at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Almost one in four patients faced hurdles in procuring medicines. Physiotherapy, critical in the management of IIM, was disrupted in 214 (35.2%). One quarter (159, 26.1%) experienced difficulty in contacting their specialist, and 30 (4.9%) were unable to do so. Most (69.6%) were supportive of the increased use of remote consultations to maintain continuity of medical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This large descriptive study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has incurred a detrimental effect on continuity of medical care for many patients with IIM. There is concern that delays and omissions in clinical care may potentially translate to poorer outcomes in the future.","Gupta, Latika; Lilleker, James B; Agarwal, Vikas; Chinoy, Hector; Aggarwal, Rohit",Rheumatology (Oxford),,36
445281,Inequity in Crisis Standards of Care,2020,"This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","Williams, Roger; Alessi, Charles; Alexander, Graeme; Allison, Michael; Aspinall, Richard; Batterham, Rachel L; Bhala, Neeraj; Day, Natalie; Dhawan, Anil; Drummond, Colin; Ferguson, James; Foster, Graham; Gilmore, Ian; Goldacre, Raphael; Gordon, Harriet; Henn, Clive; Kelly, Deirdre; MacGilchrist, Alastair; McCorry, Roger; McDougall, Neil; Mirza, Zulfiquar; Moriarty, Kieran; Newsome, Philip; Pinder, Richard; Roberts, Stephen; Rutter, Harry; Ryder, Stephen; Samyn, Marianne; Severi, Katherine; Sheron, Nick; Thorburn, Douglas; Verne, Julia; Williams, John; Yeoman, Andrew",Lancet,,36

Additionally, we describe an efficient algorithm for exactly computing the expected waiting times of both low-priority and high-priority customers, requiring only the truncation of sums that converge exponentially quickly. These insights are used to demonstrate how the accumulation rate and delay level should be chosen by health care practitioners to optimize common key performance indicators (KPIs). In particular, we demonstrate that for certain nontrivial KPIs, an accumulating priority queue with a delay of zero is always preferable. Finally, we present a detailed investigation of the quality of an exponential approximation to the high-priority waiting time distribution, which we use to optimize the choice of queueing parameters with respect to both classes' waiting time distributions.","Bilodeau, Blair; Stanford, David A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06054v3.pdf,36

We have not had the possibility to use a secure teleconferencing software. In our unit we had not technological devices. Surgeons in our department were not able to use remote video technology for patient management. Guidelines for an appropriate selection of patients which could be served via telemedicine had to be created.

In order to understand the chemical behavior of the ISM and specific cases like the missing sulfur reservoir, a detailed chemical molecular composition in the ISM must be mapped out. Aims: Our goal is to investigate the rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide, CH3CH2SCH3, which ms to be a potential candidate for observation in the ISM since the simpler analogs, CH3SH and CH3CH2SH, have already been detected. Rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide has been observed before, but its experimental rotational parameters are not precise enough to allow its detection in the ISM. Methods: The rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide in the frequency range 72-116.5 GHz was measured using a broadband millimeter-wave spectrometer based on radio astronomy receivers with fast Fourier transform backends. The spectral searches and identification of the vibrational excited states of ethyl methyl sulfide was supported by high-level ab initio calculations on the harmonic and anharmonic force fields. Results: The rotational spectra for the trans and gauche conformers of ethyl methyl sulfide was analyzed, and a total of 172 and 259 rotational transitions were observed for each one, respectively. The observation of A - E internal rotation splittings allowed the experimental determination of the V 3 hindered internal rotation barrier height for both trans and gauche species.

PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs currently working in an environment with direct exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are eligible to participate in the trial. The trial aims to be conducted across 20-30 centres (public and private hospitals) in India. HCWs who decline consent, who have a confirmed COVID-19 infection, those who are already on chloroquine/HCQ for any indication, or if pregnant or breast-feeding, or have known QT prolongation or are on medications that when taken with HCQ can prolong the QTc will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions to be compared in this trial are standard practice (use of recommended PPE) and HCQ plus standard practice. In the standard practice arm, HCWs will use recommended PPE as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles. They will be discouraged from taking HCQ to prevent contamination and contacted every week for the duration of the study to ascertain if they have taken any HCQ. Any such use will be reported as a protocol violation. In the intervention arm, HCWs will be administered 800mg of HCQ as a loading dose on the day of randomization (as two 400mg doses 12hrs apart) and subsequently continued on 400mg once a week for 12 weeks. This will be in addition to the use of recommended PPE as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles. HCWs will collect the drug once every week from designated research and pharmacy staff at site. A weekly phone reminder will be provided to participants in this arm to ensure compliance. An ECG will be performed between 4-6 weeks in this arm and if the QTc is prolonged (greater than 450milliseconds), the drug will be stopped. Follow-up will however continue. Participants in both arms will receive a weekly phone call for evaluation of the primary outcome, to monitor protocol compliance and development of any adverse events (in the HCQ group). MAIN OUTCOMES: Participants will be followed on a weekly basis. The primary outcome is the proportion of HCWs developing laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection within 6 months of randomization. We will also evaluate a number of secondary outcomes, including hospitalization related to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection, intensive care unit or high-dependency unit admission due to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection, all-cause mortality, need for organ support ( non-invasive or invasive ventilation, vasopressors and renal replacement therapy), ICU and hospital length of stay, readmission, days off work and treatment-related adverse events. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be conducted through a password-protected, secure website using a central, computer-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by participating institutions and by the role of HCW - nursing, medical and other. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to either standard practice only or HCQ plus standard practice. Allocation concealment is maintained by central web-based randomisation BLINDING (MASKING): This is an unblinded study: study assigned treatment will be known to the research team and participant. Bias will be mitigated through an objective end point (laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 6,950 HCWs will be enrolled (3475 to the intervention) and (3475 to the standard practice group) to detect a 25% relative reduction, or 2.5% absolute reduction, in the infection rate from an estimated baseline infection rate of 10%, with 80% statistical power using a two-sided test at 5% level of significance. Available data from China and Italy indicate that the rate of infection among frontline healthcare workers varies between 4% to 12%. We therefore assumed a baseline infection rate of 10% among HCWs. This sample size allows for a potential loss to follow-up rate of 10% and a potential non-compliance rate of 10% in both the treatment and control arms.

450710,Opioid-Induced Hearing Loss and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: Clinical Considerations for Audiologists and Recommendations for Future Research,2020,"The focus of this research is how Sicilian state university mathematics professors faced the challenge of teaching via distance education during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the pandemic entered our lives suddenly, the professors found themselves having to lecture using an e-learning platform that they had never used before, and for which they could not receive training due to the health emergency. In addition to the emotional aspects related to the particular situation of the pandemic, there are two aspects to consider when teaching mathematics at a distance. The first is related to the fact that at university level, lecturers generally teach mathematics in a formal way, using many symbols and formulas that they are used to writing. The second aspect is that the way mathematics is taught is also related to the students to whom the teaching is addressed. In fact, not only online, but also in face-to-face modality, the teaching of mathematics to students on the mathematics degree course involves a different approach to lessons (as well as to the choice of topics to explain) than teaching mathematics in another degree course. In order to investigate how the Sicilian State university mathematics professors taught mathematics at distance, a questionnaire was prepared and administered one month after the beginning of the lockdown in Italy. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were made, which allowed us to observe the way that university professors have adapted to the new teaching modality: they started to appropriate new artifacts (writing tablets, mathematical software, e-learning platform) to replicate their face-to-face teaching modality, mostly maintaining their blackboard teacher status. Their answers also reveal their beliefs related to teaching mathematics at university level, noting what has been an advantageous or disadvantageous for them in distance teaching.","Cassibba, Rosalinda Ferrarello Daniela Mammana Maria Flavia Musso Pasquale Pennisi Mario Taranto Eugenia",Education Sciences,,36

451049,Long COVID guidelines need to reflect lived experience,2021,"In today’s competitive business environment, the cost of a product is one of the most important considerations for its sale. Businesses are heavily involved in research strategies to minimize the cost of elements that can impact on the final price of the product. Logistics is one such factor. Numerous products arrive from diverse locations to consumers in today’s digital era of online businesses. Clearly, the logistics sector faces several dilemmas from order attributes to environmental changes in this regard. This has specially been noted during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic where the demands on online businesses have increased several fold. Consequently, the methodology to optimise delivery cost and its impact on environmental focus by reducing CO2 emissions has gained relevance. The resultant strategy of Shipment Consolidation that has evolved is an approach that combines one or more transport orders in the same vehicle for delivery. Shipment Consolidation has been categorized in three order scheduling approaches: Time based consolidation, Quantity based consolidation, and a Hybrid (Time-Quantity) based consolidation. In this paper, a new Hybrid Consolidation approach is presented. Using the Hybrid approach, it has been shown that order delivery can be facilitated by taking into account not only the order pick up time, but also the total order quantity. These results have shown that if a time window is available in respect of the order delivery time, then the order can be delayed from pickup to consolidate it with other orders for cost optimization. This hybrid approach is based on four consolidation principles, two of which work on fixed departure and two, on demand departure. Three of these rules have been implemented and tested here with an application case study. Statistical analysis of the results is illustrated with different planning evaluation indicators. The Result analyses indicate that consolidation of orders is increased with each implemented rule hence motivating us towards the implementation of the fourth rule. Testing with bigger data sets is required. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.","Memon, M.

However, only rigorously prepared analyses can serve as the highest level of evidence for a specified research question. We have aimed to determine (1) what is the methodological quality of recent SR/MA conducted to assess the efficacy of probiotics; (2) whether the results of SR/MA have a clinical application; and (3) what are factors associated with better quality and applicability of the SR/MA. We systematically searched 4 databases for SR/MA on the probiotics efficacy published in 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42020222716). The AMSTAR 2 tool and pre-defined authors' criteria were used to evaluate methodological quality and clinical applicability, respectively. A total of 114 SR/MA were appraised. In the case of 88 papers (77%), the overall confidence in the results was rated as ""critically low"". The most prevalent flaws were lack of list of excluded studies with justification (79.8%), lack of study protocol (60.5%), and problems with appropriate results combination(54.4%). A declaration of conduction a probiotic efficacy SR/MA could have been misleading in case of 18 studies that included also synbiotics, paraprobiotics, and prebiotics trials in analyses. Only 14 SR/MA provided results that can be apply in clinical practice. Higher journal impact factor and European affiliation of the 1st and corresponding authors were most consistently associated with higher odds of AMSTAR 2 items fulfillments. Based on our findings, SR/MA of probiotics trials cannot be treated as the highest level of evidence without a careful evaluation of their methodological validity.","Ruszkowski, Jakub; Majkutewicz, Katarzyna; Rybka, Ewelina; Kutek, Marcin; Debska-Slizien, Alicja; Witkowski, Jacek M",Biomed Pharmacother,,36

Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge; therefore, early recognition of severe forms is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients. While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity. Clinicians should consider low lymphocyte count as well as the serum levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, cardiac troponin and IL-6, which may be used in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 in hospitalised patients. It is more likely that the course of the disease will be unfavourable if some or all of these parameters are altered.","Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P; Meyer, Christian G",Int J Infect Dis,,36

METHODS: Fresh donor corneas and primary explant cultures of corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. Using immunohistochemistry, the samples were tested for the expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS: In total, 5 donor corneas were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. In all specimens, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed throughout the surface epithelium (corneal, limbal, and conjunctival) and corneal endothelium. In corneal stromal cells, ACE2 was sporadically expressed, whereas TMPRSS2 was absent. DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR expression varied between donor specimens. Four specimens expressed DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in a similar distribution to ACE2, but 1 specimen from a young donor showed no expression of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR were all expressed in the cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Both corneal and conjunctival epithelia express ACE2, DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR, and TMPRSS2, suggesting that the ocular surface is a potential route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The risk of viral transmission with corneal transplantation cannot be ruled out, given the presence of ACE2 in corneal epithelium and endothelium. Cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells mimic the expression of viral entry factors in fresh donor tissue and may be useful for future in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection studies.","Roehrich, Heidi; Yuan, Ching; Hou, Joshua H",Cornea,,36

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PATRICIA is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II trial. Patients had received 2-4 prior lines of anti-HER2-based regimens. Treatment consisted of palbociclib 200 mg daily for 2 weeks and 1 week off plus trastuzumab. The study was based on a Simon two-stage design comprising three cohorts: estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (cohort A), ER-positive (cohort B1), and ER-positive with letrozole (cohort B2). ER-positive patients were randomized to cohorts B1 or B2. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6). Secondary objectives included safety and evaluation of the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were recruited (n = 15 in cohort A and 28 in each cohort B). The PFS6 rate in cohorts A, B1, and B2 was 33.3% (5/15), 42.8% (12/28), and 46.4% (13/28), respectively. Regarding safety, grade 1-2 and 3-4 toxicities occurred in 97.7% and 84.4% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (66.4%) and thrombocytopenia (11.3%). Regarding PAM50, 59 (83.1%) tumors were profiled. Luminal disease defined by PAM50 was found independently associated with longer PFS compared with non-luminal disease (10.6 vs. 4.2 months median PFS; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.40; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib in combination with trastuzumab is safe and exhibits promising survival outcomes in trastuzumab pretreated ER-positive/HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with a PAM50 Luminal A or B subtype.

The study demonstrated abnormal sub-pleural high T2 signal intensity change within in the partially visualised lungs, which showed enhancement following administration of contrast. Concern was raised that the pulmonary changes may represent COVID-19 infection. The patient was urgently contacted and denied any current symptoms but reported suffering mild upper respiratory tract symptoms two weeks earlier. An outpatient chest radiograph demonstrated changes consistent with COVID-19 infection and the patient was treated as COVID-19 positive and advised to self-isolate for 7 days as per Public Health England guidance. Due to increasing breathlessness the patient presented to our emergency department the next day and underwent a CT pulmonary angiogram which demonstrated segmental pulmonary emboli and sub-pleural consolidation in keeping with COVID-19 infection. This represents the first case of COVID-19 identified on breast MR imaging that the authors have seen and highlights the importance of prompt identification and flagging of incidental pulmonary findings to minimise further transmission of the virus in asymptomatic carriers.","Brown, Adam; Dluzewski, Sam; Malhotra, Anmol",Radiol.

The existing models based on convolutional neural networks contain a giant number of parameters, and thus require multi-advanced GPUs to deploy. In this paper, we are the first to develop the adaptive morphological neural networks to classify chest X-ray images, such as pneumonia and COVID-19. A novel structure, which can self-learn morphological dilation and erosion, is proposed to determine the most suitable depth of the adaptive layer. Experimental results on the chest X-ray and the COVID-19 datasets show that the proposed model can achieve the highest classification rate as compared against the existing models. Moreover, it can significantly reduce the computational parameters of the existing models by 97%. The advantage makes the developed model more attractive than others to deploy in the internet and other device platforms.

456996,Do biomarkers of COVID-19 severity simply reflect a stress response in type 2 diabetes: Biomarker response to hypoglycemia,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Corona virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly. Growing evidences that overweight and obesity which extent nearly a third of the world population were associated with severe COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the association and risk of increased BMI and obesity with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of ICU admission, ARDS, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, and mortality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in meta-analysis with 9 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 10 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (cut-off &#8805;30 kg/m2). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 1.12 (95% CI, 0.67-1.57, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, obesity was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95% CI, 1.25-2.54, P < 0.001) Multivariate meta-regression showed the association between BMI and obesity on composite poor outcome were affected by age, gender, DM type 2, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should always be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.","Soeroto, Arto Yuwono; Soetedjo, Nanny Natalia; Purwiga, Aga; Santoso, Prayudi; Kulsum, Iceu Dimas; Suryadinata, Hendarsyah; Ferdian, Ferdy",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,36
457289,COVID-19 vaccine research and the trouble with clinical equipoise,2021,"Nanoparticle-based therapeutic and detectable modalities can augment anticancer efficiency, holding potential in capable target and suppressive metastases post administration. However, the individual discrepancies of the current ""one-size-fits-all"" strategies for anticancer nanotherapeutics have heralded the need for ""personalized therapy"". Benefiting from the special inherency of various cells, diverse cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CMCNs) were established on a patient-by-patient basis, which would facilitate the personalized treatment of individual cancer patients. CMCNs in a complex microenvironment can evade the immune system and target homologous tumors with a suppressed immune response, as well as a prolonged circulation time, consequently increasing the drug accumulation at the tumor site and anticancer therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the emerging strategies and advances of CMCNs to synergistically integrate the merit of source cells with nanoparticulate delivery systems for the orchestration of personalized anticancer nanotherapeutics, thus discussing their rationalities in facilitating chemotherapy, imaging, immunotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic, magnetocaloric, chemodynamic and gene therapy. Furthermore, the mechanism, challenges and opportunities of CMCNs in personalized anticancer therapy were highlighted to further boost cooperation from different fields, including materials science, chemistry, medicine, pharmacy and biology for the lab-to-clinic translation of CMCNs combined with the individual advantages of source cells and nanotherapeutics.","Chen, Xuerui; Liu, Bingbing; Tong, Rongliang; Zhan, Lin; Yin, Xuelian; Luo, Xin; Huang, Yanan; Zhang, Junfeng; He, Wen; Wang, Yanli",Biomaterials science,,36
457300,COVID-19 Neutralizing Antibody Surveillance Testing for Fully Vaccinated Individuals During Delta Variant Spread,2021,"How can parental leave design be more socially inclusive? Should all parents be entitled to parental benefits or only those parents who are eligible based on a particular level of labour market participation? To think through questions of social inclusion in parental leave policy design, particularly issues related to entitlements to benefits, I make three arguments. First, aiming to extend Dobrotić and Blum’s work on entitlements to parental benefits, I argue that ‘mixed systems’ that include both citizenship‐based and employment‐based benefits are just and socially inclusive approaches to parental leaves and citizenship. Second, to build a robust conceptual scaffolding for a ‘mixed’ benefits approach, I argue that that we need to attend to the histories and relationalities of the concepts and conceptual narratives that implicitly or explicitly inform parental leave policies and scholarship. Third, and more broadly, I argue that a metanarrative of care and work binaries underpins most scholarship and public and policy discourses on care work and paid work and on social policies, including parental leave policies. In this article, I outline revisioned conceptual narratives of care and work relationalities, arguing that they can begin to chip away at this metanarrative and that this kind of un‐thinking and rethinking can help us to envi‐ sion parental leave beyond employment policy—as care and work policy. Specifically, I focus on conceptual narratives that combine (1) care and work intra‐connections, (2) ethics of care and justice, and (3) ‘social care,’ ‘caring with,’ transforma‐ tive social protection, and social citizenship. Methodologically and epistemologically, this article is guided by my reading of Margaret Somers’ genealogical and relational approach to concepts, conceptual narratives, and metanarratives, and it is written in a Global North socio‐economic context marked by the COVID‐19 pandemic and 21st century neoliberalism.","Doucet, Andrea",Social Inclusion,,36

Thus, the considerable occupational risk in pediatric dentistry is evident, given the nature and form of procedures performed in an outpatient setting. Thus, the aim of this paper was to identify and contextualize technical and scientific information available to date aimed at preventing and minimizing risks for patients, caregivers and professionals. The results indicate that protective measures are being developed considering procedures according to risks and benefits, and five points stand out: 1. Regulation of resumption of elective procedures, screening and scheduling patients; 2. Restructuring clinical environment and infection control; 3. Improvement of personal protective equipment and biosafety recommendations; 4. Maximization of the use of non-invasive techniques, use of high-powered dental suction, and absolute isolation of the operative field; and 5. Minimization of the use of air-water syringe, dental spittoon and high-speed handpiece. The measures to be taken require reflection for the restart of a “new clinical practice”, especially aiming at behavioral and structural changes regarding operational biosafety.","de Amorim, Lívia Mund; Maske, Tamires Timm; Ferreira, Simone Helena; Dos Santos, Rubem Beraldo; Feldens, Carlos Alberto; Kramer, Paulo Floriani",Pesqui.

The circadian day-night is the rhythmic clue to organisms for their synchronized body functions. The ""development for mankind"" escalated the use of artificial light at night (ALAN). In this article, we tried to focus on the possible influence of this anthropogenic factor in human coronavirus (HCoV) outbreak. The relationship between the occurrences of coronavirus and the ascending curve of the night-light has also been delivered. The ALAN influences the physiology and behavior of bat, a known nocturnal natural reservoir of many Coronaviridae. The ""threatened"" and ""endangered"" status of the majority of bat species is mainly because of the destruction of their proper habit and habitat predominantly through artificial illumination. The stress exerted by ALAN leads to the impaired body functions, especially endocrine, immune, genomic integration, and overall rhythm features of different physiological variables and behaviors in nocturnal animals. Night-light disturbs ""virus-host"" synchronization and may lead to mutation in the genomic part of the virus and excessive virus shedding. We also proposed some future strategies to mitigate the repercussions of ALAN and for the protection of the living system in the earth as well.","Khan, Zeeshan Ahmad; Yumnamcha, Thangal; Mondal, Gopinath; Devi, Sijagurumayum Dharmajyoti; Rajiv, Chongtham; Labala, Rajendra Kumar; Sanjita Devi, Haobijam; Chattoraj, Asamanja",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,36

Adolescents are considered particularly vulnerable to a problematic usage of digital applications For the first systematic investigation of screen time and problematic usage patterns over the course of the pandemic, a pre-pandemic survey on adolescent social media (SM) and gaming use was extended to a longitudinal study Here we present the results of the first two measurements points (pre-pandemic/under lockdown) Methods: A representative sample of 1,221 adolescents (10–17 years) participated in an online survey in 09/2019, 824 of them in 04/2020 Prevalence rates were measured at baseline with standardized scales covering ICD-11 criteria for problematic usage patterns These were statistically compared and related to pre- and under-lockdown screen time Results: Pre-pandemic prevalence rates for pathological SM/gaming were about 3 % each, for at-risk usage 8–10 % including more boys than girls Usage frequencies and screen times significantly increased under the lockdown The predictive value of usage patterns for screen time decreased from before to during the lockdown Changes in screen time could not be predicted by the usage pattern Discussion: The stability of the observed rates and effects should be further examined over the course of the pandemic This will lead to relevant implications for prevention measures and the allocation of intervention resources

assoziierter Verhaltenssüchte ausgelöst Adoleszente scheinen hierbei besonders gefährdet Für eine systematische Untersuchung von Nutzungszeiten und problematischen Nutzungsmustern im Verlauf der Pandemie, wurde eine vor dem Ausbruch der Pandemie durchgeführte Erhebung zum Mediennutzungsverhalten unter Jugendlichen zu einer Längsschnittstudie mit drei zusätzlichen Messzeitpunkten erweitert Das vorliegende Manuskript präsentiert die Ergebnisse der ersten beiden abgeschlossenen Erhebungen zu den Zeitpunkten vor der Pandemie und während des ersten Lockdowns Methode: Eine repräsentative Stichprobe von 1221 10- bis 17-jährigen Kindern und Jugendlichen in Deutschland nahm an der Baseline-Befragung (09/2019) teil 824 von ihnen konnten für die Follow-up-Messung (04/2020) gewonnen werden Zur Schätzung der Prävalenzen riskanter und pathologischer Gaming-/SM-Nutzung nach ICD-11-Kriterien wurden standardisierte Instrumente eingesetzt Die Nutzungszeiten von Games und SM wurden zu beiden Messzeitpunkten abgefragt, mittels t-tests statistisch verglichen und durch lineare Regressionsanalysen auf Zusammenhänge mit Nutzungsmustern untersucht Ergebnisse: Zur Baseline erfüllten 10 % der Jugendlichen die Kriterien für riskantes und 2,7 % die Kriterien für pathologisches Gaming 8,2 % wurden als riskante und 3,2 % als pathologische SM Nutzer klassifiziert 1,3 % erreichten den Cut-off für beide pathologischen Nutzungsmuster und 5,7 % für ein kombiniertes mindestens riskantes Nutzungsmuster Jungen zeigten häufiger als Mädchen eine riskante Nutzung von Games und SM sowie pathologisches Gaming Unter dem Lockdown nahmen die Häufigkeit und die Dauer der Nutzung von Games und SM deutlich zu Der Vorhersagewert problematischer Nutzungsmuster in Bezug auf Nutzungszeiten nahm vom ersten zum zweiten Messzeitpunkt ab (gaming: R 2vor Pandemie=0 23 to R 2unter lockdown=0 08;SM: R 2vor Pandemie=0 07 to R 2unter lockdown=0 03) Er war in Bezug auf den Anstieg der Nutzungszeiten vernachlässigbar Schlussfolgerungen: Die COVID-19-Pandemie stellt ein großes Risiko für die physische, aber auch eine große Belastung für die psychische Gesundheit der Gesamtbevölkerung dar Mit zunehmenden Nutzungszeiten von Games und SM bei Kindern und Jugendlichen steigt potenziell das Risiko für problematische Nutzungsmuster unter der Pandemie Dieser Zusammenhang ist jedoch mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit nicht linear Die Ergebnisse der nächsten Messzeitpunkte müssen abgewartet werden, um die Stabilität der beobachteten Effekte zu überprüfen und die Prävalenzraten unter der Pandemie

We also evaluated a primary school setting (with student-educator ratios 30:1, 15:1 and 8:1), including cohorts that alternate weekly. In the childcare centre setting, grouping siblings significantly reduced outbreak size and student-days lost. We identify an intensification cascade specific to classroom outbreaks of respiratory viruses with presymptomatic infection. In both childcare and primary school settings, each doubling of class size from 8 to 15 to 30 more than doubled the outbreak size and student-days lost (increases by factors of 2-5, depending on the scenario.

463904,Human papillomavirus vaccination after COVID-19,2021,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was noted to produce severe cardiac arrhythmia, an adverse effect as its use against severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SAES-CoV-2). HCQ is an antimalarial drug with quinoline structure. Some other quinoline compounds, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs), also lead to arrhythmias characterized by QT prolongation. QT prolongation is usually related to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel inhibitory activity of most drugs. In this research, molecular docking was used to study the potential inhibitory activities of HCQ as well as other quinolines derivatives and hERG potassium channel protein. The possible causes of these QT prolongation effects were revealed. Molecular docking and patch clamp experiments showed that HCQ could bind to hERG and inhibit the efflux of potassium ion preferentially in the repolarization stage. The IC50 of HCQ was 8.6 µM ± 0.8 µM. FQs, which are quinoline derivatives, could also bind to hERG molecules. The binding energies of FQs varied according to their molecular polarity. It was found that drugs with a quinoline structure, particularly with high molecular polarity, can exert a significant potential hERG inhibitory activity. The potential side effects of QT prolongation during the development and use of quinolines should be carefully considered.","Yu, Ran; Li, Peng",Toxicology,,36

In this paper, we describe the DSC-WAV program, an NSF-funded data science workforce development project in which teams of undergraduate sophomores and juniors work with a local non-profit organization on a data-focused problem. To help students develop a sense of agency and improve confidence in their technical and non-technical data science skills, the project promoted a team-based approach to data science, adopting several processes and tools intended to facilitate this collaboration.

466562,Therapeutic strategies to fight COVID-19: Which is the status artis?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the response to a virtual educational curriculum in reconstructive urology presented during the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess learner satisfaction with the format and content of the curriculum, including relevance to learners' education and practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A webinar curriculum of fundamental reconstructive urology topics was developed through the Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons and partnering institutions. Expert-led sessions were broadcasted. Registered participants were asked to complete a survey regarding the curriculum. Responses were used to assess the quality of the curriculum format and content, as well as participants' practice demographics. RESULTS: Our survey yielded a response rate of 34%. Survey responses showed >50% of practices offer reconstructive urologic services, with 37% offered by providers without formal fellowship training. A difference in self-reported baseline knowledge was seen amongst junior residents and attendings (P < .05). Regardless of level of training, all participants rated the topics presented as relevant to their education/practice (median response = 5/5). Responders also indicated that the curriculum supplemented their knowledge in reconstructive urology (median response = 5/5). The webinar format and overall satisfaction with the curriculum was highly rated (median response = 5/5). Participants also stated they were likely to recommend the series to others. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate success of an online curriculum in reconstructive urology. Given >50% of practices surveyed offer reconstruction, we believe the curriculum's educational benefits (increasing access and collaboration while minimizing the risk of in-person contact) will continue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and that this will remain a relevant educational platform for urologists moving forward.","Omil-Lima, Danly; Fernstrum, Austin; Gupta, Karishma; Jella, Tarun; Muncey, Wade; Mishra, Kirtishri; Bukavina, Laura; Scarberry, Kyle; DeLong, Jessica; Nikolavsky, Dmitriy; Gupta, Shubham",Urology,,36

Several strategies were used by teachers worldwide to continue their teaching activities. Objective: to investigate the strategies and uses of ICT in medical education in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Five databases were systematically assessed, using the terms ""COVID-19"", ""medical education"", ""higher education"" and ""students"", in Portuguese, English and Spanish, resulting in 321 initial citations, with 18 final references after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: Four key topics were identified in the literature: (1) Challenges for Medical Education prior to COVID-19; (2) Challenges in migrating to remote education; (3) Strategies to overcome challenges related to the learning environment; and (4) Strategies to overcome challenges related to assessments and exams. Conclusion: The use of ICT in medical education in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic showed to be especially important, with considerations regarding the improvement in areas that were already used, the migration of some more articulated areas and experiences in clinical and procedural disciplines. There was also concern about the impacts of using ICT to replace the in-person presence of students in medical learning environments.","Moretti-Pires, Rodrigo Otávio; Campos, Dalvan Antônio de; Tesser Junior, Zeno Carlos; Oliveira Junior, João Batista de; Turatti, Bárbara de Oliveira; Oliveira, Daniel Canavese de",Rev. bras. educ. méd,,36

This review focuses on the research performed during the last five years to provide an updated view of the current position of tea regarding human health. According to most authors, tea health benefits can be traced back to its bioactive components, mostly phenolic compounds. Among them, catechins are the most abundant. Tea has an important antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory properties, which make this beverage (or its extracts) a potential aid in the fight against several chronic diseases. On the other hand, some studies report the possibility of toxic effects and it is advisable to reduce tea consumption, such as in the last trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, new technologies are increasing researchers' possibilities to study the effect of tea on human gut microbiota and even against SARS CoV-2. This beverage favours some beneficial gut microbes, which could have important repercussions due to the influence of gut microbiota on human health.","Hinojosa-Nogueira, Daniel; Pérez-Burillo, Sergio; Pastoriza de la Cueva, Silvia; Rufián-Henares, José Ángel",Food Funct,,36

Molecular tests are the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, but are carried out at central laboratories, delaying treatment and control decisions. Here we describe a portable assay system for rapid, onsite COVID-19 diagnosis. Termed CODA (CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection reached 3 copy/µL. When applied to clinical samples (10 confirmed COVID-19 patients; 10 controls), the rapid CODA test accurately classified COVID-19 status, in concordance with gold-standard clinical diagnostics.","Lee, Chang Yeol; Degani, Ismail; Cheong, Jiyong; Lee, Jae-Hyun; Choi, Hyun-Jung; Cheon, Jinwoo; Lee, Hakho",Biosens Bioelectron,,36

Although share bikes are playing an important role as data sources in data mining, they could be of help but are rarely reported in pandemic-related researches. Based on the share bike records in Beijing, we constructed a behavior pattern analysis framework, then analyzed the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of residents, figured out the key time nodes of different pandemic periods, and demonstrated the variations in mobility due to the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions. The impact of the pandemic was assessed by performing co-location analysis between share bike usage and POIs (Point Of Interest). Classification of POIs is helpful to distinguish the behavior patterns generated by various the productive and social activities.

Antibodies can be powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections. Here, we use the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9 × 10-14 M are achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements compared to corresponding IgGs. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and IgG-like bioavailability. The MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody or MB) platform thus uniquely leverages binding avidity together with multi-specificity to deliver ultrapotent and broad neutralizers against SARS-CoV-2. The modularity of the platform also makes it relevant for rapid evaluation against other infectious diseases of global health importance.

Limited reports describing EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 have been published. These articles reported nonspecific encephalopathic patterns, epileptiform discharges, and rarely seizures. Our primary aim was to assess EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate for epileptiform activity or seizures. METHODS: We identified five critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who underwent EEG monitoring. All patients had Ceribell&#8482; rapid response EEG initially and two continued with conventional long-term video EEG. RESULTS: All 5 patients had encephalopathy and 3 also had seizure-like movements, thus prompting EEG monitoring. EEGs all showed nonspecific markers of encephalopathy including diffuse slowing and generalized rhythmic delta activity. Two also had epileptiform discharges reaching 2-3 Hz at times, with one patient in nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the other developing clinical status epilepticus with myoclonic movements. EEG and clinical symptoms improved with anti-seizure medications. CONCLUSION: Status epilepticus was present in 2 out of our cohort of 5 critically ill patients who underwent EEG monitoring. These findings highlight the importance of EEG monitoring in high-risk patients with COVID-19 and encephalopathy. EEG recordings in such patients can identify pathological patterns that will benefit from treatment with anti-seizure medications.","Chen, Wendy; Toprani, Sheela; Werbaneth, Katherine; Falco-Walter, Jessica",Seizure,,36

Data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme show that one in four healthcare facilities globally lacks a functional water source on premises (i.e., basic water service); in sub-Saharan Africa, half of all healthcare facilities have no basic water services. But even these data do not tell the whole story, other water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assessments in low-resource healthcare facilities have shown the detrimental effects of seasonal or temporary water shortages, nonfunctional water infrastructure, and fluctuating water quality. The rapid spread of COVID-19 forces us to reexamine prevailing norms within national health systems around the importance of WASH for quality of health care, the prioritization of WASH in healthcare facility investments, and the need for focused, cross-sector leadership and collaboration between WASH and health professionals. What COVID-19 reveals about infection prevention in low-resource healthcare facilities is that we can no longer afford to ""work around"" WASH deficiencies.

475316,P124 Delivering bronchiectasis physiotherapy clinics remotely: patient perceptions and future preferences,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perceived educational and health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic amongst dental students and educators. METHODS: A 17-item electronic survey was sent to 496 undergraduate dental students and 53 clinical faculty members who attended clinical sessions during the outbreak period. The survey explored various aspects related to primary sources and prevention of disease exposure, dental management of suspected cases, impact of COVID-19 on students' clinical performance and effects of suspension of educational activities on academic performance and clinical competence. RESULTS: The response rate of the students' was 60.7% (n = 301). The majority of students reported that performing clinical work during the outbreak posed significant health concerns, resulted in a significant stress and negatively affected their clinical performance. The majority of students believed that aerosols generated during dental procedures are the major source for disease exposure and universal protective equipment is not effective for prevention. The decision to suspend teaching activities was supported by 89% of the students. Opinions were divided regarding the impact of the suspension on the academic performance and clinical competence. Educational videos were the most preferred form of distance education. The response rate of faculty members was 60.4% (n = 32). Responses of faculty members were similar to students, though fewer concerns were reported regarding the risk of disease transmission. All respondents agreed that extra-precautionary measures are required to ensure optimum protection against disease exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected various elements of dental education. High levels of major health risk perception were noted amongst students and educators. The interruption to academic and clinical activities may lead to an inevitable skill deficit within the new generation of dental graduates. Educators are under significant pressure to accommodate abrupt changes in teaching methods, find solutions to mitigate skill deficit and ensure safe clinical practice once clinical activities are resumed.","Jum039,; ah, Ahmad A; Elsalem, Lina; Loch, Carolina; Schwass, Donald; Brunton, Paul A",Eur. j. dent. educ,,36

A call for evidence-based research in the fight against COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: Reliable data on the course and treatment of pediatric COVID-19 (""corona virus disease 2019"") in immunosuppressed patients with rheumatic diseases are missing. AIM: Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. METHODS: In May 2020 all GKJR members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different stages of the disease were collected. RESULTS: A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA­4 and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral steroids, mycophenolate, IL­1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation was emphasized by many respondents. CONCLUSION: The currently low prevalence of COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience.

It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.","Janda, A; Schuetz, C; Heeg, M; Minden, K; Hedrich, C M; Kallinich, T; Hinze, C; Schulz, A; Speth, F",Z Rheumatol,,36
475564,Long-term consequences of SARS-COV2 infection: Long-Covid patterns and possible public health implications,2021,"Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is an established marker of ovarian reserve that decreases with age. Though the pool of ovarian follicles is established during fetal development, impacts of in utero exposures on AMH are uncertain. Thus, we sought to evaluate associations of in utero exposures with AMH of adult daughters with a prospective cohort study of adult daughters at university medical centers. Women noted their mother's reported use of diethylstilbestrol (DES), vitamins, tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine during pregnancy, and their mother's occupation during pregnancy. All participants were reproductive age women (18-40 years) enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial. Serum AMH concentrations were measured at baseline prior to conception and categorized using clinical guidelines. Multinomial regression models estimated associations between each exposure and high (>3.5 ng/mL) and low (<1.0 ng/mL) versus normal AMH (1.0-3.5 ng/mL), adjusting for participant's age, mother's age, mother's history of fertility treatment, and mother's use of vitamins. In 1202 women with available data, maternal caffeine use was associated with an increased risk of low AMH, compared to normal (relative risk [RR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 3.30). Vitamins were associated with an increased risk of high AMH compared to normal (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24, 3.00). Other exposures were not associated with AMH concentrations in offspring. Maternal caffeine and vitamin use during pregnancy may be associated with ovarian reserve in adult offspring, highlighting the potential importance of pregnancy lifestyle on the reproductive health of daughters.","Eubanks, Allison A; Nobles, Carrie J; Hill, Micah J; DeCherney, Alan H; Kim, Keewan; Sjaarda, Lindsey A; Perkins, Neil J; Ye, Aijun; Zolton, Jessica R; Silver, Robert M; Schisterman, Enrique F; Mumford, Sunni L",Reprod. toxicol.

This paper examined the impact of strategic interfirm alliance on small-scale industries (SSI) amid the threat of COVID-19 pandemic in Nsukka, a local geographic space in Nigeria. A survey research design and a questionnaire survey of 82 SSIs were used in the paper. The data for the paper were analyzed using descriptive statistics while tables and percentages were used to illustrate the results. Results in the study revealed that 15.47%, 22.45%, and 44.20% of the respondents have experienced relative increase, increased, and significant increase, respectively, in COVID-19-induced challenges on their operations. The paper also showed that 24.81%, 25.01%, and 34.64% of the industries have experienced relative increase, increase, and significant increase, respectively, in their operations following their use of alliance, while 5.06% and 10.48% have experienced relative and significant decreases. The paper suggests that SSIs in Nigeria should adopt/institutionalize the use of strategic interfirm alliance in their operations in order to survive the COVID-19-induced challenges which have distrupted their production flow. © The Author(s) 2021.","Nwokocha, V.

METHODS: Age, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte (MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the thresholds for five bio-markers, and their prognostic values were assessed via the Kaplan-Meier curve and multivariate COX regression models. RESULTS: The median age was 46.4 years old, and 37cases were females. A total of 27.8% of patients had been to Wuhan, and 73.1% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms. Elevated NLR and age were significantly associated with illness severity. The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-4.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65-4.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19. NLR exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.841, with the highest specificity (63.6%) and sensitivity (88%). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated age and NLR can be considered independent biomarkers for indicating poor clinical outcomes.","Yang, Ai-Ping; Liu, Jian-Ping; Tao, Wen-Qiang; Li, Hui-Ming",Int Immunopharmacol,,36

This study aimed to determine the anxiety level of emergency medical services professionals in Ankara, Turkey after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the first part of the survey, the participants of the study were asked about their socio-demographic characteristics and their contact with the COVID-19 patients. In the second part, a survey with 20 questions that determined the state anxiety level derived from the State Anxiety Inventory was performed after obtaining verbal consent. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.1±6.9, while 52.7% of all participants were males. In this study, the mean STAI Anxiety Score was 50.7±11.6. Anxiety scores were higher in females and those who had family members at risk of COVID-19 infection (p<0.05). The majority of those who had family members at risk of the infection started to stay in guesthouses instead of going home. Participants were worried about transmitting the infection to their family members (p<0.05). They felt more anxious when treating COVID-19 diagnosed or other patients (p<0.05). In addition, they thought that their anxiety level increased in general (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused an anxiety increase in EMS workers in Turkey. Protecting the physical and mental health of the EMS employees who work at the front line against the COVID-19 pandemic and who have a high risk of infection, and ensuring their efficient work should be the main priority.","Usul, Eren; San, Ishak; Bekgöz, Burak",Psychiatr Danub,,36

A growing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We performed a systematic review of GI symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as of the serum levels of biomarkers related to liver function and lesion in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). With regard to clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a non-severe disease. Some studies showed increased aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels in a portion of the 209 analyzed patients and two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that digestive symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients. In addition, alterations in cytolysis biomarkers could also be observed in a lesser proportion, calling attention to the possibility of hepatic involvement in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.","Silva, Filipe Antônio França da; Brito, Breno Bittencourt de; Santos, Maria Luísa Cordeiro; Marques, Hanna Santos; Silva Júnior, Ronaldo Teixeira da; Carvalho, Lorena Sousa de; Vieira, Elise Santos; Oliveira, Márcio Vasconcelos; Melo, Fabrício Freire de",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,36

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic literature review investigating treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine, and to evaluate barriers and challenges. Additionally, we review recent regulatory changes that affect telemedicine in neurosurgery, and our institution's initial experience. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including all studies investigating success regarding treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine. We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic billing records after telemedicine was implemented from 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020 and reviewed modifier 95 inclusion to determine the number of face-to-face and telemedicine visits, as well as breakdown of weekly telemedicine clinic visits by subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies (25 prospective and 27 retrospective) with 45 801 patients were analyzed. A total of 13 studies were conducted in the United States and 39 in foreign countries. Patient management was successful via telemedicine in 99.6% of cases. Telemedicine visits failed in 162 cases, 81.5% of which were due to technology failure, and 18.5% of which were due to patients requiring further face-to-face evaluation or treatment. A total of 16 studies compared telemedicine encounters to alternative patient encounter mediums; telemedicine was equivalent or superior in 15 studies. From 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020, our department had 122 telemedicine visits (65.9%) and 63 face-to-face visits (34.1%). About 94.3% of telemedicine visits were billed using face-to-face procedural codes.

Due the COVID-19 pandemic, several restrictive measures have been implemented by the State federation's governments, and cancer diagnosis reference centers were also impacted by these measures. Thus, this study aimed to compare SUS-oriented cancer diagnosis in Brazil before and during the pandemic so far. The average number of cancer diagnoses has dropped considerably in all Brazilian Regions since the pandemic period started. The number of new cancer cases has plunged in all regions, ranged from -24.3% in the North to -42.7% in Northeast region. The overall Brazilian average deficit reached 35.5%, corresponding to about 15,000 undiagnosed cases of cancer monthly. The pandemic period has dramatically reduced the diagnosis of new cases of cancer in Brazil, since consultations in public health services were compromised by restrictive measures. Therefore, effective measures must be urgently put in action in order to minimize the damage, and consequently, the negative health impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the care of cancer patients.","Marques, Nelson Pereira; Silveira, Denise Maria M; Marques, Nádia Carolina Teixeira; Martelli, Daniella Reis Barbosa; Oliveira, Eduardo A; Martelli-Júnior, Hercílio",Semin. oncol,,36

481965,Exosome therapeutics for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses,2021,"The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic has spread to 210 countries worldwide. It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19's cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing.","Agbehadji, Israel Edem; Awuzie, Bankole Osita; Ngowi, Alfred Beati; Millham, Richard C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,36

METHODS: We identified all elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients who underwent our universal COVID-19 testing protocol during our phased reopening between May 1, 2020, and July 21, 2020, at our institution. We recorded the SARS-CoV-2 test results of each patient along with their demographics, medical comorbidities, and symptoms at the time of testing. We followed each of these positive patients through their rescheduled cases and recorded any complications or potential SARS-CoV-2 healthcare exposures. RESULTS: Of the 2,329 patients, we identified five patients (0.21%) with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test, none with symptoms. All patients were successfully rescheduled and underwent their elective arthroplasty procedure within 6 weeks of their original surgery date. None of these patients experienced a perioperative complication at the time of their rescheduled arthroplasty procedure. No orthopaedic surgeon or staff member caring for these patients reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Our phased reopening protocol with universal preoperative virus testing was safe and identified a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic, elective arthroplasty patients at our institution. With uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this research can guide future policy decisions regarding elective surgery.","Zangrilli, Julian; Hameed, Daniel; Chisari, Emanuele; Vannello, Chris; Courtney, P Maxwell; Krueger, Chad A",J.

The collision between the Covid-19 pandemic and the current diabesity epidemic has highlighted that obese and diabetic patients have a worse prognosis due to the impairment of the immune response to infections and due to the mechanical limits that make the management of the hospitalized patients with severe obesity more difficult. The limitations imposed on accessibility to non-urgent care during the lockdown of ""phase 1"" of this pandemic have created the need to revolutionize clinical practice to meet the health demands of chronic and high-risk diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The use of technology and risk stratification to establish the priority of access to the treatments that we have been forced to undertake will be useful tools for a new phase of a more efficient and successful treatment of diabesity.","Guarisco, Gloria; Leonetti, Frida",Eat. weight disord,,36

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies.","Butler, Daniel; Mozsary, Christopher; Meydan, Cem; Foox, Jonathan; Rosiene, Joel; Shaiber, Alon; Danko, David; Afshinnekoo, Ebrahim; MacKay, Matthew; Sedlazeck, Fritz J; Ivanov, Nikolay A; Sierra, Maria; Pohle, Diana; Zietz, Michael; Gisladottir, Undina; Ramlall, Vijendra; Sholle, Evan T; Schenck, Edward J; Westover, Craig D; Hassan, Ciaran; Ryon, Krista; Young, Benjamin; Bhattacharya, Chandrima; Ng, Dianna L; Granados, Andrea C; Santos, Yale A; Servellita, Venice; Federman, Scot; Ruggiero, Phyllis; Fungtammasan, Arkarachai; Chin, Chen-Shan; Pearson, Nathaniel M; Langhorst, Bradley W; Tanner, Nathan A; Kim, Youngmi; Reeves, Jason W; Hether, Tyler D; Warren, Sarah E; Bailey, Michael; Gawrys, Justyna; Meleshko, Dmitry; Xu, Dong; Couto-Rodriguez, Mara; Nagy-Szakal, Dorottya; Barrows, Joseph; Wells, Heather; O039,; Hara, Niamh B; Rosenfeld, Jeffrey A; Chen, Ying; Steel, Peter A D",Nat Commun,,36

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients who were hospitalized between March 10 and April 10, 2020 were included. RESULTS: Among 222 patients, mean age was higher in SARI/critical disease group (p < 0,001). Median time from illness onset to admission, presence of co-morbidity, especially coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was significantly higher in severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)/critical disease group (p < 0.05). Cough and fever were the most common symptoms, while anosmia and loss of taste were observed in 8.6 % and 7.7 % patients, respectively. Mortality rate was 5.4 %. High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, low lymphocyte, monocyte and platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, low GFR, high levels of muscle enzymes, ferritin and IL-6 on admission were found to be associated with SARI/critical disease (p<0.05). Bilateral ground-glass opacity and patchy infiltration were more frequently seen in SARI/critical disease group (p < 0.001). Patients older than 65 years have 8-fold increased risk for development of SARI/critical disease. CONCLUSION: This cohort study regarding COVID-19 cases in Turkey reveals that older age, presence of co-morbidity, bilateral infiltration on CT, high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, low monocyte and platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, low GFR, high levels of muscle enzymes, and high levels of ferritin and IL-6 on admission are predictors of SARI and severe disease.","Güner, Rahmet; Hasanoglu, Imran; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Aypak, Adalet; Kaya Kalem, Ayse; Eser, Fatma; Özdemir, Burcu; Saricaoglu, Elif Mukime; Ayhan, Müge; Aybar Bilir, Yesim; Özkoçak Turan, Isil; Erdem, Deniz; Mutlu, Nevzat Mehmet; Buzgan, Turan; Dinç, Bedia; Akinci, Esragül",,,36
488369,Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on chronic drug-resistant pain patients treated using brain stimulation approaches,2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that COVID-19-associated severe respiratory failure (CARDS) might differ from usual acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to failing autoregulation of pulmonary vessels and higher shunt. We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 04/2020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. RESULTS: CARDS patients (n = 10) had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS (n = 10) patients. Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4 ± 8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9 ± 4.3 J/min; P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (P < 0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (P > 0.05) and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups. The arteriovenous pCO2 difference (âµpCO2) was elevated (CARDS 5.5 ± 2.8 mmHg vs. ARDS 4.7 ± 1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05), as was the P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (CARDS mean 2.2 ± 1.5 vs. ARDS 1.7 ± 0.8; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients seems to differ only slightly from ARDS regarding ventilation characteristics and pulmonary hemodynamics. Our data indicate microcirculatory dysfunction. More data need to be collected to assure these findings and gain more pathophysiological insights into COVID-19 and respiratory failure.","Becker, André; Seiler, Frederik; Muellenbach, Ralf M; Danziger, Guy; Kamphorst, Maren; Lotz, Christopher; Bals, Robert; Lepper, Philipp M",J Intensive Care Med,,36
488993,Effects of COVID-19 Home Confinement on Mental Health in Individuals with Increased Risk of Alzheimer's Disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). METHODS: 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. RESULTS: Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. LIMITATIONS: Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.","Di Blasi, Maria; Gullo, Salvatore; Mancinelli, Elisa; Freda, Maria Francesca; Esposito, Giovanna; Gelo, Omar Carlo Gioacchino; Lagetto, Gloria; Giordano, Cecilia; Mazzeschi, Claudia; Pazzagli, Chiara; Salcuni, Silvia; Lo Coco, Gianluca",J Affect Disord,,36

As the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 have many parallels with influenza, it is important to ensure optimal management of both respiratory diseases as we anticipate their continued co-circulation. In particular, there is a need to ensure that effective surveillance and diagnostic capacities are in place to monitor these and other respiratory viruses, as this will underpin decisions on the appropriate clinical management of the respective diseases. As such, we propose a series of key recommendations for stakeholders, public health authorities, primary care physicians and surveillance bodies that will help mitigate the combined risks of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. We advocate the judicious use of influenza vaccines and antivirals, particularly among groups at high risk of complications, with healthcare workers also considered a priority for vaccination. It is likely that the increased use of emerging technologies such as telemedicine and contact tracing will permanently change our approach to managing infectious disease. The use of these technologies, alongside existing pharmaceutical strategies, will ensure that we achieve a holistic approach to the global public health measures needed to deal with the combined threat of influenza and COVID-19. Ensuring that this approach is optimal will be key as we move from a reactive pandemic response towards preparing for the long-term management of the remarkable clinical burden associated with these respiratory pathogens.","Chotpitayasunondh, Tawee; Fischer, Thea Kølsen; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Hurt, Aeron C; Monto, Arnold S; Osterhaus, Albert; Shu, Yuelong; Tam, John S",Influenza other respir. viruses,,36

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of specimen pooling for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten previously tested nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimens of varying viral concentrations. Specimen pooling did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2 when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of original specimen was lower than 35. In specimens with low viral load (Ct > 35), 2 of 15 pools (13.3%) were false negative. Pooling specimens to test for Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection in low prevalence (&#8804;1%) areas or in low risk populations can dramatically decrease the resource burden on laboratory operations by up to 80%. This paves the way for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with a low incidence of infection, or with lower-risk populations.","Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Kaewpom, Thongchai; Ampoot, Weenassarin; Ghai, Siriporn; Khamhang, Worrawat; Worachotsueptrakun, Kanthita; Wanthong, Phanni; Nopvichai, Chatchai; Supharatpariyakorn, Thirawat; Putcharoen, Opass; Paitoonpong, Leilani; Suwanpimolkul, Gompol; Jantarabenjakul, Watsamon; Hemachudha, Pasin; Krichphiphat, Artit; Buathong, Rome; Plipat, Tanarak; Hemachudha, Thiravat",J. med. virol,,36

These non-traditional data sources are becoming vital for disease forecasts and surveillance when preparing for epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. In this paper, we present GeoCoV19, a large-scale Twitter dataset containing more than 524 million multilingual tweets posted over a period of 90 days since February 1, 2020. Moreover, we employ a gazetteer-based approach to infer the geolocation of tweets. We postulate that this large-scale, multilingual, geolocated social media data can empower the research communities to evaluate how societies are collectively coping with this unprecedented global crisis as well as to develop computational methods to address challenges such as identifying fake news, understanding communities' knowledge gaps, building disease forecast and surveillance models, among others.","Qazi, Umair; Imran, Muhammad; Ofli, Ferda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11177v1.pdf,36
492546,Possible consequences of Covid-19 on the nervous system,2020,"OBJECTIVES: During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Northern Italy had to completely reorganize its hospital activity. In Lombardy, the hub-and-spoke system was introduced to guarantee emergency and urgent cardiovascular surgery, whereas most hospitals were dedicated to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to analyse the results of the hub-and-spoke organization system. METHODS: Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Monzino) became one of the four hubs for cardiovascular surgery, with a total of eight spokes. SARS-CoV-2 screening became mandatory for all patients. New flow charts were designed to allow separated pathways based on infection status. A reorganization of spaces guaranteed COVID-19-free and COVID-19-dedicated areas. Patients were also classified into groups according to their pathological and clinical status: emergency, urgent and non-deferrable (ND). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were referred to the Monzino hub-and-spoke network. We performed 41 operations, 28 (68.3%) of which were emergency/urgent and 13 of which were ND. The screening allowed the identification of COVID-19 (three patients, 7.3%) and non-COVID-19 patients (38 patients, 92.7%). The newly designed and shared protocols guaranteed that the cardiac patients would be divided into emergency, urgent and ND groups. The involvement of the telematic management heart team allowed constant updates and clinical discussions. CONCLUSIONS: The hub-and-spoke organization system efficiently safeguards access to heart and vascular surgical services for patients who require ND, urgent and emergency treatment. Further reorganization will be needed at the end of this pandemic when elective cases will again be scheduled, with a daily increase in the number of operations.","Bonalumi, Giorgia; Giambuzzi, Ilaria; Barbone, Alessandro; Ranieri, Camilla; Cavallotti, Laura; Trabattoni, Piero; Naliato, Moreno; Polvani, Gianluca; Torracca, Lucia; Pelenghi, Stefano; Ragni, Franco; Russo, Claudio Francesco; Guerra, Francisco; Trimarchi, Santi; Civilini, Efrem; Romani, Federico; Bellosta, Raffaello; Losa, Sergio; Roberto, Maurizio; Alamanni, Francesco",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,36

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients with lymphoma hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to analyze pre-Covid-19 determinants of mortality. Methods: This retrospective multicentric cohort study used the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information database to identify all adult patients with lymphoma, hospitalized for Covid-19 in March and April 2020, in 12 hospitals of three French regions with pandemic outbreaks. The characteristics of lymphoma and Covid-19 were collected from medical charts. Findings: Eighty-nine patients were included. The median age was 67 years (range, 19-92), 66% were male and 72% had a comorbidity. Most patients had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (86%) and had received a lymphoma treatment within one year (70%). With a median follow-up of 33 days from admission, 30-day overall survival was 71%, (95% confidence interval, 62-81%). In multivariable analysis, having an age &#8805; 70 years (hazard ratio 2·87, 1·20-6·85, p = 0·02) and relapsed/refractory lymphoma (hazard ratio 2·54, 1·14-5·66, p = 0·02) were associated with mortality. Recent bendamustine treatment (n = 9) was also pejorative (hazard ratio 3·20, 1·33-7·72, p = 0·01), but was strongly associated with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Remarkably, 30-day overall survival for patients < 70 years of age without relapsed/refractory lymphoma was 88% (78% - 99%). Interpretation: Thirty-day mortality was associated with being older and relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Survival of patients younger than 70 years without relapsed/refractory lymphoma was comparable to that of the general population.

Due to the lack of definitive etiological therapeutics currently, effective disease monitoring is of high clinical value for better healthcare and management of the large number of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 37 COVID-19 patients, collected 176 blood samples upon diagnosis and during treatment, and analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in these samples. We report gross abnormalities in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients, including elevated GC content, altered molecule size and end motif patterns. More importantly, such cfDNA characteristics reflect patient-specific physiological conditions during treatment. Further analysis on tissue origin tracing of cfDNA reveals frequent tissue injuries in COVID-19 patients, which is supported by clinical diagnoses. Hence, we demonstrate the translational merit of cfDNA as valuable analyte for effective disease monitoring, as well as tissue injury assessment in COVID-19 patients.","Jin, Xin; Wang, Yanqun; Xu, Jinjin; Li, Yimin; Cheng, Fanjun; Luo, Yuxue; Zhou, Haibo; Lin, Shanwen; Xiao, Fei; Zhang, Lu; Lin, Yu; Zhang, Zhaoyong; Jin, Yan; Zheng, Fang; Chen, Wei; Zhu, Airu; Tao, Ye; Zhao, Jingxian; Kuo, Tingyou; Li, Yuming; Li, Lingguo; Wen, Liyan; Ou, Rijing; Li, Fang; Lin, Long; Zhang, Yanjun; Sun, Jing; Yuan, Hao; Zhuang, Zhen; Sun, Haixi; Chen, Zhao; Li, Jie; Zhuo, Jianfen; Chen, Dongsheng; Zhang, Shengnan; Sun, Yuzhe; Wei, Peilan; Yuan, Jinwei; Xu, Tian; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Zhong, Nanshan; Xu, Yonghao; Sun, Kun; Zhao, Jincun",,,36

496224,ARIA-EAACI statement on severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines - an EAACI-ARIA position paper,2020,"Background: In Bogota; by August 1st, more than 27,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported, while complete and partial vaccination coverage reached 30% and 37%, respectively. Although reported cases are decreasing, the potential impact of new variants is uncertain. Methods: We used an agent-based model of COVID-19 calibrated to local data. Variants and vaccination strategies were included. We estimated the impact of vaccination and modelled scenarios of early and delayed introduction of the delta variant, along with changes in mobility, social contact, and vaccine uptake over the next months. Findings: By mid-July, vaccination may have prevented 17,800 (95% CrI: 16,000 - 19,000) deaths in Bogota. We found that delta could lead to a fourth wave of magnitude and timing dependent on social mixing, vaccination strategy, and delta dominance. In scenarios of early dominance of delta by mid-July, age prioritization and maintaining the interval between doses were important factors to avert deaths. However, if delta dominance occurred after mid-September, age prioritization would be less relevant, and the magnitude of a four wave would be smaller. In all scenarios, higher social mixing increased the magnitude of the fourth wave. Increasing vaccination rates from 50,000/day to 100,000/day reduced the impact of a fourth wave due to delta. Interpretation: The magnitude and timing of a potential fourth wave in Bogota; caused by delta would depend on social mixing and the timing of dominance. Rapidly increasing vaccination coverage with non-delayed second doses could reduce the burden of a new wave.","España, Guido; Cucunubá, Zulma M; Cuervo-Rojas, Juliana; Díaz, Hernando; González-Mayorga, Manuel; Ramírez, Juan David",,,36
496597,"Electrochemical Installation of CFH2 -, CF2 H-, CF3 -, and Perfluoroalkyl Groups into Small Organic Molecules",2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised many questions about the management of COPD patients and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognising and differentiating COVID-19 from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. It is unclear whether COPD patients are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should be used when essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. COPD patients should follow basic infection control measures including social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask or face covering. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches, as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung ventilation in patients with ARDS. Patients who develop mild COVID-19 should be followed as normal. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently than normally with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

The purpose of this research was to determine CL use, compliance and patient-practitioner communication during a 3-month long COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. METHODS: An online survey (developed using Google Forms) retrospectively evaluated CL compliance during the 3-month lockdown (responses captured between 15th July and 10th August, 2020), with particular emphasis on patient-practitioner communication, handwashing practices and CL case hygiene and replacement. RESULTS: A total of 247 responses were collected and analysed. Most participants used monthly replacement soft lenses (64.8 %) and multipurpose solutions (75.7 %), with 86.6 % of them owning a storage case for their lenses. During lockdown, a significant percentage of participants ceased lens wear (28.4 %) or reduced wearing time (49.2 %). Regarding patient-practitioner communication, 54.3 % of respondents received specific instructions, mostly about handwashing (93.3 %) and storage case hygiene (48.5 %). The most frequent non-compliant practices were inadequate handwashing (36.4 %), and overextending monthly or two-weekly replacement lenses (35.2 %). Many respondents never cleaned (23.0 %) nor replaced (16.3 %) their storage case, and 27.8 % of them reported not having been informed about case hygiene by their practitioners. CONCLUSION: Contact lens compliance, particularly in terms of handwashing and storage case hygiene, was poor during a prolonged COVID-19 lockdown, thus stressing the need to foster patient-practitioner communication strategies to curtail the possibility of ocular transmission and the risk of virus tropism.","Cardona, Genis; Alonso, Silvia; Busquets, Anna",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,,36

500226,A facile assay for rapid detection of COVID-19 antibodies,2020,"Pandemics have historically had a significant impact on economic inequality. However, official inequality statistics are only available at low frequency and with considerable delay, which challenges policymakers in their objective to mitigate inequality and fine-tune public policies. We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality. This information is fundamental to fine-tune public policies on the wake of a fast-moving pandemic like the COVID-19.","Aspachs, Oriol; Durante, Ruben; Graziano, Alberto; Mestres, Josep; Reynal-Querol, Marta; Montalvo, Jose G",PLoS One,,36

A paucity of data on PPE burn rate (PPE consumption over time) in pandemic situations exacerbated these issues as there was little historic research to indicate volumes of PPE required to care for surges in infective patients and thus plan procurement requirements. METHODS: To better understand PPE requirements for care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in our Australian quaternary referral hospital, the number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-h period for three patient groups (ward-based COVID suspect, ward-based COVID confirmed, intensive care COVID confirmed) was audited prospectively from 1st to 30th April 2020. RESULTS: The average number of staff-to-patient interactions in a 24-h period was: 13.1 ± 5.0 (mean ± SD) for stable ward-managed COVID-19 suspect patients; 11.9 ± 3.8 for stable ward-managed confirmed COVID-19 patients; and 30.0 ± 5.3 for stable, mechanically ventilated, ICU-managed COVID-19 patients. This data can be used in PPE demand simulation modelling for COVID-19 and potentially other respiratory illnesses. CONCLUSION: Data on the average number of staff-to-patient interactions needed for the care of COVID-19 patients is presented.

However, these studies comprised of an estimate rather than a broad analysis of exact numbers. In this study, we planned to investigate whether the pandemic really resulted in an increase in facial paralysis cases admitted to the hospital by evaluating the cases who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic year and in the previous 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis between March 2016-February 2017 (Group 1), between March 2017-February 2018 (Group 2), between March 2018-February 2019 (Group 3), between March 2019-February 2020 (Group 4), and between March 2020-February 2021 (Group 5) were investigated and detailed data were noted. RESULTS: 156, 164, 149, 172 and 157 patients were admitted to the hospital due to peripheral facial paralysis in Group 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Of these patients, 155, 164, 145, 169, and 153 were Bell's palsy, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive in only 2 of the 153 patients who were diagnosed in the year of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the number of peripheral facial paralysis detected during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to previous years. Very few number of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results may have been found incidentally in Bell's palsy patients. Theses stating that SARS-CoV-2 causes peripheral facial paralysis should be supported by laboratory studies and postmortem research.","Mutlu, Ahmet; Kalcioglu, Mahmut Tayyar; Gunduz, Ayse Yasemin; Bakici, Burcu; Yilmaz, Utku; Cag, Yasemin",Am J Otolaryngol,,36

501468,Hitting a moving target: The challenge of creating consensus treatment protocols for cardiovascular care during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Lippia javanica (lemon bush) is commonly used in the treatment of respiratory ailments, including asthma in southern African countries but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-asthmatic effects of L. javanica using a rat model of asthma. METHODS: A 5% w/v L. javanica tea infusion was prepared and characterised by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). Animals were intraperitoneally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and subsequently challenged intranasal with OVA on day 15 except the control group. Animals were grouped (n = 5/group) for treatment: unsensitised control, sensitised control, sensitised + prednisolone and sensitised + L. javanica at 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day - equivalent to 1 and 2 cups of tea per day, respectively. After 2 weeks of treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for total and differential white blood cell (WBC) count. Nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation and antioxidants were also assessed in BALF. Ovalbumin specific IgE antibody and inflammatory cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-alpha were measured in serum. Lung and muscle tissues were histological examined. RESULTS: L. javanica was rich in phenolic compounds. OVA sensitisation resulted in development of allergic asthma in rats. L. javanica treatment resulted in a reduction in total WBC count as well as eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils in BALF. L. javanica inhibited Th2-mediated immune response, which was evident by a decrease in serum IgE and inflammatory cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-&#945;. L. javanica treatment also reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO, and increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione and total antioxidant capacity. Histology showed significant attenuation of lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar thickening, and bronchiole smooth muscle thickening. CONCLUSION: L. javanica suppressed allergic airway inflammation by reducing Th2-mediated immune response and oxidative stress in OVA-sensitized rats which may be attributed to the presence of phenolic compound in the plant. This finding validates the traditional use of L. javanica in the treatment of respiratory disorders.","Mfengu, Mvuyisi O M; Shauli, Mathulo; Engwa, Godwill A; Musarurwa, Hannibal T; Sewani-Rusike, Constance R",BMC Complement Med Ther,,36

502684,It's time for global action to reinforce mother-infant skin-to-skin contact policy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to abrupt restrictions of life-space mobility. The impact of shelter-in-place orders on older adults' health and well-being is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with and without frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study based on structured telephone interviews. SETTING: Four geriatric outpatient clinics in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 557 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: The Life-Space Assessment was used to measure community mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a previously validated decrease of &#8805; 5 points defined restricted life-space mobility. Frailty was assessed through the FRAIL (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight) scale. The impact of shelter-in-place orders on QoL was evaluated with the question «How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your QoL?¼, to which participants could respond «not at all¼, «to some extent¼, or «to a great extent¼. We used ordinal logistic regressions to investigate the relationship between restricted life-space mobility and impact on QoL, adjusting our analyses for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, cognition, functionality, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. We explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on QoL. RESULTS: Participants were on average 80±8 years old, 65% were women, and 33% were frail. The COVID-19 quarantine led to a restriction of community mobility in 79% of participants and affected the QoL for 77% of participants. We found that restricted life-space mobility was associated with impact on QoL in older adults during the pandemic, although frailty modified the magnitude of the association (P-value for interaction=0.03). Frail participants who experienced restricted life-space mobility had twice the odds of reporting an impact on QoL when compared with non-frail individuals, with respective adjusted odds ratios of 4.20 (95% CI=2.36-7.50) and 2.18 (95% CI=1.33-3.58). CONCLUSION: Older adults experienced substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this unexpected change impacted their QoL. Providers should be particularly watchful for the consequences of abrupt life-space restrictions on frail individuals.","Saraiva, M D; Apolinario, D; Avelino-Silva, T J; de Assis Moura Tavares, C; Gattás-Vernaglia, I F; Marques Fernandes, C; Rabelo, L M; Tavares Fernandes Yamaguti, S; Karnakis, T; Kalil-Filho, R; Jacob-Filho, W; Romero Aliberti, M J",J Nutr Health Aging,,36
502777,Pregnancy and COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most destructive pandemic after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated lung infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models.

METHODS: 264 first responders were enrolled June-July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was defined as detection of IgG antibodies to both spike receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid in venous blood by validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We compared risk factors for being seropositive versus seronegative. RESULTS: 4%(11/264) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive.

Kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk for infectious diseases, including viral infections. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of population-wide infection control measures on the mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an electronic survey tool to collect demographic and sociocultural data. Additionally, in the same survey, we used 2 questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to measure mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. We also examined a control group and selected eligible participants according to age- and sex-based propensity score matching. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 308 participants: 154 kidney transplant recipients (mean age of 39.9 ± 10.6 years; 57.1% male) and 154 control participants (mean age of 39.1 ± 10.5; 57.1% male). With regard to the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, total scores and all subscale scores, excluding vigor, were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients than in the control group, a finding consistent with a better mood status. We found similar findings in anxiety and depression scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients seem to be resilient to the psychological stress induced by social distancing and lockdown periods.

Therefore, a sense of alarm over infection because of droplets that may be released during digestive endoscopy examination is increasing. This study aimed to investigate the droplets released during digestive endoscopy using a high-speed camera. METHODS: We utilized a high-speed camera (FASTCAM SA-3, Photron Limited) capable of recording small, transparent droplets with a black background and high-brightness lighting. The obtained video files were analyzed using post-processing software. We divided the 20 models into the control (a spray bottle model and a cough model) and experimental groups (digestive endoscopy models). The sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy and the amount of gas injected were modulated to change the level of released droplets. RESULTS: For the control groups, droplets were clearly observed using a high-speed camera. However, no droplet larger than 10 µm in size was observed in the experimental groups. Furthermore, the changes in the sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy, and amount of gas injected did not affect droplet formation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on high-speed camera photography, the risk of droplet generation during digestive endoscopy was not higher than that during violent expiratory events, such as coughing and sneezing.","Lee, Dong Seok; Jeong, Ji Bong; Kim, Ji Won; Lee, Kook Lae; Kim, Byeong Gwan; Kim, Su Hwan; Kang, Hyoun Woo",Surg Endosc,,36

509244,Assessing the future progression of COVID-19 in Iran and its neighbors using Bayesian models,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to reduce barriers to access physical therapy and associated care through the use of web-based programs and telehealth for those seeking treatment for low back pain (LBP). Despite this need, few studies have compared the effectiveness of clinic-based versus web-based or telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of clinic-based multidisciplinary therapy in an integrated practice unit (C-IPU) model with online integrated multidisciplinary therapy (O-IPU) in individuals undergoing conservative care for LBP. METHODS: A total of 1090 participants were prospectively recruited to participate in a clinical trial registry (NCT04081896) through the SpineZone rehabilitation IPU program. All participants provided informed consent. Participants were allocated to the C-IPU (N=988) or O-IPU (N=102) groups based on their personal preferences. The C-IPU program consisted of a high-intensity machine-based core muscle resistance training program, whereas the O-IPU program consisted of therapist-directed home core strengthening exercises through a web-based platform. Changes in LBP symptom severity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), goal achievement (Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and frequency of opioid use were compared between the C-IPU and O-IPU groups using multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age, gender, treatment number, program duration, and baseline pain and disability. RESULTS: Approximately 93.03% (1014/1090) of the participants completed their recommended programs, with no group differences in dropout rates (P=.78). The C-IPU group showed greater pain relief (P<.001) and reductions in disability (P=.002) than the O-IPU group, whereas the O-IPU group reported greater improvements in goal achievement (P<.001). Both programs resulted in reduced opioid use frequency, with 19.0% (188/988) and 21.5% (22/102) of participants reporting cessation of opioid use for C-IPU and O-IPU programs, respectively, leaving only 5.59% (61/1090) of participants reporting opioid use at the end of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both in-clinic and web-based multidisciplinary programs are beneficial in reducing pain, disability, and opioid use and in improving goal achievement. The differences between these self-selected groups shed light on patient characteristics, which require further investigation and could help clinicians optimize these programs.

509377,Addressing Bias in Responder Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes,2021,"Introduction Covid-19 is a recent outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). It affects mainly the lungs causing pneumonia and complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome. Computed tomography (CT) plays a key role in diagnosis, the most common findings are bilateral, peripheral and basal ground-glass opacities. Pneumothorax secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection is rare and seems to develop later in the course of the disease, its mechanism is not completely understood. There are several reports about Covid-19 and pneumothorax, but few descriptions associated with pulmonary cysts. We describe seven cases of pneumothorax in patients with Covid-19, some of them with pulmonary cysts. Case descriptions We found a series of seven patients with Covid-19 pneumonia with pneumothorax, some as the initial presentation and some developing after the course of the disease, two to three weeks after initial symptoms. Patients were male, most of them in their fifties, two were former smokers and two had COPD. Only one patient had mechanical ventilation, two of them had pulmonary cysts in the CT scan which were not documented before. A Multifocal upper lobe consolidations. B. 29 days later. Left upper-lobe subpleural cystic lesions, ground-glass opacities, right pneumothorax. Discussion The course of Covid-19 depends on the damage caused by the virus and the host's immune response. CT scan is of great value in diagnosis and monitoring of progression and complications. The most common patterns are ground-glass opacification (88%), peripheral distribution (76%), bilateral (87.5%) and multilobe involvement (78.8%). Pneumothorax or cysts in Covid-19 have been described in few case reports. Pneumothorax seems to occur after two weeks of symptom onset, predominantly in male patients. Liu et al. described a series of two men with pneumothorax and peripheral pulmonary cysts after 26 and 40 days of symptom onset;cysts decreased in number and size in subsequent images. Other reports have described cysts or bullae. Pneumothorax seems to develop later in the course of the disease and they are most likely related to the reparation process. Mechanical ventilation with positive pressure is not associated with all cases. The pathogenesis of pulmonary cysts formation in Covid-19 is not well understood. Proposed mechanisms of cystic lung disease include necrosis due to ischemia, remodeling of interstitial matrix, and bronchial obstruction with distal overinflation phenomenon. Information regarding mechanism of pneumothorax in patients with lung infection secondary to Covid-19 is not yet completely understood, but cysts formation may play a role.","Jimenez, L.

510704,COVID-19: Current Developments and Further Opportunities in Drug Delivery and Therapeutics,2020,"Objective: Severe or critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the rate of AKI in patients of different severities and independent predictive factors associated with AKI are not well understood. Patients and Methods: We enrolled 107 severely or critically ill elderly patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. AKI was defined according to the 2012 KDIGO criteria. We explored the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality using logistic regression. A predictive nomogram was formulated to predict the AKI development of patients with COVID-19 based on multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 107 elderly patients were enrolled during the study period. The mean age was 70 (64-78) years, and 69 (64.5%) were men. For the 107 patients, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as 37 patients with the severe type (34.6%) and 70 patients with the critical type (65.4%). Overall, 48 of the 107 patients (44.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, while AKI occurred in 7 (18.9%) out of the 37 severe patients and 41 (44.9%) out of the 70 critical patients. Of the AKI patients, 35.4% (17/48) required continuous renal replacement therapy, including 14.3% of AKI patients in severe cases and 39.0% of AKI patients in critical cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with AKI had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital mortality than severely and critically ill patients without AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that AKI (OR = 33.74; 95% CI = 3.34-341.29; P = 0.003), septic shock (OR = 15.58; 95% CI = 2.08-116.78; P = 0.008), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 18.44; 95% CI = 2.35-144.69; P = 0.006), and oxygenation index (OR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.98-1.000; P = 0.014) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. A nomogram was established based on the multivariate analysis results. The C-index for the developed AKI model was 0.935 (95% CI, 0.892-0.978); when 10-fold cross validation was used to validate the model, the corrected C-index was 0.825. Conclusion: AKI is common among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU and is recognized as a marker of disease severity. The proposed nomogram accurately predicted AKI development in ICU patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Therefore, the strategy for kidney protection against severe or critical pneumonia is appropriate.","Li, Qinglin; Zhang, Tianyi; Li, Fei; Mao, Zhi; Kang, Hongjun; Tao, Ling; Zhou, Feihu; Cai, Yue",Clin Interv Aging,,36

There is major divergence among nations, however, between a ""privacy-first"" approach which protects citizens' data at the cost of extremely limited access for public health authorities and researchers, and a ""data-first"" approach which stores large amounts of data which, while of immeasurable value to epidemiologists and other researchers, may significantly intrude upon citizens' privacy. The lack of a consensus on privacy protection in the contact tracing process creates risks of non-compliance or deliberate obfuscation from citizens who fear revealing private aspects of their lives - a factor greatly exacerbated by recent major scandals over online privacy and the illicit use of citizens' digital information, which have heightened public consciousness of these issues and created significant new challenges for any collection of large-scale public data. While digital contact tracing for COVID-19 remains in its infancy, the lack of consensus around best practices for its implementation and for reassuring citizens of the protection of their privacy may already have impeded its capacity to contribute to the pandemic response.","Fahey, Robert A; Hino, Airo",Int J Inf Manage,,36

Three haze stages were identified: the pre-pollution period (PPP), pollution accumulation period (PAP) and pollution dissipation period (PDP). The dominant source of PM2.5 in the PPP was biomass burning (BB) (40.4%), followed by secondary inorganic sources (28.1%) and motor vehicle exhaust (11.7%). The PAP was characterized by a large abundance of secondary inorganic sources, which contributed 56.1% of the total PM2.5 concentration, followed by BB (17.4%). The absorption Ångström exponent (2.2) in the PPP was higher than that in the other two periods. Analysis of fire spots monitored by remote satellite sensing indicated that open BB in regions around Nanning City could be one of the main factors. A planetary boundary layer-relative humidity-secondary particle matter-particulate matter positive feedback mechanism was employed to elucidate the atmospheric processes in this study. This study highlights the importance of understanding the role of BB, secondary inorganic sources and meteorology in air pollution formation and calls for policies for emission control strategies.","Mo, Zhaoyu; Huang, Jiongli; Chen, Zhiming; Zhou, Bin; Zhu, Kaixian; Liu, Huilin; Mu, Yijun; Zhang, Dabiao; Wang, Shanshan",Sci Rep,,36
512446,Insights from nanotechnology in COVID-19 treatment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Kidney graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may be at heightened risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this population and identify safe therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 73 adult kidney graft recipients evaluated for Covid-19 from 13 March to 20 April 2020. Primary outcomes included recovery from symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure and case fatality rate. RESULTS: Of the 73 patients screened, 54 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-39 with moderate to severe symptoms requiring hospital admission and 15 with mild symptoms managed in the ambulatory setting. Hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity and to have cardiovascular disease. In the hospitalized group, tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of patients and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy was stopped in 61% of patients. None of the ambulatory patients had tacrolimus reduction or discontinuation of MMF. Azithromycin or doxycycline was prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and ambulatory patients (38% versus 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%) and 7 patients died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 13% among Covid-19-positive patients and 18% among hospitalized Covid-19-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from our study suggest that a strategy of systematic triage to outpatient or inpatient care, early management of concurrent bacterial infections and judicious adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is feasible in kidney transplant recipients with Covid-19.","Lubetzky, Michelle; Aull, Meredith J; Craig-Schapiro, Rebecca; Lee, John R; Marku-Podvorica, Jehona; Salinas, Thalia; Gingras, Laura; Lee, Jun B; Sultan, Samuel; Kodiyanplakkal, Rosy Priya; Hartono, Choli; Saal, Stuart; Muthukumar, Thangamani; Kapur, Sandip; Suthanthiran, Manikkam; Dadhania, Darshana M",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,36

The Western Cape (WC) province was the initial epicenter. The pandemic peaked in July 2020 when 76,851 cases were documented and 2,323 deaths reported. COVID-19 can have multisystem involvement. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is well-documented and associated with increased mortality. We report our experience as the pandemic evolved in the WC province, focusing on those patients with a SARS-CoV-2 positive test presenting with AKI. We also reviewed our chronic dialysis cohort and renal transplant recipients who tested positive to assess incidence and outcomes. All patients presenting to nephrology services at the four main public hospitals were included. Information regarding demographics, co-morbidities, medical care, laboratory data, and outcomes were recorded. There were 86 patients referred with AKI, 48 required dialysis, and 47 died. There were 52 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with AKI (37 received dialysis, 1 of whom survived). In those presenting with AKI, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and HIV were the most common comorbidities. Of the 295 patients receiving chronic dialysis within our services, 31 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 6 died. Of the 45 kidney transplant recipients who tested positive, 9 died. Only 3 required dialysis. In conclusion, we report a high rate of AKI and poor prognosis in those requiring kidney replacement therapy, a better prognosis than anticipated was found in our chronic dialysis cohort, and high numbers of admissions were required for renal transplant recipients.","Jones, Erika S W; Davidson, Bianca J; Barday, Zibya; Barday, Zunaid; Davids, M Razeen; Thomson, David; Day, Christel Arnold; Hussey, Hannah; Vermeulen, Alda; Chothia, Mogamat-Yazied; Nel, Johan; Wearne, Nicola",Clin Nephrol,,36

Preoperative PTC plasma miRNA expression (n = 49) was compared with plasma miRNA in the HC group (n = 57) and patients with NG (n = 23). It was demonstrated that miR-221; miR-222; miR-146b; miR-21 and miR-181b were overexpressed in preoperative PTC plasma samples compared to HC (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.002; respectively). The upregulation in tumor tissue of these miRNAs was consistent with The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Carcinoma dataset. A significant decrease in miR-21; miR-221; miR-146b and miR-181b expression was observed in the plasma of PTC patients after total thyroidectomy (p = 0.004; p = 0.001; p = 0.03; p = 0.036; respectively). The levels of miR-222 were significantly higher in the preoperative PTC compared to the NG group (p = 0.004). ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis revealed miR-222 as a potential marker in distinguishing PTC from NG (AUC 0.711; p = 0.004).

In the summer semester 2020, the concept for the 4th preclinical semester included a practical training on ""sharing information"", which consisted of three two-hour face-to-face sessions with simulated patients (SP). Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, teaching was changed to an inverted classroom concept combining asynchronous and synchronous teaching. The students worked at the beginning of the semester on an e-learning module of the learning platform docCom.deutsch on the topic ""sharing information"" using reflection and processing tasks. In two digital sessions, the students then were able to practice discharge interviews and discussions about risk communication illustrated by the example of screening methods for cancer prevention. In the first zoom session, students practiced in role-plays among themselves. In the second zoom session, they practiced with SP. The evaluation results revealed that 76% of the responding students considered working with the e-learning module as a good preparation for the interviews. According to the evaluation results, satisfaction with the Zoom meeting including SP contact was slightly higher than those with role-plays among themselves. Although the group atmosphere was rated by all responding students as conducive to learning, almost half of them confirmed that using Zoom significantly impaired the atmosphere (47%). In retrospect, the conversion of the communication training to a digital format worked better than expected from both the perspective of teachers and students.

519182,Understanding of COVID-19 Pathology: Much More Attention to Plasma Proteins,2021,"Paper-based sensors, microfluidic platforms, and electronics have attracted attention in the past couple of decades because they are flexible, can be recycled easily, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive. Here we report a paper-based potentiometric sensor to detect the whole Zika virus with a minimum sensitivity of 0.26 nV/Zika and a minimum detectable signal (MDS) of 2.4x107 Zika. Our paper sensor works very similar to a P-N junction where a junction is formed between two different regions with different electrochemical potentials on the paper. These two regions with slightly different ionic contents, ionic species and concentrations, produce a potential difference given by the Nernst equation. Our paper sensor consists of 2-3 mm x 10 mm segments of paper with conducting silver paint contact patches on two ends. The paper is dipped in a buffer solution containing aptamers designed to bind to the capsid proteins on Zika. We then added the Zika (in its own buffer) to the region close to one of the silver-paint contacts. The Zika virus (40 nm diameter with 43 kDa or 7.1x10-20 gm weight) became immobilized in the paper's pores and bonded with the resident aptamers creating a concentration gradient. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were carried out to verify that both the aptamer and Zika become immobilized in the paper. The potential measured between the two silver paint contacts reproducibly became more negative upon adding the Zika. We also showed that a Liquid Crystalline Display (LCD) powered by the sensor can be used to read the sensor output.","Dolai, Subhashish; Tabib-Azar, Massood",Med Devices Sens,,36

520063,Evaluation of the Implementation of FDG-PET/CT and Staging Laparoscopy for Gastric Cancer in The Netherlands,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of human lives including health, businesses, and lifestyles. In spite of governments implementing various strategies across the globe, the pandemic is still expanding with increasing numbers of positive cases. In addition, countries are reopening and easing lockdown restrictions in order to get their economies back on track, and this has led to an increase in the transmission of novel coronavirus. Therefore, it is essential to regularly review the containment strategies employed in different regions in order to understand the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and to formulate a future course of actions. Objective: The objective of this study is to review the COVID-19 transmission statistics in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and European Union (EU) countries, and to compare these data with the various containment strategies implemented for containing the spread of the virus. Methods: A review method was adopted along with different statistical methods for comparing and analyzing COVID-19 data and containment strategies. Transmission types and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the countries in both regions are used to present the current state of the pandemic. In addition, changes in the number of COVID-19 cases are compared with the mitigation and suppression strategies implemented in both regions and their impact is analyzed. Results: Countries in the EU were slow in reacting to the pandemic, as delays are observed in the implementation of mitigation strategies. However, suppression strategies were implemented soon after mitigation strategies. GCC countries, on the other hand, were quick to react, and they implemented both mitigation and suppression strategies simultaneously, as soon as the pandemic emerged. The CFR was found to be low among GCC countries compared to EU countries. In addition, a second wave of transmission was observed in the EU, whereas in GCC countries there has been no second wave, although a gradual increase in the number of cases is observed. Community transmission was observed among the majority of countries in both GCC and EU countries. Conclusions: With the reopening of markets, the focus of governments should be on developing integrated user-centric preventive strategies, with a blend of awareness creation, motivation, and support.","Alanezi, Fahad; Althumairi, Arwa; Aljaffary, Afnan; Alfayez, Asma; Alsalman, Demah; Alhodaib, Hala; AlShammari, Maha M; Aldossary, Reem; AlThani, Bashair; Alghamedy, Fatemah; Alanzi, Turki M",Inform Med Unlocked,,36

This study aims to identify the determinants of survival and the outcome within 30 days in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection in Upper Egypt. Patients and methods A total of 1064 cases were consecutively admitted to isolation hospitals in Upper Egypt. All cases had confirmed COVID-19 infection. The electronic records of the patients were retrospectively revised and the demographic data, clinical manifestations, quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score on admission, and 30-day outcome (ICU admission, death, recovery, or still in hospital) were analyzed. Overall cumulative survival rates in all patients and those more than or less than 50 years were calculated. Results Overall, 49.2% of the study population were males, whereas 50.8% were females, with mean age of 49.4±17.8 years. On admission, 83.9% were stable with qSOFA score less than 1, 3% required noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 2.1% required O2 therapy. Within 30 days, 203 (19.1%) cases required admission to ICU. Death was recorded in 11.7% of cases, 28.7% recovered, and 59.7% were still under treatment. Determinants of ICU admission and survival in the current study were age more than 50 years, qSOFA more than 1, and need for O2 therapy or noninvasive ventilation. The cumulative survival was 75.3%, with the mean survival of 28.1, and 95.2% overall survival rate was recorded in those aged less than or equal to 50 years. Conclusions Age older than 50 years old, those with preexisting diabetes mellitus, initial qSOFA score, requirement for O2 therapy, and noninvasive ventilation from the first day of hospital admission may be associated with unfavorable 30-day in-hospital outcome of COVID-19.","Hussein, A.

Hence, the classical epidemic SIR and SEIRD models inspired by the epidemic's outbreak are widely used to predict the evolution of the disease. In addition to classical approaches, describing complex phenomena through Cellular Automata (CA) is a highly effective way to understand the iterations on a populated system. The present research analyzed the usage of CA to generate an epidemic-computational model from a micro perspective based on parameters obtained through a statistical fit from a macro perspective. After validating SIR and SEIRD models with the government official data for Brasilia, Brazil, the authors applied the obtained parameters to the Cellular Automata model. The CA model simulated the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected people in a restrained environment (i.e., a supermarket) under several varied conditions applying an approach never adopted before. The manner of applying CA in this research proved to represent an essential tool in predicting the spread of the coronavirus in confined spaces with random movements of people. The CA numerical open-source presented has the purpose of clarifying how the spread occurs not only as a mathematical curve but in an organic way. The numerical simulations from the CA model allowed the authors to conclude that markets and stores are relevant places where might be infections. Thus, every local store and the market owner should reason about the aspects that could avoid the spread of the disease, coming up with efficient solutions. Each environment has specific features that only those who know them are the ones capable of managing.","Cavalcante, André Luís Brasil; Borges, Lucas Parreira de Faria; Lemos, Moisés Antônio da Costa; Farias, Márcio Muniz de; Carvalho, Hervaldo Sampaio",Comput Biol Chem,,36

The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for an interleukin-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. RESULTS: Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and nonsurvivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin, and LDH could help the clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients. However, this data needs to be further validated in a larger population.","Fei, Fei; Smith, John A; Cao, Liyun",J. med. virol,,36
524277,Race to arsenal COVID-19 therapeutics: Current alarming status and future directions,2020,"The diagnosis and management of COVID-19 are much dependent on the adherence to standardized protocols. Healthcare workers play a crucial role in the case management of COVID-19 in many institutions. Globally, the disease burden is increasing, and the mortality has reached over 2 041 426 compared with 323 000 in May 2020. In West Africa, the pandemic has shown a slow but steady rise in many countries. Existing protocols and their utilization are best assessed after the occurrence of the index case. General aim. The study assessed the health worker's response to COVID-19 protocols at three designated areas of the in-hospital management care triaging, holding area, and treatment centers. Method. A qualitative design was used to assess the response of healthcare workers with regards to early case detection, infection prevention, risk communication to clients and compliance to protocols. The study conducted observational visits and purposively selected healthcare workers comprising of clinicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and laboratory technicians who perform routine duties at the triaging, holding, and treatment centers. A total of 41 observations were made over two weeks. Results. Participants comprised 23 males and 18 females. At all observed units, the case definition was being used to screen attendants presenting, and appropriate categorization of patients was ensured. The use of temperature in screening for COVID-19 at the units was generally adhered to. Only 50% of participants used the prescribed PPEs. The physical distancing between healthcare workers and client and between clients and caregivers were not enforced; however, hand hygiene was practiced. Disinfection of working surfaces and equipment with 0.5% chlorine or 70% alcohol-based rubs were used most of the time. It was observed however that no psychological counselling was given to suspected cases or their relatives. Conclusion. Healthcare workers showed discordant response to different parts of the protocols for COVID-19 especially appropriate distancing. There was an enhanced awareness among healthcare workers and improvement in infection prevention protocols. The study also observed that as the risk of infection increased from triaging to holding area and to treatment centers, the response of healthcare workers to COVID-19 protocols also improved. Risk communication is an essential part of the COVID-19 management strategy. At the treatment centers, healthcare workers adhered to this protocol, whereas it was a major gap at the triaging and holding areas.","Afeng-Nkansah, D; Asumanu, E; Nyinaku, P; Acheampong, F; Lamptey, R",Biomed Res Int,,36

We compared the infection and mortality rates in relation to COVID-19 between countries with and without universal respiratory disease vaccine policies. METHODS: In this ecological study, 186 countries with COVID-19 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. RESULTS: The study found that countries with universal BCG (bacillus Calmette Guérin) vaccine had significantly lower total infection and mortality rates, 0.2979 and 0.0077 versus 3.7445, and 0.0957/1000 people and confirmed cases (P < 0.001). The countries with universal pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), including PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3 vaccines, had significantly higher total mortality, 0.0111 versus 0.0080, respectively (P = 0.032). Higher income was associated with increasing total infection and mortality rates. Whereas, BCG vaccination was associated with a lower total mortality rate only (P = 0.030). The high-income countries were more likely to not receive universal BCG and receive second dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV2) and third dose of PCV3 vaccination coverage. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates increased with increasing years of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (P = 0.026) and pneumococcal conjugate third dose (PCV3). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that BCG vaccination could reduce the infection caused by COVID-19, and MCV2 vaccine years increases the total infection rate. This study identified high economic characteristics and not having universal BCG coverage as the independent risk factors of mortality by multivariate analysis.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, Alan Bapeer",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588980/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.47,36
592033,Assessing and addressing collider bias in addiction research: the curious case of smoking and COVID‐19,2020-11-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles released by all cell types, differing in biogenesis, physical characteristics, and contents. Due to their central role in intercellular communication and their variable cargo, EVs are involved in several biological processes. The possibility of isolating them from different biofluids makes EVs valuable biomarkers to be analyzed for the diagnosis or prognosis of several conditions. Moreover, these natural nanoparticles have been investigated as therapeutic tools in many pathological conditions. In this context, EVs have shown innate immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties when isolated from stem/progenitor cells and have also been considered vehicles to be edited for drug delivery. The aim of the review is to report some of the pre-clinical and clinical studies distinguishing those in which EVs have been examined as biomarkers from those in which they have been used as therapeutics. ABSTRACT: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are ubiquitous masters of intercellular communication, being detectable in tissues, circulation, and body fluids. Their complex cargo reflects the (patho)physiologic status of the cells from which they originate. Due to these properties, the potential of EVs, and in particular exosomes, to serve as biomarkers or therapeutics has grown exponentially over the past decade. On one side, numerous studies have demonstrated that EV-associated nucleic acids and proteins are implicated in cancer progression, as well as neurodegenerative, infectious, and autoimmune disorders. On the other, the therapeutic use of EVs secreted by various cell types, and in particular stem/progenitor cells, present significant advantages in comparison to the corresponding parental cells, such as the less complex production and storage conditions. In this review, we examine some of the major pre-clinical studies dealing with EVs and exosomes, that led to the development of numerous completed clinical trials.","Ciferri, Maria Chiara; Quarto, Rodolfo; Tasso, Roberta",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922446/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10050359,36

Here, we investigated the interaction of this new coronavirus with Vero cells using high resolution scanning electron microscopy. Surface morphology, the interior of infected cells and the distribution of viral particles in both environments were observed 2 and 48 hours after infection. We showed areas of viral processing, details of vacuole contents, and viral interactions with the cell surface. Intercellular connections were also approached, and viral particles were adhered to these extensions suggesting direct cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Highlights We used high resolution scanning electron microscopy to investigate Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 2 and 48 hours post-infection. The central conclusions of this work include: Infected cells display polarization of their cytosol forming a restricted viroplasm-like zone dedicated to virus production and morphogenesis. This is the first demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 attachment by scanning electron microscopy.

592977,Development and Validation of a Predictive Model of Success in Bariatric Surgery,2020-11-14,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak requires a permanent adaptation of practices. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also involved and we evaluated these changes in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHODS: OHCA of medical origins identified from the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry between March 1st and April 31st 2020 (COVID-19 period), were analysed. Different resuscitation characteristics were compared with the same period from the previous year (non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: Overall, 1005 OHCA during the COVID-19 period and 1620 during the non-COVID-19 period were compared. During the COVID-19 period, bystanders and first aid providers initiated CPR less frequently (49.8% versus 54.9%; difference, − 5.1 percentage points [95% CI, − 9.1 to − 1.2]; and 84.3% vs. 88.7%; difference, − 4.4 percentage points [95% CI, − 7.1 to − 1.6]; respectively) as did mobile medical teams (67.3% vs. 75.0%; difference, − 7.7 percentage points [95% CI, − 11.3 to − 4.1]). First aid providers used defibrillators less often (66.0% vs. 74.1%; difference, − 8.2 percentage points [95% CI, − 11.8 to − 4.6]). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and D30 survival were lower during the COVID-19 period (19.5% vs. 25.3%; difference, − 5.8 percentage points [95% CI, − 9.0 to − 2.5]; and 2.8% vs. 6.4%; difference, − 3.6 percentage points [95% CI, − 5.2 to − 1.9]; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 period, we observed a decrease in CPR initiation regardless of whether patients were suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection or not. In the current atmosphere, it is important to communicate good resuscitation practices to avoid drastic and lasting reductions in survival rates after an OHCA.","Baert, Valentine; Jaeger, Deborah; Hubert, Hervé; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Debaty, Guillaume; Chouihed, Tahar; Javaudin, François",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339538/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-020-00813-x,36

The mechanism of action for quicklime is the resulting exothermic reaction that occurs when the chemical interacts with water and its ability to increase pH levels. These treatments may also reduce pathogens in a commercial poultry house. In this study, a steam sterilization cart simulated conditions used by the nursery industry to treat litter inoculated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A homogenized sample of litter was exposed to steam for 0, 5, 30, or 120 min. Quicklime was used at concentrations of 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0%. All steam treatments, with or without quicklime, significantly reduced Salmonella Typhimurium colonization by at least 3 orders of magnitude. Significant reductions were also observed in the treatments with quicklime alone. Both the steam and the quicklime treatments often reduced colonization to undetectable levels, even when samples were enriched. Therefore, we demonstrated 2 novel techniques for reducing Salmonella Typhimurium in poultry litter. Soil pasteurization potentially offers an environmentally sound means of reducing the pathogens present in used poultry litter.","Stringfellow, K.; Caldwell, D.; Lee, J.; Byrd, A.; Carey, J.; Kessler, K.; McReynolds, J.; Bell, A.; Stipanovic, R.; Farnell, M.",J Appl Poult Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1056617119312395; https://doi.org/10.3382/japr.2009-00097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056617119312395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336902/,36

To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are underway to test possible therapies. During this urgency situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication apparatus has indicated highest potential towards antiviral drug discovery. In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach led to the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak.","Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Froeyen, Matheus",J Pharm Anal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177920303865?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095177920303865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346490/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.04.008,36
593253,Mucin signature as a potential tool to predict susceptibility to COVID‐19,2020-12-29,"Schizophrenia is a disorder with a heterogeneous etiology involving complex interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. The immune system is now known to play vital roles in nervous system function and pathology through regulating neuronal and glial development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. In this regard, the immune system is positioned as a common link between the seemingly diverse genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Synthesizing information about how the immune-brain axis is affected by multiple factors and how these factors might interact in schizophrenia is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Such knowledge will aid in the development of more translatable animal models that may lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that modulate immune function. We also explore environmental factors for schizophrenia including exposure to pollution, gut dysbiosis, maternal immune activation and early-life stress, and how the consequences of these risk factors are linked to microglial function and dysfunction. We also propose that morphological and signaling deficits of the blood-brain barrier, as observed in some individuals with schizophrenia, can act as a gateway between peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, thus affecting microglia in their essential functions. Finally, we describe the diverse roles that microglia play in response to neuroinflammation and their impact on brain development and homeostasis, as well as schizophrenia pathophysiology.","Comer, Ashley L.; Carrier, Micaël; Tremblay, Marie-Ève; Cruz-Martín, Alberto",Front Cell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061891/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00274,36

T cell-induced immune responses during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have rarely been reported. METHODS: We use cell counting chips and PCR arrays to offer the first insights into the T cell involved in the course of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. All consecutive patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at the designated hospital between January 2020 and February 2020 were recruited for the study, and cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Baseline characteristics for inpatients were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 96 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in our center were screened for inclusion in the study. The median age of the patients was 39.0 years, and 47 (49.0%) were female. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the CD4+ cell counts were significantly lower in the infection group and slightly higher in the control group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed good discrimination power between subjects with and subjects without infection. LIMITATIONS: This is a single-center study of patients with a specific ethnic background and lacks a mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply the importance of CD4+ T cells (but not CD8+ and CD3+ T cells) in SARS-CoV-2 infection associated pneumonia and indicate that CD4+ T cells might be important for the control of SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Zhixin; Li, Wenli; Lu, Eying; Yan, Xiukui; Lin, Jianguo; Zhuo, Li",J Affect Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720326422?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720326422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861838/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.037,36
593409,Reaching Absent and Refusing Individuals During Home-Based HIV Testing Through Self-Testing—at What Cost?,2021-06-29,"With the overnight growth in Working from Home (WFH) owing to the pandemic, organisations and their employees have had to adapt work-related processes and practices quickly with a huge reliance upon technology. Everyday activities such as social interactions with colleagues must therefore be reconsidered. Existing literature emphasises that social interactions, typically conducted in the traditional workplace, are a fundamental feature of social life and shape employees’ experience of work. This experience is completely removed for many employees due to the pandemic and, presently, there is a lack of knowledge on how individuals maintain social interactions with colleagues via technology when working from home. Given that a lack of social interaction can lead to social isolation and other negative repercussions, this study aims to contribute to the existing body of literature on remote working by highlighting employees’ experiences and practices around social interaction with colleagues. This study takes an interpretivist and qualitative approach utilising the diary-keeping technique to collect data from twenty-nine individuals who had started to work from home on a full-time basis as a result of the pandemic. The study explores how participants conduct social interactions using different technology platforms and how such interactions are embedded in their working lives. The findings highlight the difficulty in maintaining social interactions via technology such as the absence of cues and emotional intelligence, as well as highlighting numerous other factors such as job uncertainty, increased workloads and heavy usage of technology that affect their work lives. The study also highlights that despite the negative experiences relating to working from home, some participants are apprehensive about returning to work in the traditional office place where social interactions may actually be perceived as a distraction. The main contribution of our study is to highlight that a variety of perceptions and feelings of how work has changed via an increased use of digital media while working from home exists and that organisations need to be aware of these differences so that they can be managed in a contextualised manner, thus increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of working from home.","Lal, Banita; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Haag, Markus",Inf Syst Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483713/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10182-0,36

Cell culture media is an intricate mixture of numerous chemical constituents and cells that collectively produce complicated mass spectra. Cholesterol and free fatty acids were identified and attributed to lipid sources in the media (blood serum supplement and plasma membranes of host cells). These lipid moieties could be utilized as signature markers for rapidly detecting the cell culture media. Viruses are intracellular parasites and are dependent upon host cells in order to exist. Therefore, it is highly probable that significant quantities of media needed to grow and maintain viable host cells would be present if a viral agent were disseminated as an aerosol into the environment.

This new medical model has benefited integrative oncology (IO) consultations, where cancer patients are counseled about healthy lifestyle, non-pharmacological approaches for symptom management, and addressing questions around natural products and other integrative modalities. Here we report the feasibility of conducting IO physician consultations via telehealth in 2020 and compare patient characteristics to prior in-person consultations conducted in 2019. METHODS: An integrated EHR-telemedicine platform was used for IO physician consultations. As in the prior in-person visits, patients completed pre-visit patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments about common cancer symptoms [modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, (ESAS)], Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW), and the PROMIS-10 to assess quality of life (QOL). Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and PROs for new telehealth consultation in 2020 were compared to new in-person consultations in 2019 using t-tests, chi-squared tests, and -Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: We provided telehealth IO consultations to 509 new patients from April 21, 2020, to October 21, 2020, versus 842 new patients in-person during the same period in 2019. Most were female (77 % vs 73%); median age (56 vs 58), and the most frequent cancer type was breast (48% vs 39%). More patients were seeking counseling on herbs and supplements (12.9 vs 6.8%) and lifestyle (diet 22.7 vs 16.9% and exercise 5.2 vs 1.8%) in the 2020 cohort than 2019, respectively. The 2020 telehealth cohort had lower symptom management concerns compared to the 2019 in-person cohort (19.5 vs 33.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Delivering IO consultations using telehealth is feasible and meets patients’ needs.

595466,"SARS, MERS and COVID-19—new threats; old lessons",2020-05-03,"The airway epithelial barrier is a major barrier protecting against clinically significant infections of the lung. Its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes, biofilm formation, and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes. Enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interferon-λ (IFN-λ), members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. These cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor IL-10RB, have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense. They are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections, but with differing kinetics. IL-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides, upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17. Conversely, IFN-λ, a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties, appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation. The effects of these cytokines are pleotropic, with pathogen and tissue specific consequences. Understanding how these cytokines work in the mucosal defenses of the respiratory system may suggest potential targets to prevent invasive infections of the damaged lung.","Ahn, Danielle; Prince, Alice",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637365/,36

Patients with COPD are frequently excluded from clinical trials of treatments aimed at reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality, which has led to undertreatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD. A particular concern in COPD is the underuse of beta (β)-blockers. There is observational evidence that cardioselective β-blockers are safe and may even reduce mortality risk in COPD, although some evidence is conflicting. There is an urgent need to answer the research question: Are cardioselective β-blockers safe and of benefit in people with moderately severe COPD? The proposed study will investigate whether cardioselective β-blocker treatment in patients with COPD reduces mortality and cardiac and respiratory morbidity. METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial to be conducted in approximately 26 sites in Australia, New Zealand, India, Sri Lanka and other countries as required. Participants with COPD will be randomised to either bisoprolol once daily (range 1.25–5 mg, dependent on tolerated dose) or matched placebo, in addition to receiving usual care for their COPD over the study duration of 24 months. The study will enrol 1164 participants with moderate to severe COPD, aged 40–85 years. Participants will be symptomatic from their COPD and have a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) ≥30% and ≤70% predicted and a history of at least one exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both in the prior 24 months.

In order to establish infection, inhaled conidia must germinate, whereby they break dormancy, start to swell, and initiate a highly polarized growth process. To identify critical biological processes during germination, we performed a cross-platform, cross-species comparative analysis of germinating A. fumigatus and A. niger conidia using transcriptional data from published RNA-Seq and Affymetrix studies. A consensus co-expression network analysis identified four gene modules associated with stages of germination. These modules showed numerous shared biological processes between A. niger and A. fumigatus during conidial germination. Specifically, the turquoise module was enriched with secondary metabolism, the black module was highly enriched with protein synthesis, the darkgreen module was enriched with protein fate, and the blue module was highly enriched with polarized growth. More specifically, enriched functional categories identified in the blue module were vesicle formation, vesicular transport, tubulin dependent transport, actin-dependent transport, exocytosis, and endocytosis. Genes important for these biological processes showed similar expression patterns in A. fumigatus and A. niger, therefore, they could be potential antifungal targets. Through cross-platform, cross-species comparative analysis, we were able to identify biologically meaningful modules shared by A. fumigatus and A. niger, which underscores the potential of this approach.","Baltussen, Tim J.

Nevertheless, there are currently more than 1000 ongoing clinical trials focusing on the use and effectiveness of antiviral drugs as a possible therapeutic treatment. Among the classes of antiviral drugs are included 3CL protein inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors and other small molecule drugs which target the ability of SARS-COV-2 to interact with host cells.

Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant primitive germ cell tumor in young women, known for its curability and low propensity to invade and metastasize when diagnosed early. Herein, we report an unusual type of ovarian dysgerminoma (OD) metastasis with a brief review of the literature, lacking similar reported cases. To our knowledge, although there are several case reports of dysgerminoma metastases with variable anatomic location and presentation, vaginal metastasis has not been previously described. The local or systemic relapse together with local and distant metastasis is considered as an independent predictor of poor survival in patients with OD. In light of the absence of mutations status, our patient successfully responded to therapy. Currently, the patient remains in clinical remission. A specific follow-up plan is ongoing knowing that ovarian dysgerminomas tend to recur most often in the first 2–3 years after treatment.","Tîrnovanu, Mihaela Camelia; Florea, Irina Daniela; Tănase, Adina; Toma, Bogdan Florin; Cojocaru, Elena; Ungureanu, Carmen; Lozneanu, Ludmila",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071828/,36

Migraine is one of the commonest and highly disabling chronic neurological diseases in the world. During the pandemic and lockdown, migraine patients are facing an enormous problem in getting optimum care because of difficulty in access, forced social isolation, and encountering a health system that is getting rapidly overwhelmed. It is important that they must be protected by minimizing their visits to the clinics and emergency departments. Paradoxically multiple triggers are in operation which is likely to increase their headache frequency. Hence physicians should be made aware of the new rules of the game in treating migraines during this time of the pandemic so that these patients get optimum treatment and care and don’t feel left out.

METHODS: The medical and billing records of a large academic private practice were electronically queried for all cases of PPV for retinal detachment performed between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The preoperative consultation, operative report, and POD1 and POW1 (postoperative days 5-14) visits were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of unexpected management changes (change in or extended positioning, additional procedure, change in drop regimen, or shortened interval follow-up) at the POD1 visit after uncomplicated PPV for retinal detachment. RESULTS: Overall, 418 surgeries from 364 eyes and 355 patients were included. Eleven cases (2.6%) had an intraocular pressure (IOP) over 30 mmHg at POD1. IOP lowering drops were prescribed for 30 cases (7.2%). Silicone oil tamponade was positively associated with high IOP at POD1 (RR = 3.23, 95% CI 0.96 –10.84, P = 0.06). No additional management changes were made besides treating elevated IOP. CONCLUSIONS: Management changes POD1 after vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair are relatively uncommon and were solely IOP related in this patient group. There may be flexibility regarding the type of POD1 encounter necessary, including an IOP check with an ophthalmic technician or non-retinal eye care provider. Larger, prospective studies are needed to better determine the most efficient follow-up routine.","Patel, Dillan; Borkar, Durga S.; Madhava, Malika; Obeid, Anthony; Mellen, Phoebe L.; Regillo, Carl D.; Garg, Sunir J.",Am J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.09.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939420305328?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939420305328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002487/,36

The prevalence of peanut allergy increased 3.5-fold over the past two decades reaching 1.4–2% in Europe and the United States. The reasons for this increase in prevalence are likely multifaceted. Sensitization via the skin appears to be associated with the development of peanut allergy and atopic eczema in infancy is associated with a high risk of developing peanut allergy. Until recently, the only possible management strategy for peanut allergy was strict allergen avoidance and emergency treatment including adrenaline auto-injector in cases of accidental exposure and reaction.

Methods: A total of 487 infants were recruited at birth for the Asthma Multicenter Infant Cohort Study in Barcelona (Spain). Cases of LRTIs were ascertained through an active register including a home visit and viral test in nasal lavage specimens during the first year of life. Cotinine in cord blood, household aeroallergens, indoor NO(2) and maternal and neonatal IgE were measured. Other maternal and infants' characteristics were obtained from structured questionnaires. Results: The incidence rate of at least one LRTI was 38.7 infants per 100 persons‐years. The most frequently isolated viral agent was respiratory syncytial virus (44.7%). The risk of LRTIs was higher in infants with a maternal history of asthma and in those with siblings (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 0.98–6.08 and OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.04–3.21, respectively).

600179,Radiation Oncology in times of COVID-2019: A review article for those in the eye of the storm – An Indian Perspective,2020-07-13,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic of unprecedented severity affecting millions of people around the world and causing several hundred thousands of deaths. The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective. Considering these promising experimental data, we hypothesize that PHD inhibitors could be considered as a possible new therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Del Vecchio, Lucia; Locatelli, Francesco",Clin Kidney J,https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfaa149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905208/,36

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: East London Pancreatic Cancer Epidemiology (EL-PaC-Epidem) Study at Barts Health National Health Service Trust, UK. Linked electronic health records were interrogated on a cohort of participants (age ≥18 years), reported with HPB conditions between 1 April 2008 and 6 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: EL-PaC-Epidem Study participants, alive on 12 February 2020, and living in East London within the previous 6 months (n=15 440). The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7% belonging to the non-White background. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 incidence and mortality. RESULTS: Some 226 (1.5%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age >70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people.","Dayem Ullah, Abu Z M; Sivapalan, Lavanya; Kocher, Hemant M; Chelala, Claude",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875444/,36

601822,Pharmacotherapy in COVID 19: Potential Impact of Targeting the Complement System,2020-12-24,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes direct lung damage, overwhelming endothelial activation, and inflammatory reaction, leading to acute respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating targeted therapies to hinder this exaggerated inflammatory response. Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have shown heterogeneous severity trajectories, suggesting that response to therapies is likely to vary across patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are critically ill COVID-19 patients biologically and immunologically dissociable based on profiling of currently evaluated therapeutic targets? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We did a single-center, prospective study in an ICU department in France. Ninety-six critically ill adult patients admitted with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. We conducted principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering on a vast array of immunologic variables measured on the day of ICU admission. RESULTS: We found that patients were distributed in three clusters bearing distinct immunologic features and associated with different ICU outcomes. Cluster 1 had a “humoral immunodeficiency” phenotype with predominant B-lymphocyte defect, relative hypogammaglobulinemia, and moderate inflammation. Cluster 2 had a “hyperinflammatory” phenotype, with high cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF⍺]) associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte defects. Cluster 3 had a “complement-dependent” phenotype with terminal complement activation markers (elevated C3 and sC5b-9). INTERPRETATION: Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibiting cytokine release marks, complement activation, or B-lymphocyte defects are distinct from each other. Such immunologic variability argues in favor of targeting different mediators in different groups of patients and could serve as a basis for patient identification and clinical trial eligibility.","Dupont, Thibault; Caillat-Zucman, Sophie; Fremeaux-Bacchi, Véronique; Morin, Florence; Lengliné, Etienne; Darmon, Michael; Peffault de Latour, Régis; Zafrani, Lara; Azoulay, Elie; Dumas, Guillaume",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220353514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316234/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.11.049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220353514,36

This study explores whether machine learning combined with frailty modeling could determine the least sensor-derived features required to identify physical frailty and three key frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, and exhaustion). Older participants (n = 102, age = 76.54 ± 7.72 years) were fitted with five wearable sensors and completed a five times sit-to-stand test. Seventeen sensor-derived features were extracted and used for optimal feature selection based on a machine learning technique combined with frailty modeling. Mean of hip angular velocity range (indicator of slowness), mean of vertical power range (indicator of weakness), and coefficient of variation of vertical power range (indicator of exhaustion) were selected as the optimal features. A frailty model with the three optimal features had an area under the curve of 85.20%, a sensitivity of 82.70%, and a specificity of 71.09%. This study suggests that the three sensor-derived features could be used as digital biomarkers of physical frailty and phenotypes of slowness, weakness, and exhaustion.

605019,Modelling the impact of COVID-19 on HIV,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the care of patients with COVID-19 has changed and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has increased. We aimed to examine patient selection, treatments, outcomes, and ECMO centre characteristics over the course of the pandemic to date. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry and COVID-19 Addendum to compare three groups of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥16 years). At early-adopting centres—ie, those using ECMO support for COVID-19 throughout 2020—we compared patients who started ECMO on or before May 1, 2020 (group A1), and between May 2 and Dec 31, 2020 (group A2). Late-adopting centres were those that provided ECMO for COVID-19 only after May 1, 2020 (group B). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in a time-to-event analysis assessed 90 days after ECMO initiation. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to compare the patient and centre-level adjusted relative risk of mortality among the groups. FINDINGS: In 2020, 4812 patients with COVID-19 received ECMO across 349 centres within 41 countries. For early-adopting centres, the cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation was 36·9% (95% CI 34·1–39·7) in patients who started ECMO on or before May 1 (group A1) versus 51·9% (50·0–53·8) after May 1 (group A2); at late-adopting centres (group B), it was 58·9% (55·4–62·3). Relative to patients in group A2, group A1 patients had a lower adjusted relative risk of in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO (hazard ratio 0·82 [0·70−0·96]), whereas group B patients had a higher adjusted relative risk (1·42 [1·17−1·73]). INTERPRETATION: Mortality after ECMO for patients with COVID-19 worsened during 2020. These findings inform the role of ECMO in COVID-19 for patients, clinicians, and policy makers.

To identify and characterise the cause of diarrhoea observed during previous years, 164 animals on 14 dairy farms in northwestern Germany were included in this study. The calves were physically and parasitologically examined prior to turnout and until 21 days post turnout (d.p.t.). Mean animal weights decreased from 194.9 kg at the start to 189.3 kg bodyweight at the end of the study. In all herds, oocyst counts were very low prior to turnout and increased after the calves had been kept on pasture for at least 7 days. On Day 9 post turnout, 90% and at the end of the study (21 d.p.t.) 70% of all animals showed Eimeria-positive faecal samples. During the course of the study, 79 (48.2%) animals passed faecal samples with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram. The predominant species identified was Eimeria alabamensis, which accounted for more than 83% of the oocysts counted. These parasitological findings matched the clinical observations. Diarrhoea was found in 130 (79.3%) of the study animals. At 5 d.p.t. and thus prior to the rise of faecal oocyst counts, a significant increase in diarrhoea was recorded. Calves showing diarrhoea excreted statistically significantly more often over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p = 0.0002) than calves without diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was also found during significantly more study days in animals with high oocyst counts (0.39; p = 0.0001). These data indicate that in endemic areas first-year grazing calves must be considered at risk to develop clinical coccidiosis due to E. alabamensis infection during the first 2–3 weeks post turnout.","von Samson-Himmelstjerna, G.; Epe, C.; Wirtherle, N.; von der Heyden, V.; Welz, C.; Radeloff, I.; Beening, J.; Carr, D.; Hellmann, K.; Schnieder, T.; Krieger, K.",Vet Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16387444/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401705005662; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401705005662,36

605390,A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19),2020-06-15,"Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics’ lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world’s populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.","Parham, Shokoh; Kharazi, Anousheh Zargar; Bakhsheshi-Rad, Hamid Reza; Nur, Hadi; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi; Sharif, Safian; RamaKrishna, Seeram; Berto, Filippo",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9121309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371338/,36

To achieve this, a llama was immunized using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an immune phage-display library of variable domains was developed. The sdAbs selected from this library segregated into five distinct sequence families. Three of these families bind to unique epitopes with high affinity, low nM to sub-nM K(D), as determined by surface plasmon resonance. To further enhance the utility of these sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein, homobivalent and heterobivalent genetic fusion constructs of the three high-affinity sdAbs were prepared. The effectiveness of the sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein was evaluated using MagPlex fluid array assays, a multiplexed immunoassay on color-coded magnetic microspheres. Using the optimal bivalent pair, one immobilized on the microsphere and the other serving as the biotinylated recognition reagent, a detection limit as low as 50 pg/mL of recombinant nucleocapsid and of killed virus down to 1.28 × 10(3) pfu/mL was achieved. The sdAbs described here represent immune reagents that can be tailored to be optimized for a number of detection platforms and may one day aid in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assist in controlling the current pandemic.","Anderson, George P.; Liu, Jinny L.; Esparza, Thomas J.; Voelker, Bruce T.; Hofmann, E.

This study was designed to develop a national health emergency management program based on risk assessment for COVID-19. METHODS: Mixed-methods research was used. Based on recommendations of the national epidemiology committee, 2 risk scenarios were used as basic scenarios for risk assessment. Two rounds of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted between January and May 2020 with 30 representatives of the health system. The data were collected, analyzed, and integrated by the research team. RESULTS: In the risk matrix, “contamination of environment and individuals” and “burnout of medical staff” occupied the red zone (intolerable risk). “Defects in screening and admissions,” “process disruption in medical care and rehabilitation,” “increased mental disorders,” “social dissatisfaction,” “the decline in healthcare services,” and “loss of medical staff” were identified as the orange zone (significant risk) of the matrix. CONCLUSIONS: The avoidance of environmental and individual contamination and healthcare worker burnout are the priorities in Iran. Attention to intersectoral cooperation, the involvement of non-governmental organizations and private center capacities, integration of information health systems, and developing evidence-based protocols are other measures that can improve the health system’s capacity in the response COVID-19.","Khankeh, Hamidreza; Kolivand, Pirhossein; Fathi, Mohammad; Lornejad, Hamidreza; Abbasabadi-Arab, Masoumeh",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096490/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.168,36
610538,Gut-brain axis in the neurological comorbidity of COVID-19,2021-05-27,"Background Rhinovirus-induced early wheezing has been suggested as a new important risk factor for recurrent wheezing. Objective We sought to investigate the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and to determine post hoc the efficacy of prednisolone in risk groups. Methods We followed for 1 year 118 children (median age, 1.1 years) who had had their first episode of wheezing and had participated in a trial comparing prednisolone with placebo in hospitalized children. Demographics and laboratory data were obtained at study entry. The follow-up outcome was recurrent wheezing (3 physician-confirmed episodes). Results Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed in 44 (37%) children. Independent risk factors were age < 1 year, atopy, and maternal asthma. The probability of recurrent wheezing was higher in rhinovirus than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–affected children among placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 5.05; 95% CI, 1.00-25.41). Prednisolone decreased the probability of recurrent wheezing in children with eczema (0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63) but not in those without eczema (1.89; 95% CI, 0.83-4.29; P = .007 for interaction). Prednisolone was associated with less recurrent wheezing in the rhinovirus group (0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.71), but not in the RSV (2.12; 95% CI, 0.46-9.76) or in the RSV/rhinovirus-negative groups (2.03; 95% CI, 0.83-5.00; P = .017 for interaction). Conclusion Rhinovirus-induced early wheezing is a major viral risk factor for recurrent wheezing. Prednisolone may prevent recurrent wheezing in rhinovirus-affected first-time wheezers. The presence of eczema may also influence the response to prednisolone. Clinical implications A prospective trial is needed to test the hypothesis that prednisolone reduces recurrent wheezing in rhinovirus-affected wheezing children.","Lehtinen, Pasi; Ruohola, Aino; Vanto, Timo; Vuorinen, Tytti; Ruuskanen, Olli; Jartti, Tuomas",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17196244/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674906023384; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674906023384,36

On one hand, understanding the elements’ formation and their specific properties related to their electronic and nucleonic structure may lead to understanding whether future solutions to replace certain elements or materials for specific technical applications are realistic. On the other hand, finding solutions to the critical availability of some of these elements is an urgent need. Even the analysis of the availability of scarce minerals from European Union sources leads to the suggestion that a wide-ranging approach is essential. These two fundamental assumptions represent also the logical approach that led the European Commission to ask for a multi-disciplinary effort from the scientific community to tackle the challenge of Critical Raw Materials.

Measuring and understanding the drivers and impacts of this financial health hardship is an economic and public health priority, particularly in the time of COVID-19. This is the first study that measures the financial hardship and determines associated factors in Afghanistan. METHODS: Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey data for 2016–2017 was used for this study. We calculated incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure by using different thresholds ranging from 5 to 40% of total and nonfood consumption and subsequent impoverishment due to OOPs. Logistic regression was used to assess the degree to which Afghan households are protected from the catastrophic household expenditure. RESULTS: Results revealed that 32% of the population in Afghanistan incurred catastrophic health expenditure (as 10% of total consumption) and when healthcare payments are netted out of household consumption, the Afghan population live in extreme poverty ($1.9 in 2011 PPP), increased from 29 to 36%. Based on our findings from logistic regression in Afghanistan, having an educated head or being employed are protective factors from financial hardship while having a female head, an elderly member, a disabled, or a sick member are the risk factors of facing catastrophic health expenditure. Moreover, the people living in rural/nomadic areas or facing an economic shock are more likely to face catastrophic health expenditure and hence to be impoverished due to direct OOPs on health. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of poverty and catastrophic health expenditure in Afghanistan emphasizes the need to strengthen the health financing system. Although Afghanistan has made great efforts to support households against health expenditure burden during the pandemic, households are at higher risk of poverty and financial hardship due to OOPs. Therefore, there is need for more financial and supportive response policies by providing a better and easier access to primary health services, extending to all entitlement to health services particularly in the public sector, eliminating user fees for COVID-19 health services and suspending fees for other essential health services, expanding coverage of income support, and strengthening the overall health financing system.","Dastan, Ilker; Abbasi, Asiyeh; Arfa, Chokri; Hashimi, Mir Najmuddin; Alawi, Said Mohammad Karim",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218808/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06613-y,36

Negotiated information orders within and among the organizations in a field (here, e.g., the World Health Organization, member states, government agencies, and international non‐governmental organizations) spell out relationships among different categories of knowledge and non‐knowledge – what is known, acknowledged to be known, and available for use in decision making versus what might be known but cannot be acknowledged or officially used. Through information leveraging, technically sufficient information then becomes socially sufficient information. Thus it is especially information initially categorized as non‐knowledge – including suppressed data, rumour, unverified evidence, and unofficial information – that creates pressure for the renegotiation of information orders.

However, the antegrade approach is difficult when accessing veins with small diameters; therefore, understanding the variation of deep calf vein is important. METHODS: This study measured the diameters and surface areas of the proximal and distal posterior tibial vein, peroneal vein, and anterior tibial vein to determine which are preferable for venous access. This study dissected 132 legs from Korean and Thai cadavers. The proximal and distal posterior tibial vein, peroneal vein, and anterior tibial vein were scanned and measured. RESULTS: The mean diameter and surface area were largest for the proximal tibial vein, at 6.34 mm and 0.312 cm(2), respectively, followed by the anterior tibial vein (5.22 mm and 0.213 cm(2)), distal posterior tibial vein (3.29 mm and 0.091 cm(2)), and peroneal vein (3.43 mm and 0.081 cm(2)). The proximal posterior tibial vein and anterior tibial vein have large diameters and surface areas, which make them ideal for applying an antegrade approach in catheter-directed thrombolysis.

612699,"Sensitive, Rapid, Low-Cost, and Multiplexed COVID-19 Monitoring by the Wireless Telemedicine Platform",2020-12-02,"Abstract Typical and atypical antipsychotics are the first-line treatments for schizophrenia, but these classes of drugs are not universally effective, and they can have serious side effects that impact compliance. Antipsychotic drugs generally target the dopamine pathways with some variation. As research of schizophrenia pathophysiology has shifted away from a strictly dopamine-centric focus, the development of new pharmacotherapies has waned. A field of inquiry with centuries-old roots is gaining traction in psychiatric research circles and may represent a new frontier for drug discovery in schizophrenia. At the forefront of this investigative effort is the immune system and its many components, pathways and phenotypes, which are now known to actively engage the brain. Studies in schizophrenia reveal an intricate association of environmentally-driven immune activation in concert with a disrupted genetic template. A consistent conduit through this gene-environmental milieu is the gut-brain axis, which when dysregulated can generate pathological autoimmunity. In this review, we present epidemiological and biochemical evidence in support of an autoimmune component in schizophrenia and depict gut processes and a dysbiotic microbiome as a source and perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction in the brain. Within this framework, we review the role of infectious agents, inflammation, gut dysbioses and autoantibody propagation on CNS pathologies such as neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction and complement pathway-mediated synaptic pruning. We then review the new pharmacotherapeutic horizon and novel agents directed to impact these pathological conditions. At the core of this discourse is the understanding that schizophrenia is etiologically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous and thus its treatment requires individualized attention with disease state variants diagnosed with objective biomarkers.","Severance, Emily G.; Dickerson, Faith B.; Yolken, Robert H.",Pharmacology & Therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742478/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725818300792; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725818300792,36

METHODS: We obtained serum proteomic profiles from patients with active tuberculosis and controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. We used k-fold cross validation and random sampling of the SVM classifier to assess the classifier further. Relevant mass peaks were selected by correlational analysis and assessed with SVM. We tested the diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers, identified by peptide mass fingerprinting, by conventional immunoassays and SVM classifiers trained on these data. FINDINGS: Our SVM classifier discriminated the proteomic profile of patients with active tuberculosis from that of controls with overlapping clinical features. Diagnostic accuracy was 94% (sensitivity 93·5%, specificity 94·9%) for patients with tuberculosis and was unaffected by HIV status. A classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90%. From these peaks, two peptides (serum amyloid A protein and transthyretin) were identified and quantitated by immunoassay. Because these peptides reflect inflammatory states, we also quantitated neopterin and C reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84% for tuberculosis. Validation on a second, prospectively collected testing set gave similar accuracies using the whole proteomic signature and the 20 selected peaks. Using combinations of the four biomarkers, we achieved diagnostic accuracies of up to 78%. INTERPRETATION: The potential biomarkers for tuberculosis that we identified through proteomic fingerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests.","Agranoff, Dan; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro; Papadopoulos, Marios C; Rojas, Sergio A; Herbster, Mark; Loosemore, Alison; Tarelli, Edward; Sheldon, Jo; Schwenk, Achim; Pollok, Richard; Rayner, Charlotte FJ; Krishna, Sanjeev",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16980117/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606693422; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673606693422,36
613054,The Possible Role of Sex As an Important Factor in Development and Administration of Lipid Nanomedicine-Based COVID-19 Vaccine,2021-05-13,"Composite dust generation is most likely a continuous and daily procedure in dental practice settings. The aim of this systematic review was to identify, compile and evaluate existing evidence on interventions and composite material properties related to the production of aerosolized dust during routine dental procedures. Seven electronic databases were searched, with no limits, supplemented by a manual search, on 27 April 2020 for published and unpublished research. Eligibility criteria comprised of studies of any design, describing composite dust production related to the implementation of any procedure in dental practice. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment was undertaken independently either in duplicate, or confirmed by a second reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed where applicable. A total of 375 articles were initially identified, resulting in 13 articles being included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 5 contributed to meta-analyses overall. Risk of bias recordings ranged between low and high, pertaining to unclear/raising some concerns, in most cases. All types of composites, irrespective of the filler particles, released significant amounts of nano-sized particles after being ground, with potentially disruptive respiratory effects. Evidence supported increased % distribution of particles < 100 nm for nanocomposite Filtek Supreme XTE compared to both conventional hybrid Z100MP (SMD: 1.96, 95% CI: 0.85, 3.07; p-value; 0.001) and nano- hybrid Tetric EvoCeram (SMD: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.56, 2.68; p-value: 0.003). For cytotoxicity considerations of generated aerosolized particles, both nanocomposites Filtek Supreme XTE and nanohybrid GradiO revealed negative effects on bronchial epithelial cell viability, as represented by % formazan reduction at 330–400 μg/mL for 24 hours, with no recorded differences between them (SMD: 0.19; 95% CI: −0.17, 0.55; p-value: 0.30). Effective and more rigorous management of dental procedures potentially liable to the generation of considerable amounts of aerosolized composite dust should be prioritized in contemporary dental practice. In essence, protective measures for the clinician and the practices’ personnel should also be systematically promoted and additional interventions may be considered in view of the existing evidence.","Iliadi, Anna; Koletsi, Despina; Eliades, Theodore; Eliades, George",Materials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13112513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486443/,36

615186,A statistical perspective to the QTc interval in the treatment of COVID-19,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Obesity remains one of the most challenging public health issues of our modern time. Despite the face validity of claims for influence, studies on the causes of obesity have reported the influence of the food environment to be inconsistent. This inconsistency has been attributed to the variability of measures used by researchers to represent the food environments—Researcher-Defined Food Environments (RDFE) like circular, street-network buffers, and others. This study (i.) determined an individual’s Activity Space (AS) (ii.) explored the accuracy of the RDFE in representing the AS, (iii.) investigated the accuracy of the RDFE in representing actual exposure, and (iv.) explored whether exposure to food outlet reflects the use of food outlets. METHODS: Data were collected between June and December 2018. A total of 65 participants collected Global Positioning System (GPS) data, kept receipt of all their food purchases, completed a questionnaire about their personal information and had their weight and height measured. A buffer was created around the GPS points and merged to form an AS (GPS-based AS). RESULTS: Statistical and geospatial analyses found that the AS size of participants working away from home was positively related to the Euclidean distance from home to workplace; the orientation (shape) of AS was also influenced by the direction of workplace from home and individual characteristics were not predictive of the size of AS. Consistent with some previous studies, all types and sizes of RDFE variably misrepresented individual exposure in the food environments. Importantly, the accuracy of the RDFE was significantly improved by including both the home and workplace domains. The study also found no correlation between exposure and use of food outlets. CONCLUSIONS: Home and workplace are key activity nodes in modelling AS or food environments and the relationship between exposure and use is more complex than is currently suggested in both empirical and policy literature.","Marwa, Windi Lameck; Radley, Duncan; Davis, Samantha; McKenna, James; Griffiths, Claire",Int J Health Geogr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-021-00287-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320996/,36

Evidence about kidney transplant (KTx) recipients is still limited. A systematic literature review was performed. We included 63 articles published from 1 January until 7 July 2020, reporting on 420 adult KTx recipients with confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 55 ± 15 years. There was a male predominance (67%). The majority (74%) were deceased donor recipients, and 23% were recently transplanted (<1 year). Most patients (88%) had at least one comorbidity, 29% had two, and 18% three. Ninety-three percent of cases were hospitalized. Among them, 30% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 45% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 44% had acute kidney injury with 23% needing renal replacement therapy. From the hospitalized patients a total of 22% died, 59% were discharged, and 19% were still in hospital at the time of publication. Immunosuppression was reduced in 27%, discontinued in 31%, and remained unchanged in 5%. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 78% of patients, antibiotics to 73%, and antivirals to 30% while 25% received corticosteroid boluses, 28% received anti-interleukin agents, and 8% were given immunoglobulin.

HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein B1) is one of the key proinflammatory factors in the ARDS “inflammatory storm.” According to previous studies, some microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in this process. We aimed to determine the contributing miRNAs targeting the expression and release of HMGB1. miRNA expression in the peripheral blood of patients with ARDS was measured by miRNA microarray. miRNAs targeting HMGB1 were screened and explored for further study. In LPS-induced cell and mouse ARDS models, we explored the effect of this miRNA on the expression and secretion of HMGB1 by Western blot, real-time qPCR, and ELISA. The effects of this miRNA on the NF-κB signaling pathway, proinflammatory cytokines, and NLRP3 (nod-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome were detected by Western blot and real-time qPCR. In ARDS models, microRNA-574-5p (miR-574-5p) expression could be induced by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway upon LPS stimulation. It could suppress the inflammatory response by targeting HMGB1. Enforcing the expression of miR-574-5p or HMGB1 siRNA silencing inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, overexpression of HMGB1 reversed the antiinflammatory effect of miR-574-5p. In ARDS mice, overexpression of miR-574-5p suppresses alveolar leukocytes infiltration, interstitial edema, protein effusion, and inflammation. This study demonstrated that miR-574-5p provided negative feedback to LPS-induced inflammation and relieved ARDS. It may provide new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.","He, Binchan; Zhou, Wei; Rui, Yuwen; Liu, Lulu; Chen, Bilin; Su, Xin",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0112oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33202146/,36

616879,Hesitant or Not Hesitant? A Systematic Review on Global COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in Different Populations,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory tract infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV), are common and life-threatening illnesses worldwide. The mechanisms by which viruses are removed from the respiratory tract are indispensable for airway host defense. Mucociliary clearance is an airway defense mechanism that removes pathogens from the respiratory tract. The coordination and modulation of the ciliary beating of airway epithelial cells play key roles in maintaining effective mucociliary clearance. However, the impact of respiratory virus infection on ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance remains unclear. METHODS: Tracheal samples were taken from wild-type (WT) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-knockout (KO) mice. Transient organ culture of murine trachea was performed in the presence or absence of IAV, polyI:C, a synthetic TLR3 ligand, and/or reagents. Subsequently, cilia-driven flow and ciliary motility were analyzed. To evaluate cilia-driven flow, red fluorescent beads were loaded into culture media and movements of the beads onto the tracheal surface were observed using a fluorescence microscope. To evaluate ciliary motility, cilia tips were labeled with Indian ink diluted with culture medium. The motility of ink-labeled cilia tips was recorded by high-speed cameras. RESULTS: Short-term IAV infection significantly increased cilia-driven flow and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) compared with the control level in WT culture. Whereas IAV infection did not elicit any increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF in TLR3-KO culture, indicating that TLR3 was essential to elicit an increase of cilia-driven flow and CBF in response to IAV infection. TLR3 activation by polyI:C readily induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from the trachea and increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF in WT culture, but not in TLR3-KO culture. Moreover, blockade of purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) signaling using P2R antagonist, suramin, suppressed polyI:C-mediated increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF, indicating that TLR3-mediated ciliary activation depended on released extracellular ATP and the autocrine ATP-P2R loop. CONCLUSIONS: IAV infection readily increases ciliary activity and cilia-driven flow via TLR3 activation in the airway epithelium, thereby hastening mucociliary clearance and “sweeping” viruses from the airway as an initial host defense response. Mechanically, extracellular ATP release in response to TLR3 activation promotes ciliary activity through autocrine ATP-P2R loop.","Kamiya, Yosuke; Fujisawa, Tomoyuki; Katsumata, Mineo; Yasui, Hideki; Suzuki, Yuzo; Karayama, Masato; Hozumi, Hironao; Furuhashi, Kazuki; Enomoto, Noriyuki; Nakamura, Yutaro; Inui, Naoki; Setou, Mitsutoshi; Ito, Masahiko; Suzuki, Tetsuro; Ikegami, Koji; Suda, Takafumi",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109186/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-020-01555-1,36

The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA. Treatment-dependent effects on DNA yield, genus-level taxonomic abundance, and alpha and beta diversity metrics were assessed. A sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-based inactivation method and Holder pasteurization had no effect on measures of microbial richness, while two Buffer AVL-based inactivation methods resulted in a decrease in detected richness. SDS inactivation, Holder pasteurization, and the AVL-based inactivation methods had no effect on measures of alpha diversity within samples or beta diversity between samples. Fecal DNA extracted with TRIzol-treated samples failed to amplify and sequence, making it unsuitable for microbiome analysis.

Many controversies exist related to the safety and effectiveness of this combination, and questions about how HCQ‐AZM combination affects the ventricular repolarization are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to show whether the hydroxychloroquine–azithromycin (HCQ‐AZM) combination prolonged Tpeak‐to‐end (TpTe) duration and TpTe/QT interval ratio or not. METHODS: One hundred and twenty‐six consequent COVID‐19(+) patients meeting the study criteria were enrolled in this study. Baseline ECGs were obtained immediately after hospitalization and before commencing the HCQ‐AZM combination. On‐treatment ECG was obtained 24–48 hr after the loading dose of HCQ/AZM. ECG parameters including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTc interval, TpTe duration, and TpTe/QT interval ratio were assessed. Demographic and laboratory findings were collected from an electronic recording system. RESULTS: ECGs of 126 COVID‐19(+) patients who received HCQ‐AZM combination were assessed. Mean baseline QTc (by Fridericia formula), TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio were 420.0 ± 26.5 ms, 82.43 ± 9.77 ms, and 0.22 ± 0.02, respectively.

Study design We reviewed clinical history, diagnostic studies, explant histology, genetic sequence results, and post-transplant course for 6 infants with atypical ACDMPV who underwent bilateral lung transplantation at St. Louis Children's Hospital. We compared their histology with infants with classic ACDMPV and compared their outcomes with infants transplanted for other indications. Results In contrast with neonates with classic ACDPMV who present with severe hypoxemia and refractory pulmonary hypertension within hours of birth, none of the infants with atypical ACDMPV presented with progressive neonatal respiratory failure. Three infants had mild neonatal respiratory distress and received nasal cannula oxygen. Three other infants had no respiratory symptoms at birth and presented with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension at 2-3 months of age. Bilateral lung transplantation was performed at 4-20 months of age. Unlike in classic ACDMPV, histopathologic findings were not distributed uniformly and were not diffuse. Three subjects had apparent nonmosaic genetic defects involving FOXF1. Two infants had extrapulmonary anomalies (posterior urethral valves, inguinal hernia). Three transplanted children are alive at 5-16 years of age, similar to outcomes for infants transplanted for other indications. Lung explants from infants with atypical ACDMPV demonstrated diagnostic but nonuniform histopathologic findings. Conclusions The 1- and 5-year survival rates for infants with atypical ACDMPV are similar to infants transplanted for other indications. Given the clinical and histopathologic spectra, ACDMPV should be considered in infants with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension, even beyond the newborn period.","Towe, Christopher T.; White, Frances V.; Grady, R.

With the aim to timely judge the epidemic peak and provide support for decisions for resuming production and returning to normal life based on publicly reported data, we used a seven-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named the “epidemic evaluation index” (EEI). We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong to verify the practicability of the new index, and then applied it to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis. The results showed that the epidemic peaked, respectively, on 9 February and 5 February 2020, in Hubei Province and other provinces in China. The proposed index can be applied for judging the epidemic peak.

One hundred and thirty‐eight samples from 95 COVID‐19 patients with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were analyzed to assess the clinical sensitivity. Seventy‐six pre‐COVID‐19 samples were used to evaluate the clinical specificity. Two independent and blinded raters determined visually the presence or absence of the IgG, IgM, and control lines for each test after 10 and 20 min. The sensitivity obtained from collected samples more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms was 95.2% for IgG. IgM was less frequently detected (highest sensitivity of 20.5%). The specificities obtained were 98.7% and 100% for IgG and IgM, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was better when the reading was performed at 20 min than at 10 min, whereas the specificity was unchanged.

An Italian survey,2020-05-20,"Virtual care, the use of videoconferencing technology to connect with patients, has become critical in providing continuing care for patients during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual care has now been adopted by health care providers across the spectrum, including physicians, residents, nurse practitioners, nurses, and allied health care professionals. Virtual care is novel and nuanced compared to in-person care. Most of the health care providers who are delivering or expected to deliver virtual care have little to no prior experience with it. The nuances of virtual care involve regulatory standards, platforms, technology and troubleshooting, patient selection, etiquette, and workflow, all of which comprise critical points in the provision of health care. It is important to consistently deliver high-quality, equitable, and professional virtual care to inspire patients with the trust they need to continue follow-up of their care in these difficult times. We have been adopting virtual care in our clinical practice for over two years. In partnership with Canada Health Infoway, we have assembled a primer for virtual care that can serve as a guide for any health care provider in Canada and globally, with the goal of providing seamless transitions between in-person and virtual care.","Wong, Andy; Bhyat, Rashaad; Srivastava, Siddhartha; Boissé Lomax, Lysa; Appireddy, Ramana",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326410/,36

Usually they are small and have to assemble to form channels which depolarize the lipid membrane of the host cells. Structural information is just about to emerge for just some of them. Thus, computational methods play a pivotal role in generating plausible structures which can be used in the drug development process. In this review the accumulation of structural data is introduced from a historical perspective. Computational performances and their predictive power are reported guided by biological questions such as the assembly, mechanism of function and drug–protein interaction of VCPs. An outlook of how coarse grained simulations can contribute to yet unexplored issues of these proteins is given. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C.

Different pathogenic mechanisms have been postulated basing on clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging features, and response to treatments. Here we provide an overview with insights built on the available reports. Besides direct viral pathogenicity, a crucial role seems to be represented by immune-mediated mechanisms, supporting and further characterizing the already hypothesized neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and implying specific treatments.

A total of 73 moderate patients (38 men, 35 women) were included, with median age of 47.0 (38.5–57.5) years. Among them, only one patient (1.4%) died using active treatment to improve symptoms. The median duration of the four main symptoms cough, fever, chest tightness, and fatigue were 11.0, 8.0, 11.0, and 7.0 days, respectively; the median duration of the positive nucleic acid test (NAT) results for SARS-CoV-2 was 16.5 days; the median hospitalization time was 25.0 days in 72 moderate survivors. The duration of cough and fever was positively correlated with the duration of the positive NAT results. On admission, 50% had lymphopenia; less than 30% had abnormal blood biochemistry findings involving hyperglycemia, liver function and myocardial enzymes. At discharge, the laboratory indexes were substantially improved. Two weeks after discharge, 5.6% survivors experienced a recurrence of the positive NAT results.

The presence of even a few chains accelerates the very slow dynamics of an otherwise free protein chain in the native phase. The radius of gyration depends nonmonotonically on temperature and increases with the protein concentration in both the native and denatured phase. The density of organized morphology over residue-to-sample length scales (λ) is quantified by an effective dimension (D) that varies between ~ 2 at high to ~ 3 at low temperatures at λ ~ R(g) with an overall lower density (D ~ 2) on larger scales. The magnitude of D depends on temperature, length scale, and concentration of proteins, i.e., D ~ 3.2 at λ ~ R(g), D ~ 2.6 at λ > R(g), and D ~ 2.0 at λ ≫ R(g), at T = 0.024.","Sompornpisut, Pornthep; Pandey, R.

METHODS: Using a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise. RESULTS: We demonstrate that for districts that were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after three rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay to reaching elimination targets greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where the probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets. CONCLUSION: Through appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.","Borlase, Anna; Blumberg, Seth; Callahan, E Kelly; Deiner, Michael S; Nash, Scott D; Porco, Travis C; Solomon, Anthony W; Lietman, Thomas M; Prada, Joaquin M; Hollingsworth, T Dèirdre",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596317/; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa171,36

The aim of this study was to investigate whether results from metabolomics studies on animal models for IBD were similar to those from studies on IBD patients. Medline and Embase were searched for relevant studies up to May 2017. The Covidence systematic review software was used for study screening, and quality assessment was conducted for all included studies. Data showed a convergence of ~17% for metabolites differentiated between IBD and controls in human and animal studies with amino acids being the most differentiated metabolite subclass. The acute dextran sodium sulfate model appeared as a good model for analysis of systemic metabolites in IBD, but analytical platform, age, and biological sample type did not show clear correlations with any significant metabolites. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the variation in metabolomics results, and emphasizes the importance of expanding the applied detection methods to ensure greater coverage and convergence between the various different patient phenotypes and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease.","Knudsen, Lina Almind; Desdorf, Rasmus; Möller, Sören; Sørensen, Signe Bek; Hansen, Axel Kornerup; Andersen, Vibeke",Int. j. mol. sci.

To our knowledge, little information is available about the regulatory effect of NO on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection. This study was conducted to investigate the antiviral activity of NO generated from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), during PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice. RESULTS: GSNO released considerable NO in the culture medium of PK-15 cells, and NO was scavenged by its scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) in a dose-dependent manner. NO strongly inhibited PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells, and the antiviral effect was reversed by Hb. An in vivo assay indicated that GSNO treatment reduced the progression of PCV2 infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of PCV2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral DNA copies in serum samples. GSNO also improved the growth performance and immune organs (spleens and thymuses) of the PCV2-infected mice to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the NO-generating compound GSNO suppresses PCV2 infection in PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice, indicating that NO and its donor, GSNO, have potential value as antiviral drugs against PCV2 infection.","Liu, Chuanmin; Wen, Libin; Xiao, Qi; He, Kongwang",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222773/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-0976-9,36

Severe and critical cases are characterized by damage to the respiratory system, endothelial inflammation, and multiple organ failure triggered by an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in the high number of deaths all over the world. Sedentarism induces worse, continuous, and progressive consequences to health. On the other hand, physical activity provides benefits to health and improves low-grade systemic inflammation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the effects of physical activity in physical fitness, immune defense, and its contribution to mitigate the severe inflammatory response mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Physical exercise is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, studies have shown that acute physical exercise induces the production of myokines that are secreted in tissues and into the bloodstream, supporting its systemic modulatory effect. Therefore, maintaining physical activity influence balance the immune system and increases immune vigilance, and also might promote potent effects against the consequences of infectious diseases and chronic diseases associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. Protocols to maintain exercise practice are suggested and have been strongly established, such as home-based exercise (HBE) and outdoor-based exercise (OBE). In this regard, HBE might help to reduce levels of physical inactivity, bed rest, and sitting time, impacting on adherence to physical activity, promoting all the benefits related to exercise, and attracting patients in different stages of treatment for COVID-19. In parallel, OBE must improve health, but also prevent and mitigate COVID-19 severe outcomes in all populations.

The comparison between the antibody response to an inactivated Covid19 vaccine and the antibodies that developed during Covid-19 infection has not been elucidated. In this study, vaccine-induced antibody levels were compared with the antibodies developed in naturally infected HCWs. Methods Eighty vaccinated individuals and 80 Covid-19 patients enrolled to the study. Both groups were matched on age, gender and antibody testing time. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig (Roche) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun, Germany) were used to detect antibodies. Results The anti-S positivity were determined to be 96.2% and 92.5% in vaccinated and patient groups (p=0.303) while the anti-N positivity was 51.2% and 98.8%, respectively (p=<0,0001). The median values for anti-S and anti-N antibodies were statistically significant between both groups. When the vaccinated group was compared with the severe and non-severe patient groups, statistically significant differences were found for both regarding anti-S1 and anti-N antibody titers (p=0,012, p=<0,0001, respectively). For the patient group, there was a positive correlation between the age and anti-S1 antibody titers (r=0.333; p=0.003) and there was also a statistically significant increase in anti-N antibody titers in time (r=0.505; p=0.0001). Conclusion The anti-S seroconversion ratio in vaccinated individuals were higher than what was reported by the vaccine manufacturer. The antibody titers in the vaccinated group were lower than the patients group.

SHR0302 is an oral, highly selective, Janus kinase 1 inhibitor under investigation for inflammatory skin diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of SHR0302 in Chinese patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase II trial was conducted in China between October 2019 and August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 105) aged 18–75 years with moderate to severe dermatitis and nonresponsive or intolerant to topical or conventional systemic treatments were included. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive SHR0302 4 mg once daily, SHR0302 8 mg once daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response (IGA of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] with improvement of ≥2 grades) at week 12. Secondary efficacy assessments included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores. RESULTS: At week 12, IGA response was achieved in nine patients (25.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI] 13.6–37.9%; p = 0.022) in the SHR0302 4 mg group, 19 patients (54.3%; 90% CI 40.4–68.1%; p < 0.001) in the SHR0302 8 mg group, and two patients (5.7%; 90% CI 0.0–12.2%) in the placebo group.

We introduce biosensors aimed at detecting severe cases of COVID-19 in decentralized healthcare settings. They consist of a paper immunosensor interfaced with a smartphone. The immunosensors have been designed to generate intense colorimetric signals when the sample contains ultralow concentrations of IL-6, which has been proposed as a prognosis biomarker of COVID-19. This is achieved by combining a paper-based signal amplification mechanism with polymer-filled reservoirs for dispensing antibody-decorated nanoparticles and a bespoken app for color quantification. With this design we achieved a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10(−3) pg mL(-1) and semi-quantitative measurements in a wide dynamic range between 10(−3) and 10(2) pg mL(-1) in PBS. The assay time is under 10 min. The low LOD allowed us to dilute blood samples and detect IL-6 with an LOD of 1.3 pg mL(-1) and a dynamic range up to 10(2) pg mL(-1). Following this protocol, we were able to stratify COVID-19 patients according to different blood levels of IL-6. We also report on the detection of IL-6 in respiratory samples (bronchial aspirate, BAS) from COVID-19 patients. The test could be easily adapted to detect other cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-8 by changing the antibodies decorating the nanoparticles accordingly.

The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Our results suggest that less than ten days after the Moroccan government announced “Health state of Emergency” response to the COVID-19 outbreak, public knowledge, attitude and responses to the pandemic were relatively high. More than half the respondents (63.2%) reported that they complied with more than five of nine recommended safety measures, including avoiding going out (93.2%), and frequent handwashing with soap and water (78.2%). Factors associated with an increased likelihood to adopt safety measures included perceptions that COVID-19 was a human health risk, the pandemic will continue for a long time, availability of clear information, and a lack of medicine. The largest predictor of safety behavior change was age; participants older than 55 were more likely to adopt recommended safety behaviors. Although knowledge and perception among the general public was reasonable, more encouragement from government via health education programs is needed to maintain appropriate behaviors.","Berni, Imane; Menouni, Aziza; Zegzouti, Younes Filali; Kestemont, Marie-Paule; Godderis, Lode; El Jaafari, Samir",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071889/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115745,36
627187,Potential COVID-19 therapeutics from a rare disease: weaponizing lipid dysregulation to combat viral infectivity,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: There is a clear need for vaccines and therapeutics for potential biological weapons of mass destruction and emerging diseases. Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously. Although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection, it does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to B. anthracis exotoxin accumulation. The bipartite exotoxins are the major contributing factors to the morbidity and mortality observed in acute anthrax infections. METHODS: Using recombinant B. anthracis protective antigen (PA83), covalently coupled to a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide (NT-MDP) derivative we hyper-immunized goats three times over the course of 14 weeks. Goats were plasmapheresed and the IgG fraction (not affinity purified) and F(ab')(2 )derivatives were characterized in vitro and in vivo for protection against lethal toxin mediated intoxication. RESULTS: Anti-PA83 IgG conferred 100% protection at 7.5 μg in a cell toxin neutralization assay. Mice exposed to 5 LD(50 )of Bacillus anthracis Ames spores by intranares inoculation demonstrated 60% survival 14 d post-infection when administered a single bolus dose (32 mg/kg body weight) of anti-PA83 IgG at 24 h post spore challenge. Anti-PA83 F(ab')(2 )fragments retained similar neutralization and protection levels both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The protection afforded by these GMP-grade caprine immunotherapeutics post-exposure in the pilot murine model suggests they could be used effectively to treat post-exposure, symptomatic human anthrax patients following a bioterrorism event. These results also indicate that recombinant PA83 coupled to NT-MDP is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies and suggest it would be a promising vaccine candidate for anthrax. The ease of production, ease of covalent attachment, and immunostimulatory activity of the NT-MDP indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations.","Kelly, Cassandra D; O'Loughlin, Chris; Gelder, Frank B; Peterson, Johnny W; Sower, Laurie E; Cirino, Nick M",J Immune Based Ther Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17953756/,36
627482,COVID-19 and the US response: accelerating health inequities,2020-06-03,"The 2019–2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019–2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019–2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019–2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","Zipfel, Casey M.; Bansal, Shweta",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511582/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047993,36

As a focused country to alleviate the epidemic impact, China implemented a range of public health interventions to prevent the disease from further transmission, including the pandemic lockdown in Wuhan and other cities. This paper establishes China’s mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic. This approach is successfully applied to a network of Chinese provinces and the epidemic strength is smoothly interpreted by flow maps. Through this node-to-node interpretation of transmission risks, both overall and detailed epidemic hazards are properly analyzed, which can provide valuable intervention advice during public health emergencies.","Chen, Haonan; He, Jing; Song, Wenhui; Wang, Lianchao; Wang, Jiabao; Chen, Yijin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232385/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242761,36

Viral glycoproteins have different receptor affinities and triggering mechanisms. We employed vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a BSL-2 enveloped virus that can incorporate non-native glycoproteins, to examine the entry efficiencies of diverse viral glycoproteins. To compare the glycoprotein-mediated entry efficiencies of VSV glycoprotein (G), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S), Ebola (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP), Lassa (LASV) GP, and Chikungunya (CHIKV) envelope (E) protein, we produced recombinant VSV (rVSV) viruses that produce the five glycoproteins. The rVSV virions encoded a nano luciferase (NLucP) reporter gene fused to a destabilization domain (PEST), which we used in combination with the live-cell substrate EndurazineTM to monitor viral entry kinetics in real time. Our data indicate that rVSV particles with glycoproteins that require more post-internalization priming typically demonstrate delayed entry in comparison to VSV G. In addition to determining the time required for each virus to complete entry, we also used our system to evaluate viral cell surface receptor preferences, monitor fusion, and elucidate endocytosis mechanisms. This system can be rapidly employed to examine diverse viral glycoproteins and their entry requirements.","Lay Mendoza, Maria Fernanda; Acciani, Marissa Danielle; Levit, Courtney Nina; Santa Maria, Christopher; Brindley, Melinda Ann",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12121457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348746/,36
629107,COVID-19 Vaccines Induce Severe Hemolysis in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria,2021-05-06,"Coronaviruses are commonly characterized by a unique discontinuous RNA transcriptional synthesis strategy guided by transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). However, the details of RNA synthesis in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present a time-scaled, gene-comparable transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that ACGAAC functions as a core TRS guiding the discontinuous RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 from a holistic perspective. During infection, viral transcription, rather than genome replication, dominates all viral RNA synthesis activities. The most highly expressed viral gene is the nucleocapsid gene, followed by ORF7 and ORF3 genes, while the envelope gene shows the lowest expression. Host transcription dysregulation keeps exacerbating after viral RNA synthesis reaches a maximum. The most enriched host pathways are metabolism related. Two of them (cholesterol and valine metabolism) affect viral replication in reverse. Furthermore, the activation of numerous cytokines emerges before large-scale viral RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current severe global health emergency that began at the end of 2019. Although the universal transcriptional strategies of coronaviruses are preliminarily understood, the details of RNA synthesis, especially the time-matched transcription level of each SARS-CoV-2 gene and the principles of subgenomic mRNA synthesis, are not clear. The coterminal subgenomic mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 present obstacles in identifying the expression of most genes by PCR-based methods, which are exacerbated by the lack of related antibodies. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-related metabolic imbalance and cytokine storm are receiving increasing attention from both clinical and mechanistic perspectives. Our transcriptomic research provides information on both viral RNA synthesis and host responses, in which the transcription-regulating sequences and transcription levels of viral genes are demonstrated, and the metabolic dysregulation and cytokine levels identified at the host cellular level support the development of novel medical treatment strategies.","Wang, Xuefeng; Zhao, Yudong; Yan, Feihu; Wang, Tiecheng; Sun, Weiyang; Feng, Na; Wang, Wenqi; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu; Gao, Yuwei",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106002/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00600-21,36
629135,Benzodiazepines: Their Use either as Essential Medicines or as Toxics Substances,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Older adults (aged ≥70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed. Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS: In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2 × 10(10) virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18–55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56–69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5–6·5 × 10(10) virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18–55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA(80)). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. FINDINGS: Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ≥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18–55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56–69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18–55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56–69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898–33 550], n=39; 56–69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233–40 353], n=26; and ≥70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705–37 796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA(80) at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 193 [IQR 113–238], n=39; 56–69 years, 144 [119–347], n=20; and ≥70 years, 161 [73–323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18–55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841–2428], n=24; 56–69 years: 797 SFCs [383–1817], n=29; and ≥70 years: 977 SFCs [458–1914], n=48). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.

Progressive paralytic neurological signs were observed in control and 75% of SC immunized mice, whereas only 20% of IC immunized mice exhibited symptoms. Neutralizing antibody titers in blood plasma were significantly elevated in SC and IC immunized mice, with the highest levels seen in IC immunized mice. Analysis of whole brain lysates revealed a strong induction of immunoglobulin in the brains of IC immunized mice that had virus neutralizing activity. Histopathological examination of brain tissue revealed mild encephalitis and disseminated viral antigen in control and SC immunized mice, but rare in IC immunized mice. These results suggest that IC immunization induces a preventive humoral immune response against intracerebrally inoculated rabies virus.

Hence it is of utmost importance to identify more therapeutics such as Chinese medicine formulae to meet the urgent need. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT), a Chinese medicine formula consisting of 21 herbs from five classical formulae has been reported to be efficacious on COVID-19 in 10 provinces in mainland China. QFPDT could prevent the progression from mild cases and shorten the average duration of symptoms and hospital stay. It has been recommended in the 6th and 7th versions of Clinical Practice Guideline on COVID-19 in China. The basic scientific studies, supported by network pharmacology, on the possible therapeutic targets of QFPDT and its constituent herbs including Ephedra sinica, Bupleurum chinense, Pogostemon cablin, Cinnamomum cassia, Scutellaria baicalensis were reviewed. The anti-oxidation, immuno-modulation and antiviral mechanisms through different pathways were collated. Two clusters of actions identified were cytokine storm prevention and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding regulation. The multi-target mechanisms of QFPDT for treating viral infection in general and COVID-19 in particular were validated. While large scale clinical studies on QFPDT are being conducted in China, one should use real world data for exploration of integrative treatment with inclusion of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and herb-drug interaction studies.","Zhong, Linda Li Dan; Lam, Wai Ching; Yang, Wei; Chan, Kam Wa; Sze, Stephen Cho Wing; Miao, Jiangxia; Yung, Ken Kin Lam; Bian, Zhaoxiang; Wong, Vivian Taam",Am J Chin Med,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0192415x20500512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668969/,36

631942,"HMGB1, NLRP3, IL-6 and ACE2 levels are elevated in COVID-19 with headache: a window to the infection-related headache mechanism",2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far affected over 41 million people globally. The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). METHODS: A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. RESULTS: Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness ≤5 days. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness ≤5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Gupta, Ankesh; Khurana, Surbhi; Das, Rojaleen; Srigyan, Deepankar; Singh, Amit; Mittal, Ankit; Singh, Parul; Soneja, Manish; Kumar, Arvind; Singh, Akhil Kant; Soni, Kapil Dev; Meena, Suneeta; Aggarwal, Richa; Sharad, Neha; Aggarwal, Anivita; Kadnur, Harshith; George, Netto; Singh, Komal; Desai, Devashish; Trilangi, Praveen; Khan, Adil Rashid; Kiro, Vandana V.; Naik, Shivdas; Arunan, Bharthi; Goel, Shivam; Patidar, Diksha; Lathwal, Amit; Dar, Lalit; Trikha, Anjan; Pandey, Ravindra Mohan; Malhotra, Rajesh; Guleria, Randeep; Mathur, Purva; Wig, Naveet",Indian J Med Res,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_3305_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818469/,36

Such treatment has superior penetration ability, high target specificity, and can overcome resistance conferred by the local microenvironment. Taken of these advantages, SACT has been endowed with an extensive application prospect in the past decade and attracted more and more attention. This review focusses on the current understanding of the mechanism of SACT, the interaction of sonodynamic action on different microbes, the factors affecting the efficacy of SACT, discusses the findings of recent works on SACT, and explores further prospects for SACT. Thus, a better understanding of sonodynamic killing facilitates the scientific community and industry personnel to establish a novel strategy to combat microbial burden.","Fan, Lihua; Idris Muhammad, Aliyu; Bilyaminu Ismail, Balarabe; Liu, Donghong",Ultrason Sonochem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2021.105591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082219/,36

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop, evaluate, and deploy an automatic natural language processing pipeline to collect user-generated Twitter data as a complementary resource for identifying potential cases of COVID-19 in the United States that are not based on testing and, thus, may not have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. METHODS: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out “reported speech” (eg, quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between March 1 and August 21, 2020. RESULTS: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644 (41%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen κ). A deep neural network classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related to COVID-19, achieved an F(1)-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76) for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19. Upon deploying our automatic pipeline, we identified 13,714 tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 and have US state–level geolocations. CONCLUSIONS: We have made the 13,714 tweets identified in this study, along with each tweet’s time stamp and US state–level geolocation, publicly available to download. This data set presents the opportunity for future work to assess the utility of Twitter data as a complementary resource for tracking the spread of COVID-19.","Klein, Ari Z; Magge, Arjun; O'Connor, Karen; Flores Amaro, Jesus Ivan; Weissenbacher, Davy; Gonzalez Hernandez, Graciela",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449904/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25314,36

We employed a design thinking tool called a customer journey to explore challenges and opportunities when using video communication software in the cardiology department of a regional hospital. Interviews were conducted with 5 patients with implanted devices, a nurse, an information technology manager and two cardiologists. Three lessons were identified based on these challenges and opportunities. Attention should be given to the ease of use of the technology, the meeting features, and the establishment of the connection between the cardiologist and the patient. Further, facilitating the role of an assistant (or virtual assistant) with the video consultation software who can manage the telehealth process may improve the success of video consultations. Employing design thinking to implement video consultations in cardiology and to further implement telehealth is crucial to build a resilient health care system that can address urgent needs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vandekerckhove, Pieter; Vandekerckhove, Yves; Tavernier, Rene; De Jaegher, Kelly; de Mul, Marleen",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/19771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519964/,36
633141,COVID-19 Vaccine Decisions: Considering the Choices and Opportunities,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is crucial for diagnosis of prior infection and predicting future immunity. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens. RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Muecksch, Frauke; Wise, Helen; Batchelor, Becky; Squires, Maria; Semple, Elizabeth; Richardson, Claire; McGuire, Jacqueline; Clearly, Sarah; Furrie, Elizabeth; Greig, Neil; Hay, Gordon; Templeton, Kate; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Jenks, Sara; Bieniasz, Paul D",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140086/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa659,36

An effective vaccine has not yet been developed against this virus, despite considerable efforts in basic and clinical research. HRSV replication is independent of the nuclear RNA processing constraints, since the virus genes are adapted to the cytoplasmic transcription, a process performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This study shows that meaningful nuclear RNA polymerase II dependent expression of the HRSV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) proteins can only be achieved with the optimization of their genes, and that the intracellular localization of N and P proteins changes when they are expressed out of the virus replication context. Immunization tests performed in mice resulted in the induction of humoral immunity using the optimized genes. This result was not observed for the non-optimized genes. In conclusion, optimization is a valuable tool for improving expression of HRSV genes in DNA vaccines.","Simabuco, Fernando M.; Tamura, Rodrigo E.; Carromeu, Cassiano; Farinha-Arcieri, Luis E.; Ventura, Armando M.",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.01.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19428575/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409000263; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409000263,36

Under such conditions, implementing new security measures not already in place is proving a challenge. The number of people working remotely has grown dramatically, and technology has enabled the continuation of some businesses that would otherwise have ground to a halt.

Research from the first two months of the pandemic suggests that a small proportion of people with OCD experienced worsening in their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, whereas the rest experienced either no change or an improvement in their symptoms. However, as society-level factors relating to the pandemic have evolved, the effects of the pandemic on people with OCD have likely changed as well, in complex and population-specific ways. Therefore, this study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people and demonstrates how differences across studies might emerge when studying specific populations at specific timepoints. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess how members of online OCD support communities felt the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their OCD symptoms, around 3 months after the pandemic began. METHODS: We recruited participants from online OCD support communities for our brief survey. Participants indicated how much they felt their OCD symptoms had changed since the pandemic began and how much they felt that having OCD was making it harder to deal with the pandemic. RESULTS: We collected survey data from June through August 2020 and received a total of 196 responses, some of which were partial responses. Among the nonmissing data, 65.9% (108/164) of the participants were from the United States and 90.5% (152/168) had been subjected to a stay-at-home order. In all, 92.9% (182/196) of the participants said they experienced worsening of their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, although the extent to which their symptoms worsened differed across dimensions of OCD; notably, symmetry and completeness symptoms were less likely to have worsened than others. Moreover, 95.5% (171/179) of the participants felt that having OCD made it difficult to deal with the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of online OCD support community members found a much higher rate of OCD symptom worsening than did other studies on people with OCD conducted during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as quarantine length, location, overlapping society-level challenges, and differing measurement and sampling choices may help to explain this difference across studies.","Kaveladze, Benjamin; Chang, Katherine; Siev, Jedidiah; Schueller, Stephen M",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595449/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26715,36

METHODS: During the 2017-2018 influenza season, patients with confirmed influenza or RSV infections were enrolled. Room air samples were collected close to (0.30 m) and far (2.20 m) from the patient’s head. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect and quantify viral particles in the air samples. Plaque assay was used to determine the infectiousness of the detected viruses. FINDINGS: Fifty-one air samples were collected from the rooms of 29 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza; 51% of the samples tested positive for influenza A virus (IAV). Among IAV-positive patients, 65% were emitters (have at least one positive air sample) reflecting a higher risk of nosocomial transmission compared to non-emitters. The majority (61.5%) of the IAV-positive air samples were collected at 0.3 m distance from the patients’ head, while the remaining were collected at 2.2 m. The positivity rate of IAV in air samplers was influenced by the distance from the patient’s head and the day of collection post-hospital admission. Only three patients with RSV infection were recruited and none were emitters. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that influenza can be aerosolized beyond one meter in patient rooms, a distance considered to be safe by infection control practices.

639411,Covid-19: 40% of patients with weakened immune system mount lower response to vaccines.,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal Dysphagia (OD) and malnutrition are frequently reported conditions in nursing home residents, and are often interrelated. Best care for dysphagic residents with, or at risk of, malnutrition should target adequate nutritional intake and the safety and efficacy of swallowing. The effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) suitable for nursing home residents with concurrent OD and malnutrition (risk) on nutritional status has not been investigated before. The current study aims to investigate the effect of daily use of a range of pre-thickened ONS on the body weight of nursing home residents with OD and malnutrition (risk) compared to standard OD and nutritional care. METHODS / DESIGN: The DYNAMO study is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open label trial with two parallel groups. Study participants will be recruited in nursing homes of several care organizations in the south of the Netherlands. Study duration is 12 weeks. Residents in the control group will receive standard OD and nutritional care, and residents in the test group will receive standard OD and nutritional care with extra daily supplementation of pre-thickened ONS. The main outcome parameter is the difference in body weight change between the control and test groups. An a priori estimation of the required sample size per group (control / test) totals 78. Other outcome parameters are differences in: nutritional intake, health-related quality of life, OD-specific quality of life, activities of daily living, vital signs, and blood nutrient and metabolite levels. DISCUSSION: Regular ONS could address the nutritional needs of nursing home residents with malnutrition (risk), but might be too thin and unsafe for residents with OD. Pre-thickened ONS is suitable for residents with OD. It offers the advantage of being a ready-to-use amylase-resistant product available in several consistencies which are able to increase swallowing efficacy and safety. The DYNAMO study is the first to investigate the effects of pre-thickened ONS on nutritional status in nursing home residents with concurrent OD and malnutrition (risk).

Although, as suggested by previous studies, some medical students have already volunteered to serve during the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall willingness of Chinese medical students to volunteer for such has not been systematically examined. AIM: To study Chinese medical students’ interest in the relevant knowledge on COVID-19 and what roles they want to play in the pandemic. METHODS: Medical students at Peking Union Medical College were surveyed via a web-based questionnaire to obtain data on the extent of interest in the relevant knowledge on COVID-19, attitude towards volunteerism in the pandemic, and career preference. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate possible factors that could encourage volunteerism among this group in a pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 552 medical students responded. Most medical students showed a huge interest in COVID-19. The extent of students’ interest in COVID-19 varied among different student-classes (P < 0.05). Senior students had higher scores than the other two classes. The number of people who were ‘glad to volunteer’ in COVID-19 represented 85.6% of the respondents. What these students expressed willingness to undertake involved direct, indirect, and administrative job activities. Logistic regression analysis identified two factors that negatively influenced volunteering in the pandemic: Student-class and hazards of the voluntary job. Factors that positively influenced volunteering were time to watch COVID-19 news, predictable impact on China, and moral responsibility. CONCLUSION: More innovative methods can be explored to increase Chinese medical students’ interest in reading about the relevant knowledge on COVID-19 and doing voluntary jobs during the pandemic.","Yu, Nan-Ze; Li, Zhi-Jin; Chong, Yu-Ming; Xu, Yuan; Fan, Jun-Ping; Yang, Yang; Teng, Yue; Zhang, Yu-Wei; Zhang, Wen-Chao; Zhang, Ming-Zi; Huang, Jiu-Zuo; Wang, Xiao-Jun; Zhang, Shu-Yang; Long, Xiao",World J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024718/; https://doi.org/10.5501/wjv.v9.i3.38,36
640374,"Anticipating the curve: can online symptom-based data reflect COVID-19 case activity in Ontario, Canada?",2021-01-15,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 has had a huge impact on people’s daily life. Many restaurant businesses have been greatly affected by it. Consumers’ preferences for catering industry in China have changed, such as environmental hygiene, variety of dishes, and service methods. Therefore, the analysis of consumer preference differences and changes before and after the epidemic can not only provide emergency strategies for the catering industry but further improve the catering industry’s ability to deal with public health emergencies. This paper takes five cities in China as representatives to explore the impact of COVID-19 on China’s catering industry. Based on catering review data from August 2019 to April 2020, this paper first carries out Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic analysis and SNOWNLP (A Python library for processing Chinese text) sentiment analysis. Then this paper compares the results of topic classification and sentiment analysis before and after the epidemic. Furthermore, differences and changes of consumer preferences are obtained and preferences of consumers under COVID-19 are analyzed and forecasted. The results of LDA thematic analysis before the outbreak of COVID-19 show that consumers tend to punch in cyber celebrity restaurants and pay more attention to the taste of dishes, whereas after it consumers pay more attention to the changes of dishes, dining environment as well as epidemic prevention. The number of packages and takeout was also increasing. However, the waiting time is constantly considered by consumers before and after COVID-19. Firstly, to our surprise, final outcome of emotional analysis showed that consumers’ emotional state was more positive after the epidemic than before. COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle of consumers, consumption concepts, and consumption habits. Therefore, businesses also need to take positive and flexible measures to actively get feedback from consumers to adjust dishes and business methods. Secondly, the psychological attitude of catering consumers is relatively positive during the epidemic period, which indicates that consumers have great confidence in the recovery and development of the catering industry. Businesses can comply with consumers’ psychology and combine consumption vouchers with restaurant discounts to promote consumers’ consumption. Finally, the environment and service play more and more important effect on consumers’ emotional scores at present, which indicates that dining state and comfortable mealtime environment are becoming increasingly valuable. Therefore, businesses need to improve service standards.","Zhang, Chenyu; Jiang, Jiayue; Jin, Hong; Chen, Tinggui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920875/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084178,36
640637,The utility of beta-2-microglobulin testing as a human cellular control in COVID-19 testing,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: The new Coronavirus identified in Whuan at the end of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Beta Coronavirus genus and is responsible for the new Coronavirus 2019 pandemia (COVID-19). Infected children may be asymptomatic or present fever, dry cough, fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms. The CDC recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 children (the majority < 5 years of age) were referred, to our Pediatric Department, as possible cases of COVID-19 infection. Blood analysis, chest X-ray, and naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens for viral identification of COVID-19 were requested. RESULTS: None of the screened children resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%). An high C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively. Almost half of patients (45.2%) required hospitalization in our Pediatric Unit and one patient in Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition criteria is essential for clinical management and outbreak control. Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults, as reported in our preliminary survey. Further studies are needed to confirm our observations.

The researcher prepared a psychological service providers' empowerment scale that consisted of 28 items, and this scale was applied in a random sample consisting of 975 psychological service providers. The results showed that the empowerment scale has acceptable validity and reliability. The results of the exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 28 scale items saturate on seven factors, which accounted for 64.42% of the total variance of the scale: the first factor named expect psychological services effectiveness accounted for 27.86%, the second factor named self‐stimulation accounted for 9.71%, the third factor named responsibilities and duties accounted for 7.12%, the fourth factor named psychological services work environment accounted for 6.51%, the fifth factor named psychological service providers’ decision‐making accounted for 5.37%, the sixth factor named creative psychological service provider behaviour accounted for 4.45%, and the seventh factor named psychological services confidence accounted for 3.82% of the total variance of a psychological service providers' empowerment. In order to study the ability to predict the empowerment among psychological service providers, the researcher developed a structural model for psychological service providers' empowerment and then used the structural equation model analysis. The results showed that the proposed structural model of a psychological service providers' empowerment has goodness‐of‐fit, and these results emphasised the ability to predict psychological service providers' empowerment by seven tested factors.","Arnout, Boshra A.",Couns Psychother Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162833/; https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12328,36
640915,Organoid technology demonstrates effects of potential drugs for COVID‐19 on the lung regeneration,2020-10-19,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (named by the World Health Organization, WHO), has spread widely since the end of 2019. Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CL(pro) or M(pro)), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic.","Zhou, Jin; Huang, Jie",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719799/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00589,36

PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop the Parental Attitude Scale-Protecting Children during COVID-19 (PAS-CV19S) and assess its psychometric properties. This study also aimed to determine the relationship between parental attitudes about COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this methodological and correlational study, parents of children ages 6 to 18 years old were included (N = 402). The PAS-CV19S was developed for this study. The study collected data using an online sociodemographic form, a fear of COVID-19 scale, and the PAS-CV19S. The Cronbach alpha coefficient, confirmatory factor analysis, and explanatory factor analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of PAS-CV19S. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 scale and the PAS-CV19S. RESULTS: The PAS-CV19S is a valid and reliable scale consisting of three factors (general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors) as subdimensions. The Cronbach alpha of the PAS-CV19S overall was 0.90; the Cronbach alphas for the general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors subdimensions were 0.78, 0.80, and 0.92, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between fear of COVID-19 and the mental health subdimension. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study sheds light on parental attitudes about protecting their children from COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 of parents did not affect attitudes other than mental health.

641645,COVID-19 prevalence estimation by random sampling in population - optimal sample pooling under varying assumptions about true prevalence,2020-07-23,"Antiviral antisepsis and disinfection are crucial for preventing the environmental spread of viral infections. Emerging viruses and associated diseases, as well as nosocomial viral infections, have become a real issue in medical fields, and there are very few efficient and specific treatments available to fight most of these infections. Another issue is the potential environmental resistance and spread of viral particles. Therefore, it is essential to properly evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics‐disinfectants (ATS‐D) on viruses. ATS‐D antiviral activity is evaluated by (1) combining viruses and test product for an appropriately defined and precise contact time, (2) neutralizing product activity, and (3) estimating the loss of viral infectivity. A germicide can be considered to have an efficient ATS‐D antiviral activity if it induces a >3 or >4 log(10) reduction (American and European regulatory agency requirements, respectively) in viral titers in a defined contact time. This unit describes a global methodology for evaluating chemical ATS‐D antiviral activity. Curr. Protoc.

Traditional/natural medicine, already experienced by humans, could be an earlier solution. Considering the research team’s experience in using nano-clays as high-affinity material for cancer metastasis, melanoma treatment, and bone regeneration, we propose to use these nano-clays for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19. Owing to high affinity, nano-clays would capture the viruses before the latter get engaged with human hACE2. In this study, molecular-level simulations and modeling of the interaction of coronavirus spike and hACE2 proteins were performed with and without nano-clays. The results showed a very high level of affinity/cohesiveness among SARS-CoV-2 spike and nano-clays as compared to the one between the former and hACE2. We premise that these nano-clays since already being used as drug carriers could also be injected as “clays-alone” medicine.

We aimed to estimate the population-based seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco at the end of the first wave. Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in September 2020 in three settings in Cusco: (1) Cusco city at 3300 meters above the sea level (m.a.s.l.), (2) the periphery of Cusco (Santiago, San Jeronimo, San Sebastian, and Wanchaq) at 3300 m.a.s.l., and (3) Quillabamba city, located at 1050 m.a.s.l. People aged greater than or equal 18 years within a family unit were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on identifying total antibodies (IgM and IgG) anti- SARS-CoV-2 in serum using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence test. Findings: We enrolled 1924 participants from 712 families. Of the total, 637 participants were COVID-19 seropositive. Seroprevalence was 38.8% (95%CI: 33.4%-44.9%) in Cusco city, 34.9% (95%CI: 30.4%-40.1%) in the periphery of Cusco, and 20.3% (95%CI: 16.2%-25.6%) in Quillabamba. In 141 families (19.8%; 95%CI: 17.0%-22.8%) the whole members were positive to the test. Living with more than three persons in the same house, a positive COVID-19 case at home, and a member who died in the last five months were factors associated with COVID-19 positivity. The smell/taste alteration was the symptom most associated with seropositivity (aOR= 14.27, 95% CI: 8.24-24.70); whereas always wearing a face shield (aOR= 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46- 0.84) or a facial mask (aOR= 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.88) reduced that probability. Interpretation: Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco was high, with significant differences between settings. Wearing masks and face shields were associated with lower rate of infection; however, efforts must be made to sustain them over time since there is still a high proportion of susceptible people.

643061,"COVID-19 Transmission, Current Treatment, and Future Therapeutic Strategies",2021-01-19,"Background Early papers on the mental health of the public during the Covid-19 pandemic surveyed participants from China. Outside of China, Iran has emerged as one of the most affected countries with a high death count and rate. The paper presents the first empirical evidence from Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic on their level of distress and its predictors. Methods On March 25-28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Findings The distress level of Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China. Interpretation Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.

643337,Is tracking and modeling Covid-19 infection dynamics for Bangladesh using daily data feasible?,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: There is a strong need to improve medication adherence (MA) for individuals with hypertension in order to reduce long-term hospitalization costs. We believe this can be achieved through an artificial intelligence agent that helps the patient in understanding key individual adherence risk factors and designing an appropriate intervention plan. The incidence of hypertension in Sweden is estimated at approximately 27%. Although blood pressure control has increased in Sweden, barely half of the treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure levels. It is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke as well as heart failure. MA is a key factor for good clinical outcomes in persons with hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to design, develop, test, and evaluate an adaptive digital intervention called iMedA, delivered via a mobile app to improve MA, self-care management, and blood pressure control for persons with hypertension. METHODS: The study design is an interrupted time series. We will collect data on a daily basis, 14 days before, during 6 months of delivering digital interventions through the mobile app, and 14 days after. The effect will be analyzed using segmented regression analysis. The participants will be recruited in Region Halland, Sweden. The design of the digital interventions follows the just-in-time adaptive intervention framework. The primary (distal) outcome is MA, and the secondary outcome is blood pressure. The design of the digital intervention is developed based on a needs assessment process including a systematic review, focus group interviews, and a pilot study, before conducting the longitudinal interrupted time series study. RESULTS: The focus groups of persons with hypertension have been conducted to perform the needs assessment in a Swedish context. The design and development of digital interventions are in progress, and the interventions are planned to be ready in November 2020. Then, the 2-week pilot study for usability evaluation will start, and the interrupted time series study, which we plan to start in February 2021, will follow it. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that iMedA will improve medication adherence and self-care management. This study could illustrate how self-care management tools can be an additional (digital) treatment support to a clinical one without increasing burden on health care staff.

Participants were UK frontline doctors specialising in Emergency Medicine, Anaesthetics, or Intensive Care (n = 31) purposively sampled for maximum variation on gender, specialty, ethnicity, and trauma-related distress; most worked in ICU during the pandemic (71%). Four themes were derived: (1) ‘coping strategies’, participants used many, including exercise, mindfulness, and “wait until it gets really bad”; (2) ‘sources of support’, participants valued embedded psychological support, digital services, and informal conversations with colleagues or family, though there was little opportunity; (3) ‘organisational influences on wellbeing’, participants reported a love–hate relationship for concepts like ‘wellbeing’, seen as important but insulting when basic workplace needs were unmet; (4) ‘improving engagement with support’, analysis suggests we must reduce physical and psychological barriers to access and encourage leaders to model psychologically supportive behaviours.

643568,A qualitative study exploring the relationship between mothers' vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs with COVID-19 vaccination intention and prevention during the early pandemic months,2021,"Early life stress compromises brain development and can contribute to the development of mental illnesses. A common animal model used to study different facets of psychiatric disorders is social isolation from early life on. In rats, this isolation can induce long-lasting alterations in molecular expression and in behavior. Since social isolation models severe psychiatric symptoms, it is to be expected that it affects the overall wellbeing of the animals. As also promoted by the 3Rs principle, though, it is pivotal to decrease the burden of laboratory animals by limiting the number of subjects (reduce, replace) and by improving the animals’ wellbeing (refine). The aim of this study was therefore to test possible refinement strategies such as resocialization and mere adult social isolation. We examined whether the alternatives still triggered the necessary phenotype while minimizing the stress load on the animals. Interestingly, we did not find reduced wellbeing-associated burrowing performance in isolated rats. The hyperactive phenotype seen in socially isolated animals was observed for rats undergoing the adult-only isolation, but resocializing ameliorated the locomotor abnormality. Isolation strongly affected markers of neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex independent of timing: mRNA levels of Arc, Bdnf and the pool of Bdnf transcripts with the 3’ long UTR were reduced in all groups. Bdnf splice variant IV expression was reduced in lifelong-isolated animals. Some of these deficits normalized after resocialization; likewise, exon VI Bdnf mRNA levels were reduced only in animals persistently isolated. Conversely, social deprivation did not affect the expression of Gad67 and Pvb, two GABAergic markers, whereas changes occurred in the expression of dopamine d1 and d2 receptors. As adult isolation was sufficient to trigger the hyperactive phenotype and impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex, it could be a candidate for a refinement strategy for certain research questions. To fully grade the severity of post-weaning social isolation and the alternatives, adult isolation and resocialization, a more profound and multimodal assessment approach is necessary.","Begni, Veronica; Sanson, Alice; Pfeiffer, Natascha; Brandwein, Christiane; Inta, Dragos; Talbot, Steven R.; Riva, Marco Andrea; Gass, Peter; Mallien, Anne Stephanie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108362/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240439,36

However, effective, safe treatments typically take over a decade to develop and there are still no clinically approved therapies to treat highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Repurposing of known drugs can speed up development and this strategy, along with the use of biologicals (notably monoclonal antibody therapy) and vaccine development programmes remain the principal routes to dealing with the immediate impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the development of broadly-effective highly potent antivirals should be a major longer term goal. Structural biology has been applied with enormous effect, with key proteins structurally characterised only weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was released. Open-access to advanced infrastructure for structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and high-end cryo-EM and NMR centres has brought these technologies centre-stage in drug discovery.

643864,The Surge in Covid related Mucormycosis,2021-06-12,"To combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma’s accuracy far exceeds that of simple “yes-no” questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19.

643992,Ambulatory day case oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgery during the peak of COVID 19 pandemic,2021-02-28,"INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence documented the critical impacts of vitamin D (VD) in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The functions of VD are dependent on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the VD/VDR signaling pathway. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association of VDR gene polymorphisms with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: In the present study, eight VDR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 500 COVID-19 patients in Iran, including 160 asymptomatic, 250 mild/moderate, and 90 severe/critical cases. The association of these polymorphisms with severity, clinical outcomes, and comorbidities were evaluated through the calculation of the Odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Interestingly, significant associations were disclosed for some of the SNP-related alleles and/or genotypes in one or more genetic models with different clinical data in COVID-19 patients. Significant association of VDR-SNPs with signs, symptoms, and comorbidities was as follows: ApaI with shortness of breath (P ˂ 0.001) and asthma (P = 0.034) in severe/critical patients (group III); BsmI with chronic renal disease (P = 0.010) in mild/moderate patients (group II); Tru9I with vomiting (P = 0.031), shortness of breath (P = 0.04), and hypertension (P = 0.030); FokI with fever and hypertension (P = 0.027) in severe/critical patients (group III); CDX2 with shortness of breath (P = 0.022), hypertension (P = 0.036), and diabetes (P = 0.042) in severe/critical patients (group III); EcoRV with diabetes (P ˂ 0.001 and P = 0.045 in mild/moderate patients (group II) and severe/critical patients (group III), respectively). However, the association of VDR TaqI and BglI polymorphisms with clinical symptoms and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was not significant. CONCLUSION: VDR gene polymorphisms might play critical roles in the vulnerability to infection and severity of COVID-19, probably by altering the risk of comorbidities. However, these results require further validation in larger studies with different ethnicities and geographical regions.","Abdollahzadeh, Rasoul; Shushizadeh, Mohammad Hossein; Barazandehrokh, Mina; Choopani, Sepideh; Azarnezhad, Asaad; Paknahad, Sahereh; Pirhoushiaran, Maryam; Makani, S.

However, their development in infected patients remains unclear. Here, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to probe the dynamic development of a potent and protective ZIKV E DIII-specific antibody ZK2B10 isolated from a ZIKV convalescent individual. The unbiased repertoire analysis showed dramatic changes in the usage of antibody variable region germline genes. However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic hypermutation and transient expansion during the 12 months following the onset of symptoms. The NGS-derived, germline-like ZK2B10 somatic variants neutralized ZIKV potently and protected mice from lethal challenge of ZIKV without detectable cross-reactivity with Dengue virus (DENV). Site-directed mutagenesis identified two residues within the λ chain, N31 and S91, that are essential to the functional maturation of ZK2B10. The repertoire and lineage features unveiled here will help elucidate the developmental process and protective potential of E DIII-directed antibodies against ZIKV infection.","Gao, Fei; Lin, Xiaohe; He, Linling; Wang, Ruoke; Wang, Han; Shi, Xuanling; Zhang, Fuchun; Yin, Chibiao; Zhang, Linqi; Zhu, Jiang; Yu, Lei",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31708914/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02424,36
646104,Lung Fibrosis after COVID-19: Treatment Prospects,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: While pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) appears to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), data on patients with CVD and concomitant cancer is limited. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19. METHODS: Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested. RESULTS: Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07–6.24; p < 0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01—1.76; p = 0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.05–2.80; p = 0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99—1.41; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.","Tehrani, David M.; Wang, Xiaoyan; Rafique, Asim M.; Hayek, Salim S.; Herrmann, Joerg; Neilan, Tomas G.; Desai, Pooja; Morgans, Alicia; Lopez-Mattei, Juan; Parikh, Rushi V.; Yang, Eric H.",Cardiooncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40959-021-00113-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372948/,36

The economics of gateways and hubs depends on the competitiveness of their trade corridors. Trade corridor routes are determined by geophysical features, political borders, proximity to markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure. The advantages of location can be altered by changes in transportation and communications technologies that favor some locations at the expense of others. Over time, hierarchies of hub and gateway cities have formed based on their trade of goods and increasingly on the services they provide.

We examined sensation seeking (SS), anxiety sensitivity (AS), impulsivity, and hopelessness as traits potentially associated with non-adherence and distress in response to COVID-19. Furthermore, we sought to understand if known sex differences in SS (male>female) and AS (female>male) may explain sex differences on these two COVID-19 outcomes. In the first month of the pandemic, 400 adults (mean age = 32.16 years; 45.3%F) completed the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale to assess personality. Degree of adherence to public health recommendations and COVID-19-related distress were also measured. Male sex was indirectly related to poorer adherence to stay-at-home advisories via SS, and female sex was indirectly related to higher COVID-19 distress via AS.

647441,Long-Term Brain Disorders in Post Covid-19 Neurological Syndrome (PCNS) Patient,2021-04-02,"OBJECTIVES: Therapies for patients with respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 are urgently needed. Early implementation of prone positioning ventilation improves survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but studies examining the effect of proning on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are lacking. Our objective was to estimate the effect of early proning initiation on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated respiratory failure. DESIGN: Data were derived from the Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a multicenter cohort study of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to 68 U.S. hospitals. Using these data, we emulated a target trial of prone positioning ventilation by categorizing mechanically ventilated hypoxemic (ratio of Pao2 over the corresponding Fio2 &#8804; 200 mm Hg) patients as having been initiated on proning or not within 2 days of ICU admission. We fit an inverse probability-weighted Cox model to estimate the mortality hazard ratio for early proning versus no early proning. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge, or end of follow-up. SETTING: ICUs at 68 U.S. sites. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with ratio of Pao2 over the corresponding Fio2 less than or equal to 200 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,338 eligible patients, 702 (30.0%) were proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission. After inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity of illness characteristics were well-balanced between groups. A total of 1,017 (43.5%) of the 2,338 patients were discharged alive, 1,101 (47.1%) died, and 220 (9.4%) were still hospitalized at last follow-up. Patients proned within the first 2 days of ICU admission had a lower adjusted risk of death compared with nonproned patients (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality was lower in mechanically ventilated hypoxemic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 treated with early proning compared with patients whose treatment did not include early proning.","Mathews, Kusum S; Soh, Howard; Shaefi, Shahzad; Wang, Wei; Bose, Sonali; Coca, Steven; Gupta, Shruti; Hayek, Salim S; Srivastava, Anand; Brenner, Samantha K; Radbel, Jared; Green, Adam; Sutherland, Anne; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Shehata, Alexandre; Schenck, Edward J; Short, Samuel A P; Hernán, Miguel A; Chan, Lili; Leaf, David E",Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595960/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004938,36

We assessed the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) antibodies in patients with SLE and RA and patient behavior, disease‐related symptoms, and mental health. METHODS: More than 900 participants were included: 405 patients with RA or SLE (CRD‐patients) and 513 blood donors. All participants had blood SARS‐CoV‐2 total antibodies measured (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 99.5%) and answered a questionnaire concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ‐9). The CRD patients were further asked about physical activity, adherence to medication, and disease‐related symptoms. RESULTS: CRD‐patients had a significant lower seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies (n=1/365, 0.3%) compared to blood donors (n=10/513, 1.9%) (p=0.03). Almost 60% of patients were unable to exercise as usual, increased pain was experienced by 34% of patients and increased disease activity by 24%. Almost 10% of patients reduced or discontinued their immunosuppressive treatments at their own initiative. Symptoms of moderate depression were present in 19% of patients compared to 6,8% blood donors (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low seroprevalence in patients with CRDs indicates successful mitigation of exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2. However, this appears to occur at the expense of physical activity, experience of increased pain, disease activity, and symptoms of depression. There is a need for care providers to be aware of these negative side‐effects and for further studies to investigate the possible long‐term consequences.","Ammitzbøll, Christian; Andersen, Jakob Bøgh; Vils, Signe Risbøl; Mistegaard, Clara Elbæk; Mikkelsen, Susan; Erikstrup, Christian; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Hauge, Ellen‐Margrethe; Troldborg, Anne",Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.24716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057311/,36

METHODS: This study used a mixed-method approach. The first phase implemented a survey that targeted both academic staff and students to evaluate their experiences with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a focus group discussion was conducted to explore, in-depth, their experience. The survey consisted of five domains as follows: readiness for the shift to distance education during the full and partial lockdown, perception towards distance education, barriers against distance education, and the acquisitions due to distance education. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess participants’ responses to the different domains (mean score ± standard deviation). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the academic staff and 65% of the students responded to the survey. Participants’ views were positive for readiness for the shift to distance education during the full lockdown (3.89±0.42 for academic staff and 3.82±0.50 for students) with almost similar evaluation for the readiness during the blended learning period (3.91±0.44 for staff and 3.83±0.59 for students). The findings showed a generally positive perception towards distance education (3.59± 0.67 for academic staff and 3.47±0.64 for students). The acquisitions due to distance education were also positive (3.95±0.72 for academic staff and 3.78±0.77 for students). Nonetheless, some barriers that affected distance education were raised with an overall neutral view from both academic staff (3.31±0.72) and students (3.31±0.64), with different responses for the individual items. Qualitative findings from the focus group discussions explored the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges, with emphasis on the areas for improvement.

This retrospective study presents the clinical, laboratory, and radiological profiles, treatments, and outcomes of atypical COVID-19 patients without respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. The study examined ten atypical patients out of 909 severe or critical patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus between 25 January 2020 and 10 February 2020. Data were obtained from the electronic medical records of severe or critical patients without respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Among 943 COVID-19 patients, 909 (96.4%) were severe or critical type. Of the severe or critical patients, ten (1.1%) presented without respiratory symptoms or fever at admission. The median age of the ten participants was 63 years (interquartile range (IQR): 57–72), and seven participants were men. The median time from symptom onset to admission was 14 d (IQR: 7–20). Eight of the ten patients had chronic diseases. The patients had fatigue (n = 5), headache or dizziness (n = 4), diarrhea (n = 5), anorexia (n = 3), nausea or vomiting (n = 3), and eye discomfort (n = 1).

Eventually, two patients died and eight were discharged. In the discharged patients, the median time from admission to discharge lasted 24 d (IQR: 13–43). In summary, some severe or critical COVID-19 patients were found to have no respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. All such atypical cases should be identified and quarantined as early as possible, since they tend to have a prolonged hospital stay or fatal outcomes.

However, little is known about the characteristics of PEx managed on an outpatient basis and the effectiveness of oral antibiotic therapy. We sought to prospectively evaluate clinical and laboratory changes associated with oral antibiotic treatment for PEx. METHODS: Children with CF between 8 and 18 years of age prescribed two weeks of oral antibiotics for a PEx were eligible to enroll. The study consisted of a visit within 48 h of starting antibiotics and a second visit within one week of antibiotic completion. Twenty-eight participants were evaluated by exacerbation score, quality of life measurements, lung function, sputum microbiology and inflammation. RESULTS: Oral antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant improvement in exacerbation score and quality of life measured by the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain. Following treatment, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) % predicted increased [median (range)] 9% (−8%, 31%), and 22 (81%) subjects returned to 90% or higher of baseline FEV(1).

651899,"ARIA‐EAACI statement on Asthma and COVID‐19 (June 2, 2020)",2020-06-26,"Apoptotic cell death is executed by the caspase-mediated cleavage of various vital proteins. Elucidating the consequences of this endoproteolytic cleavage is crucial for our understanding of cell death and other biological processes. Many caspase substrates are just cleaved as bystanders, because they happen to contain a caspase cleavage site in their sequence. Several targets, however, have a discrete function in propagation of the cell death process. Many structural and regulatory proteins are inactivated by caspases, while other substrates can be activated. In most cases, the consequences of this gain-of-function are poorly understood. Caspase substrates can regulate the key morphological changes in apoptosis. Several caspase substrates also act as transducers and amplifiers that determine the apoptotic threshold and cell fate. This review summarizes the known caspase substrates comprising a bewildering list of more than 280 different proteins. We highlight some recent aspects inferred by the cleavage of certain proteins in apoptosis. We also discuss emerging themes of caspase cleavage in other forms of cell death and, in particular, in apparently unrelated processes, such as cell cycle regulation and cellular differentiation.","Fischer, U; Jänicke, R U; Schulze-Osthoff, K",Cell Death Differ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12655297/,36

Two Southern Ontario cases are examined: an area level water disaster and cumulative change at the regional level. The role of disaster incubation analysis and advanced environmental assessment tools are discussed in terms of their potential to contribute to more enlightened and effective assessment and planning processes. It is concluded that conventional approaches to EA and planning are characteristically deficient in addressing the full range of impacts and risks, and particularly those originating from pathogens, dispersed and insidious sources. Rigorous application of disaster incubation analysis and more advanced forms of EA has considerable potential to influence a different pattern of planning and decision making.","Mulvihill, Peter R.; Ali, S.

We discuss which strategies have been assessed immunologically and which have been evaluated in SARS coronavirus challenge models. We discuss inactivated vaccines, virally and bacterially vectored vaccines, recombinant protein and DNA vaccines, as well as the use of attenuated vaccines. Data regarding the correlates of protection, animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of SARS disease are discussed. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Current data suggest that intranasal vaccination may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against SARS in humans.","Roper, Rachel L; Rehm, Kristina E",Expert Rev Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19538115/; https://doi.org/10.1586/erv.09.43,36
652756,Clinical leadership training: a clinician's perspective,2020-10-13,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic followed a unique trajectory in Eastern Europe compared to other heavily affected regions, with most countries there only experiencing a major surge of cases and deaths towards the end of 2020 after a relatively uneventful first half of the year. However, the consequences of that surge have not received as much attention as the situation in Western countries. Bulgaria, even though it has been one of the most heavily affected countries, has been one of those neglected cases. Methods: We use mortality and mobility data from Eurostat, official governmental and other sources to examine the development and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and other European countries. Results: We find a very high level of excess mortality in Eastern European countries measured by several metrics including excess mortality rate (EMR), P-scores and potential years of life lost. By the last metric Eastern Europe emerges as the hardest hit region by the pandemic in Europe in 2020. With a record EMR at ~0.25% and a strikingly large and mostly unique to it mortality rate in the working age demographics, Bulgaria emerges as one of the most affected countries in Eastern Europe. The high excess mortality in Bulgaria correlates with insufficient intensity of testing and with delayed imposition of lockdown measures. We also find major geographic and demographic disparities within the country, with considerably lower mortality observed in major cities relative to more remote areas (likely due to disparities in the availability of medical resources). Analysis of the course of the epidemic revealed that individual mobility measures were predictive of the eventual decline in cases and deaths. However, while mobility declined as a result of the imposition of a lockdown, it already trended downwards before such measures were introduced, which resulted in a reduction of deaths independent of the effect of restrictions. Conclusions: Large excess mortality and high numbers of potential years of life lost are observed as a result of the COVID pandemic in Bulgaria, as well as in several other countries in Eastern Europe. Significant delays in the imposition of stringent mobility-reducing measures combined with a lack of medical resources likely caused a substantial loss of life, including in the working age population.","Rangachev, A.; Marinov, G.; Mladenov, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.06.21254958; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.06.21254958v1?rss=1,36

The disease as at the point of writing this paper has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence, big data, and similar methodologies are potential tools to predict the extent of the spread and effectiveness of containment strategies to stem the transmission of this disease. In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor. Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours. The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH).

653536,Elucidation of Teicoplanin Interactions with Drug Targets Related to COVID-19,2021-07-15,"In December 2019, physicians reported numerous patients showing pneumonia of unknown origin in the Chinese region of Wuhan. Following the spreading of the infection over the world, The World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 declared the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a global pandemic. The scientific community is exerting an extraordinary effort to elucidate all aspects related to SARS-CoV-2, such as the structure, ultrastructure, invasion mechanisms, replication mechanisms, or drugs for treatment, mainly through in vitro studies. Thus, the clinical in vivo data can provide a test bench for new discoveries in the field of SARS-CoV-2, finding new solutions to fight the current pandemic. During this dramatic situation, the normal scientific protocols for the development of new diagnostic procedures or drugs are frequently not completely applied in order to speed up these processes. In this context, interdisciplinarity is fundamental. Specifically, a great contribution can be provided by the association and interpretation of data derived from medical disciplines based on the study of images, such as radiology, nuclear medicine, and pathology. Therefore, here, we highlighted the most recent histopathological and imaging data concerning the SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung and other human organs such as the kidney, heart, and vascular system. In addition, we evaluated the possible matches among data of radiology, nuclear medicine, and pathology departments in order to support the intense scientific work to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this regard, the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that are capable of correlating these clinical data with the new scientific discoveries concerning SARS-CoV-2 might be the keystone to get out of the pandemic.","Scimeca, Manuel; Urbano, Nicoletta; Bonfiglio, Rita; Montanaro, Manuela; Bonanno, Elena; Schillaci, Orazio; Mauriello, Alessandro",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971906/,36

The resource provides an informative and efficient setting for collecting data on the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In early March 2020, a questionnaire was developed in collaboration with other longitudinal population studies to ensure cross-cohort comparability. It targeted retrospective and current COVID-19 infection information (exposure assessment, symptom tracking and reported clinical outcomes) and the impact of both disease and mitigating measures implemented to manage the COVID-19 crisis more broadly. Data were collected on symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal flu, travel prior to the pandemic, mental health and social, behavioural and lifestyle factors. The online questionnaire was deployed across parent (G0) and offspring (G1) generations between 9 (th) April and 15 (th) May 2020. 6807 participants completed the questionnaire (2706 original mothers, 1014 original fathers/partners, 2973 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 114 offspring partners). Eight (0.01%) participants (4 G0 and 4 G1) reported a positive test for COVID-19, 77 (1.13%; 28 G0 and 49 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 865 (12.7%; 426 G0 and 439 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19. Using algorithmically defined cases, we estimate that the predicted proportion of COVID-19 cases ranged from 1.03% - 4.19% depending on timing during the period of reporting (October 2019-March 2020). Data from this first questionnaire will be complemented with at least two more follow-up questionnaires, linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available.

Identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 T cell epitopes and generation of peptide‐HLA tetramers facilitates direct ex vivo analyses of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells and their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. We utilized a combination of peptide prediction and in vitro peptide stimulation to validate novel SARS‐CoV‐2 epitopes restricted by HLA‐A*24:02, one of the most prominent HLA class I alleles, especially in Indigenous and Asian populations. Of the peptides screened, three spike‐derived peptides generated CD8(+)IFN‐γ(+) responses above background, S(1208‐1216) (QYIKWPWYI), S(448‐456) (NYNYLYRLF) and S(193‐201) (VFKNIDGYF), with S(1208) generating immunodominant CD8(+)IFN‐γ(+) responses. Using peptide‐HLA‐I tetramers, we performed direct ex vivo tetramer enrichment for HLA‐A*24:02‐restricted CD8(+) T cells in COVID‐19 patients and pre‐pandemic controls. The precursor frequencies for HLA‐A*24:02‐restricted epitopes were within the range previously observed for other SARS‐CoV‐2 epitopes for both COVID‐19 patients and pre‐pandemic individuals. Naïve A24/SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8(+) T cells increased ~7.5‐fold above the average precursor frequency during COVID‐19, gaining effector and memory phenotypes. Ex vivo single‐cell analyses of TCRαβ repertoires found that the A24/S(448) (+)CD8(+) T cell TCRαβ repertoire was driven by a common TCRβ chain motif, while the A24/S(1208) (+)CD8(+) TCRαβ repertoire was diverse across COVID‐19 patients. Our study provides an in depth characterisation and important insights into SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8(+) T cell responses associated with a prominent HLA‐A*24:02 allomorph.

Nasal mucosa was obtained surgically from the inferior turbinate. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) specific staining was observed in pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and was predominant in mucous cells of the seromucinous gland, while serous cells were almost devoid of stain. The pattern of staining of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 was similar to that of u-PA. In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) immunoreactive material was localized exclusively in serous cells of seromucinous glands. Positive staining for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was observed in endothelial cells and basal cells, which differentiate into either ciliated or goblet cells. Nasal secretions were partially fractionated by immunospecific antibody-immobilized Sepharose. Subsequent fibrin autography patterns indicated the presence of u-PA, PAI-1, and t-PA. After methacholine provocation, the level of t-PA increased transiently but decreased rapidly with subsequent challenges. These differential stainings of fibrinolytic components and the existence of PAs and PAI-1 in the nasal discharge suggest that the fibrinolytic system may play a role in the movement and fluidity of nasal secretion.","Yasuda, Toyotoshi; Sakata, Y.; Madoiwa, Seiji; Mimuro, Jun; Matsuda, Michio; Kitamura, Ken",Histochem Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9826124/,36
655844,Costs of providing COVID 19-protective measures during routine immunisation in lower-income countries?,2021-08-21,"The gold standard method in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal sample by RT-PCR. Recently, saliva samples has been suggested as an alternative due to being fast, reliable and non-invasive, rather than nasopharyngeal samples. We compared RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients. 98 of 200 patients were positive in RT-PCR analysis performed before the hospitalization. In day 0, at least one sample was positive in 67% of 98 patients. Positivity rate was 83% for both oro-nasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 63% for saliva samples (p<0.001). On day 5, RT-PCR was performed in 59 patients, 34% had at least one positive result. The positivity rate was 55% for saliva and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 60% for oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Our study shows that the sampling saliva does not increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests at early stages of infection. However, on 5th day, viral RNA detection rates in saliva were similar to nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. In conclusion, we suggest that, in patients receiving treatment, virus presence in saliva, in addition to the standard samples, is important to determine the isolation period and to control the transmission.","Akgun Dogan, O.; Kose, B.; Agaoglu, N.

They can be subdivided into those that aim to block specific pro-inflammatory and pro-neutrophilic cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL8 and IL-1β, and those that act on T2-mediated inflammation, respectively, by blocking IL-5 and/or its receptor, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, affecting IL-33 pathway and blocking TSLP. None of these approaches has proved to be effective, probably because in COPD there is no dominant cytokine or chemokine and, therefore, a single mAb cannot be effective on all pathways. With a more in-depth understanding of the numerous pheno/endotypic pathways that play a role in COPD, it may eventually be possible to identify those specific patients in whom some of these cytokines or chemokines might predominate. In this case, it will be possible to implement a personalized treatment, but the use of each mAb will only be reserved for a very limited number of subjects.","Cazzola, Mario; Ora, Josuel; Cavalli, Francesco; Rogliani, Paola; Matera, Maria Gabriella",Biologics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475751/; https://doi.org/10.2147/btt.s295409,36

The results however have remained heterogeneous. The present study was conducted to investigate the association between road traffic noise exposure and prevalence of coronary artery disease besides sub-group analysis was performed for identifying the most susceptible population. Traffic noise exposure was measured using the L(den) metric in both continuous and categorical forms. A cross-sectional study was performed and information about sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors was collected. Noise level < 60 dB(A) representing the quiet areas was used as the reference group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to estimate the odds for self-reported coronary artery disease concerning road traffic noise after adjusting for confounding variables. The residents living in noisy areas were found to have a 2.25 times higher risk per 5 dB(A) increment in the noise levels (95% CI = 1.38 to 3.67). Males were at a higher risk of CAD (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.84 to 3.72) as compared to females (OR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.37–3.13). The subgroup analysis revealed that being sensitive to noise, belonging to a higher age group, reporting higher stress levels, and poor sleep quality were associated with higher risk.

SDH patients had a mortality rate of 35.3% (n = 6), SAH had a mortality of 50% (n = 1), MCH patients had a mortality of 71.4% (n = 5), MFH patients had a mortality of 50% (n = 2), fICH patients had a mortality of 40% (n = 2). Patients with severe pulmonary COVID requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 10.24 [.43-243.12] p = 0.015), with INR > 1.2 on the day of the hemorrhagic event (OR 14.36 [1.69-122.14] p = 0.015], and patients presenting with spontaneous vs. traumatic hemorrhage (OR 6.11 [.31-118.89] p = 0.023) had significantly higher risk for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic presentations with COVID-19 are a rare but serious way in which the illness can manifest. It is important for neurosurgeons to realize that patients can present with these findings without primary pulmonary symptoms, and that severe pulmonary symptoms, elevated INR, and spontaneous hemorrhagic presentations is associated with increased risk for mortality.","Altschul, David J; Unda, Santiago R; Ramos, Rafael de La Garza; Zampolin, Richard; Benton, Joshua; Holland, Ryan; Fortunel, Adisson; Haranhalli, Neil",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846720304558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738585/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846720304558?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106112,36

In this systematic-review and meta-analysis, we explored the possible impact of health interventions delivered via mHealth tools on HRQoL of cancer patients. The systematic literature search was performed on July 20, 2019, to identify studies that evaluated the impact of mHealth intervention on HRQoL of cancer patients. We identified 25 studies (17 randomized controlled trials and 8 pre-post design studies; 957 patients) that evaluated mHealth interventions. The most commonly studied mHealth interventions included physical activity/ fitness interventions (9 studies), cognitive behavioral therapy (6 studies), mindfulness/ stress management (3 studies). In the majority of studies, mHealth interventions were associated with an improved HRQoL of cancer patients. The meta-analysis of the identified studies supported the positive effect of mHealth interventions for HRQoL of cancer patients. mHealth interventions are promising for improving HRQoL of cancer patients.","Buneviciene, Inesa; Mekary, Rania A.; Smith, Timothy R.; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka; Bunevicius, Adomas",Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842820302596?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103123; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1040842820302596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190065/,36
660725,Antimicrobial resistance: An unseen threat prowling behind the COVID-19 outbreak,2021-06-22,"Background: COVID-19 may differentially impact people with obesity. We aimed to describe and compare the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of obese patients with COVID-19 to those of non-obese patients with COVID-19, or obese patients with seasonal influenza. Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient/inpatient care, and claims data from January to June 2020 from the US, Spain, and the UK. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19. We created corresponding cohorts for patients with influenza in 2017-2018. We followed patients from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of socio-demographics, prior comorbidities, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. Findings: We included 627 044 COVID-19 (US: 502 650, Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336) and 4 549 568 influenza (US: 4 431 801, Spain: 115 224, UK: 2543) patients. The prevalence of obesity was higher among hospitalized COVID-19 (range: 38% to 54%) than diagnosed COVID-19 (30% to 47%), or diagnosed/hospitalized influenza (15% to 48%) patients. Obese hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more often female and younger than non-obese COVID-19 patients or obese influenza patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to have prior comorbidities, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, require intensive services, or die compared to non-obese COVID-19 patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were also more likely to require intensive services or die compared to obese influenza patients, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. Interpretation: We show that obesity is more common among COVID-19 than influenza patients, and that obese patients present with more severe forms of COVID-19 with higher hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality than non-obese patients.

This meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to study the efficacy in the reduction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (CO), and the risk of colchicine-related adverse events (CRAEs). Fourteen thousand and nine eighty three patients from 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, 9 in patients with coronary artery disease—CAD, 9 in patients with pericarditis, 4 in patients with atrial fibrillation—AF or heart failure. Colchicine was efficacious in the reduction of adverse CO across different settings: pericardial diseases (reduced risk of recurrent pericarditis, 17.6% vs. 35%, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41–0.61), CAD (reduced risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke,coronary revascularization or hospitalization, 6.1% vs. 8.5%, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64–0.83), AF (reduced risk of arrhythmia recurrence, 14.2% vs. 22.7%, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.88). Colchicine was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs (11.2% vs. 8.8%, RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.41–2.47) and drug discontinuation (5.4% vs. 3.7%, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.25–1.99). In both cases, the risk was proportional to the daily dose or duration of treatment, possibly due to early drug discontinuation or tolerance. Other CRAEs (muscle-related, liver,hematologic,cutaneous, infections) were not increased by colchicine, as long as all-cause death (2.2% vs. 1.9%, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79–1.54) or non-cardiovascular death (1.5% vs. 1%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.93–2.19). Colchicine is efficacious and safe for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs and drug discontinuation is not significant if colchicine is used at lower doses (0.5 mg daily) or for longer periods of time (> 6 months).

Data are from a cross-sectional study (N = 636) among Chinese and South Asian adults in Chicago collected between February and May 2020. One cohort of participants were surveyed from each ethnic group before the pandemic and a second cohort of participants were surveyed during the pandemic. Depression symptoms increased more than two-fold, from 9% pre-pandemic to 21% during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increase in depression symptoms during the pandemic for South Asians, men and adults older than 30 years.

By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed or coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, the interruption of contact tracing may be irreversible and, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the disease, may lead to outbreaks even in cases when the epidemic was initially under control.","Scarabel, F.; Pellis, L.; Ogden, N.

Tracheostomy is an essential procedure in critically ill COVID-19 patients; however, it is an aerosol-generating technique and thus carries the risk of infection transmission. We report our experience with percutaneous tracheostomy and its safety in a real medical setting. METHODS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 13 critically ill patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center between February 24 and April 30, 2020. Seven of these patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy using Ciaglia Blue Rhino. The medical environment, percutaneous tracheostomy method, and COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were retrospectively reviewed. After treatment, the COVID-19 infection status of healthcare personnel was investigated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The ICU contained negative pressure cohort areas and isolation rooms, and healthcare personnel wore a powered air-purifying respirator system. We performed seven cases of percutaneous tracheostomy in the same way as in patients without COVID-19. Five patients (71.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the time of tracheostomy. The median cycle threshold value for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was 30.60 (interquartile range [IQR], 25.50–36.56) in the upper respiratory tract and 35.04 (IQR, 28.40–36.74) in the lower respiratory tract. All healthcare personnel tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed with conventional methods in the negative pressure cohort area. It was safe to perform percutaneous tracheostomy in an environment of COVID-19 infection.","Kim, Eun Jin; Yoo, Eun-Hyung; Jung, Chi Young; Kim, Kyung Chan",Acute Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176402/; https://doi.org/10.4266/acc.2020.00444,36

We propose and apply a novel case‐leveling schema in a resource‐limited setting. Describing the surgical burden of otolaryngologic disease in this setting may critically inform resource planning to address global surgical disparities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of otolaryngology cases performed over a 28‐month period (1/2016‐4/2018) at a hospital in rural Cameroon. Case details were collated and categorized as a surrogate measure of otolaryngologic disease in resource‐limited settings. A case‐levelling schema based on temporal urgency and anticipated impact on health was proposed and applied. RESULTS: 1277 cases took place during the study. The largest proportion of cases were head and neck (517, 40%), followed by pediatrics (316, 25%). A four‐tiered leveling system was generated: level 1 cases were immediately life‐saving; level 2 cases were expected to result in a significant return to functions of daily living, or would prevent future death from cancer; level 3 cases aimed to significantly improve quality of life; level 4 cases were purely elective. Upon application of the schema, most cases were deemed to be level 2 (661, 52%). CONCLUSION: We use our experience in a resource‐limited setting to generate and apply a novel schema to be used for otolaryngology case triage in services facing unprecedented states of emergency such as the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.

In this paper, we review the literature about the common treatment of pemphigus with a focus on the lessons from similar epidemics to find a proper suggestion to manage pemphigus in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear.

As such, individuals of different beliefs and perspectives would respond differently to these mitigations. We examined the interaction between the Present-Hedonistic (PH) perspective and involuntary classroom transition on the belief in free will (N = 131). PH-oriented individuals exhibit a strong desire for choice while also welcome new opportunities and change. Importantly, the perceived freedom of choice and capacity for change also serve as foundational constructs to the belief in free will. Our results revealed that involuntary transition weakened the free will belief in those with lower PH but did not affect those of higher PH orientation. These findings suggest that the interplay between the perception of choice and capacity for change account for how individuals responded to the COVID-19 pandemic mitigation plans.","Isham, Eve A.; Lomayesva, Sara",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921007005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921007005,36

As part of broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourses, there is an emerging interest in data produced through mobile phone communications for enhancing the data environment in such circumstances. This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management. We show that mobile data holds great potential for improving the quality, quantity and timing of selected information required for disaster management, but that testing and evaluation of the benefits, constraints and limitations of mobile data use in a wider range of mobile-user and disaster contexts is needed to fully understand its utility, validity, and limitations.","Cinnamon, Jonathan; Jones, Sarah K.; Adger, W.

The loss of humoral immunity in ageing was attributed to the diminished numbers of B cells and the reduced ability to generate immunoglobulin. AIMS: To compare the intrinsic B‐cell capacity for differentiation into mature plasma cells (PCs), between young and old donors, using in vitro assays, providing either effective T‐cell help or activation via TLR engagement. METHODS: B cells were isolated from healthy individuals, in younger (30–38 years) and older (60–64 years) donors. An in vitro model system of B‐cell differentiation was used, analysing 5 differentiation markers by flow cytometry, under T‐dependent (TD: CD40/BCR stimulation) or T‐independent (TI: TLR7/BCR activation) conditions. Antibody secretion was measured by ELISA and gene expression using qPCR. RESULTS: TI and TD differentiation resulted in effective proliferation of B cells followed by their differentiation into PC. B‐cell‐executed TI differentiation was faster, all differentiation marker and genes being expressed earlier than under TD differentiation (day 6), although generating less viable cells and lower antibody levels (day 13). Age‐related differences in B‐cell capacity for differentiation were minimal in TD differentiation. In contrast, in TI differentiation age significantly affected proliferation, viability, differentiation, antibody secretion and gene expression, older donors being more efficient. CONCLUSION: Altogether, B‐cell differentiation into PC appeared similar between age groups when provided with T‐cell help, in contrast to TI differentiation, where multiple age‐related changes suggest better capacities in older donors. These new findings may help explain the emergence of autoantibodies in ageing.","Xie, Xuanxiao; Shrimpton, Jennifer; Doody, Gina M.; Conaghan, Philip G.; Ponchel, Frederique",Aging Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711204/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13341,36
667252,Demystifying BCG Vaccine and COVID-19 Relationship,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND Between 15% and 70% of adolescents report experiencing cybervictimization. Cybervictimization is associated with multiple negative consequences, including depressed mood. Few validated, easily disseminated interventions exist to prevent cybervictimization and its consequences. With over 97% of adolescents using social media (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat), recruiting and delivering a prevention intervention through social media and apps may improve accessibility of prevention tools for at-risk youth. OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of and obtain preliminary outcome data on IMPACT (Intervention Media to Prevent Adolescent Cyber-Conflict Through Technology), a brief, remote app-based intervention to prevent and reduce the effect of cyberbullying. METHODS From January 30, 2020, to May 3, 2020, a national sample of 80 adolescents with a history of past-year cybervictimization was recruited through Instagram for a randomized control trial of IMPACT, a brief, remote research assistant-led intervention and a fully automated app-based program, versus enhanced web-based resources (control). Feasibility and acceptability were measured by consent, daily use, and validated surveys. Although not powered for efficacy, outcomes (victimization, bystander self-efficacy, and well-being) were measured using validated measures at 8 and 16 weeks and evaluated using a series of longitudinal mixed models. RESULTS Regarding feasibility, 24.5% (121/494) of eligible participants provided contact information; of these, 69.4% (84/121) completed full enrollment procedures. Of the participants enrolled, 45% (36/80) were randomized into the IMPACT intervention and 55% (44/80) into the enhanced web-based resources groups. All participants randomized to the intervention condition completed the remote intervention session, and 89% (77/80) of the daily prompts were answered. The retention rate was 99% (79/80) at 8 weeks and 96% (77/80) at 16 weeks for all participants. Regarding acceptability, 100% (36/36) of the intervention participants were at least moderately satisfied with IMPACT overall, and 92% (33/36) of the participants were at least moderately satisfied with the app. At both 8 and 16 weeks, well-being was significantly higher (β=1.17, SE 0.87, P=.02 at 8 weeks and β=3.24, SE 0.95, P<.001 at 16 weeks) and psychological stress was lower (β=-.66, SE 0.08, P=.04 at 8 weeks and β=-.89, SE 0.09, P<.001 at 16 weeks) among IMPACT users than among control group users. Participants in the intervention group attempted significantly more bystander interventions than those in the control group at 8 weeks (β=.82, SE 0.42; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS This remote app-based intervention for victims of cyberbullying was feasible and acceptable, increased overall well-being and bystander interventions, and decreased psychological stress. Our findings are especially noteworthy given that the trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of Instagram to recruit adolescents can be a successful strategy for identifying and intervening with those at the highest risk of cybervictimization.

668212,The PACTS principles for patient involvement in health economics research,2020-10-31,"During the past two decades there has been a major shift in the choice of agents to treat multiple myeloma, whether newly diagnosed or in the relapsed/refractory stage. The introduction of new drug classes, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and anti-CD38 and anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibodies, coupled with autologous stem cell transplantation, has approximately doubled the disease’s five-year survival rate. However, this positive news is tempered by the realization that these measures are not curative and patients eventually relapse and/or become resistant to the drug’s effects. Thus, there is a need to discover newer myeloma-driving molecular markers and develop innovative drugs designed to precisely regulate the actions of such putative targets. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is found almost exclusively on the surfaces of malignant plasma cells to the exclusion of other cell types, including their normal counterparts, has emerged as a specific target of interest in this regard. Immunotherapeutic agents have been at the forefront of research designed to block BCMA activity. These agents encompass monoclonal antibodies, such as the drug conjugate belantamab mafodotin; bispecific T-cell engager strategies exemplified by AMG 420; and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapeutics that include idecabtagene vicleucel (bb2121) and JNJ-68284528.","Abramson, Hanley N.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21155192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32707894/,36
668461,Paediatric post-COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome mimicking appendicitis: a case series.,2021-09-01,"The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to urgent needs for reliable diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current guideline is using RT-PCR for testing. As a complimentary tool with diagnostic imaging, chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been shown to be able to reveal visual patterns characteristic for COVID-19, which has definite value at several stages during the disease course. To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided characterization and diagnosis with chest CT scan, which has shown promising results. However, domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge when deploying learning-based models. A common way to alleviate this issue is to fine-tune the model locally with the target domains local data and annotations. Unfortunately, the availability and quality of local annotations usually varies due to heterogeneity in equipment and distribution of medical resources across the globe. This impact may be pronounced in the detection of COVID-19, since the relevant patterns vary in size, shape, and texture. In this work, we attempt to find a solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy. Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a distributed setting.

668645,A 5-min RNA preparation method for COVID-19 detection with RT-qPCR,2020-05-08,"Limitations of monolayer culture conditions have motivated scientists to explore new models that can recapitulate the architecture and function of human organs more accurately. Recent advances in the improvement of protocols have resulted in establishing three-dimensional (3D) organ-like architectures called ‘organoids’ that can display the characteristics of their corresponding real organs, including morphological features, functional activities, and personalized responses to specific pathogens. We discuss different organoid-based 3D models herein, which are classified based on their original germinal layer. Studies of organoids simulating the complexity of real tissues could provide novel platforms and opportunities for generating practical knowledge along with preclinical studies, including drug screening, toxicology, and molecular pathophysiology of diseases. This paper also outlines the key challenges, advantages, and prospects of current organoid systems.

668923,How COVID-19 is Helping Us Learn More about Diabetes Pathogenesis,2021-09-10,"With increasing frequency, humans are facing outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In the most extreme instances, such outbreaks can become pandemics, as we are now witnessing with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, this new disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has already infected more than 10 million people worldwide and led to 499,913 deaths as of 29 June, 2020. How high these numbers will eventually go depends on many factors, including policies on travel and movement, availability of medical support, and, because there is no vaccine or highly effective treatment, the pace of biomedical research. Other than an approved antiviral drug that can be repurposed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold the most promise for providing a stopgap measure to lessen the impact of an outbreak while vaccines are in development. Technical advances in mAb identification, combined with the flexibility and clinical experience of mAbs in general, make them ideal candidates for rapid deployment. Furthermore, the development of mAb cocktails can provide a faster route to developing a robust medical intervention than searching for a single, outstanding mAb. In addition, mAbs are well-suited for integration into platform technologies for delivery, in which minimal components need to be changed in order to be redirected against a novel pathogen. In particular, utilizing the manufacturing and logistical benefits of DNA-based platform technologies in order to deliver one or more antiviral mAbs has the potential to revolutionize EID responses.","Andrews, Chasity D.; Huang, Yaoxing; Ho, David D.; Liberatore, Rachel A.",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1787108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579067/,36
669055,The Unique Impact of COVID-19 on Human Gut Microbiome Research,2021-03-16,"We aim to establish a comprehensive COVID-19 autoantigen atlas in order to understand autoimmune diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.","Wang, Julia Y.; Zhang, Wei; Roehrl, Michael W.; Roehrl, Victor B.; Roehrl, Michael H.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655248/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.21.432171,36

However, the broad restrictive measures typically associated with lockdowns, though effective, also comes at a cost – imposing significant social and economic burdens on individuals and societies, especially for those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Like most high-income countries (HICs), many LMICs initially adopted broad lockdown strategies for COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic. While many HICs experiencing subsequent waves have returned to employing lockdown strategies until they can receive the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine, many LMICs will likely have to wait much longer to get comparable access for their own citizens. In leaving LMICs vulnerable to subsequent waves for a longer period of time without vaccines, there is a risk LMICs will be tempted to re-impose lockdown measures in the meantime. In response to the urgent need for more policy development around the contextual challenges involved in employing such measures, we propose some strategies LMICs could adopt for safe and responsible lockdown entrance/exit or to avoid re-imposing coercive restrictive lockdown measures altogether.","Eyawo, Oghenowede; Viens, A.

Emerging evidence supports that energy metabolism is affected in ME/CFS, but a unifying metabolic phenotype has not been firmly established. We performed global metabolomics, lipidomics, and hormone measurements, and we used exploratory data analyses to compare serum from 83 patients with ME/CFS and 35 healthy controls. Some changes were common in the patient group, and these were compatible with effects of elevated energy strain and altered utilization of fatty acids and amino acids as catabolic fuels. In addition, a set of heterogeneous effects reflected specific changes in 3 subsets of patients, and 2 of these expressed characteristic contexts of deregulated energy metabolism. The biological relevance of these metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) was supported by clinical data and independent blood analyses. In summary, we report a map of common and context-dependent metabolic changes in ME/CFS, and some of them presented possible associations with clinical patient profiles. We suggest that elevated energy strain may result from exertion-triggered tissue hypoxia and lead to systemic metabolic adaptation and compensation. Through various mechanisms, such metabolic dysfunction represents a likely mediator of key symptoms in ME/CFS and possibly a target for supportive intervention.","Hoel, Fredrik; Hoel, August; Pettersen, Ina K.N.; Rekeland, Ingrid G.; Risa, Kristin; Alme, Kine; Sørland, Kari; Fosså, Alexander; Lien, Katarina; Herder, Ingrid; Thürmer, Hanne L.; Gotaas, Merete E.; Schäfer, Christoph; Berge, Rolf K.; Sommerfelt, Kristian; Marti, Hans-Peter; Dahl, Olav; Mella, Olav; Fluge, Øystein; Tronstad, Karl J.",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.149217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423789/,36

Currently, the World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 (more commonly known as COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. It is projected that the path of COVID-19 could kill 50–80 million people and impacts the world’s economy in its devastating global sweep. The surge is increasing on global and national levels, causing rapid loss of life, joblessness, deterioration of the healthcare systems, and both national and global economies. In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March. Since then, the government has been taking different measures to prevent its spread. Locking down all schools, declared social distancing and hand hygiene, and restricting large gatherings were some of the Ethiopian government’s actions. OBJECTIVE: To determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 331 participants selected using a systematic random sampling method were included in the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After describing the variables using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with knowledge and chi-squared tests for attitudes and practices towards COVID-19. RESULTS: The study participants were primarily males (70%) and mean age 30.5 (SD=11) years. The mean knowledge score was 8.73 (SD=2.64), with less than half 42.9% (95% CI: 37.5–48%) of the study participants were knowledgeable. Regarding the attitude questions, three-fourths of the participants believed that Ethiopia will control and win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of the participants replied that the Ethiopian government is handling this pandemic health crisis well. About half of the study participants reported that they had gone to crowded places in recent days, did not wear face mask when leaving home, and practiced preventive measures given by local health authorities. Knowledge score was statistically significantly associated with gender, age, and educational status of the study participants, whereas attitude and practices were significantly associated with educational status and knowledge of participants.","Haftom, Mekonnen; Petrucka, Pammla; Gemechu, Kbrom; Mamo, Haftamu; Tsegay, Tesfay; Amare, Embay; Kahsay, Hayelom; Gebremariam, Alem",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s275744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116693/,36

The decline in sales provokes intra-organizational and inter-organizational tension, requiring a new approach for managing firms' business operations. Particularly, the direct threat to human beings places the attention of managers on the individual. This study investigates the main differences between prior “traditional” financial-based crises and the practices that managers can adopt to navigate and survive the Coronavirus crisis from a social exchange theory (SET) view. The authors identify eight crisis-comparative dimensions to consider to successfully prevail: (1) formation, (2) focus, (3) temporality, (4) government jurisdiction, (5) preparedness, (6) normality, (7) business, and (8) operational deployment. In addition, the study results propose four intertwined areas to classify the managerial practices: (1) digital transformation, (2) decision-making processes, (3) leadership, and (4) emotions and stress.","Cortez, Roberto Mora; Johnston, Wesley J.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850120303394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850120303394?v=s5,36
670333,Foreword to the JCTS COVID-19 special issue,2021-06-03,"Over the years, health sciences librarians have been change agents, leading the charge on issues of importance to the profession and the communities we serve. From its founding in 1898 with the Exchange, the Medical Library Association (MLA) has been dedicated to improving access to health information. In 2003, the Board of Directors published a statement supporting open access to information generated from federally funded scientific and medical research and maintained that having access to timely, relevant, and accurate information is vital to the health of the nation and its education and research programs. At some financial risk, the association made the Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) open access and published the entire archive of JMLA and its predecessor, the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, in PubMed Central. Nearly two decades later, the promise of open access and open science finally seems to be coming to fruition. In the 2020 Janet Doe Lecture, Chris Shaffer, AHIP, described the ways that MLA has led the profession, standing behind a shared vision and “walking the walk.” In challenging listeners to embrace open science, he affirmed that, as leaders in improving access to health sciences information since 1898, medical librarians must work in the open science arena to realize our vision “that quality information is essential for improved health.”","Shaffer, Chris",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424459/; https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2021.1127,36

Some validation studies have used frozen aliquots mainly from adults. The aim of this real-life study was to test the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (SC2-RAT) in children. Symptomatic patients aged 0 to 17 years were recruited in the emergency department of the University Hospital of Creteil and in primary care pediatric practices from October 10, 2020 for 7 weeks. Each enrolled child had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and a SC2-RAT from two distinct nasopharyngeal swabs. Among the 308 patients (mean [SD] age 4.9 [5.3] years), fever was the main symptom (73.4%), with no difference between COVID-19–negative and –positive groups. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 10.7% (95% CI 7.5–14.7). On the whole cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of the SC2-RAT compared to RT-PCR was 87.9% (95% CI 71.8–96.6) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.3–99.6). Considering samples with cycle threshold >25, the sensibility was lower: 63.6% (95% CI 30.8–89.1) and the specificity 99.6% (95% CI 98.0–100.0). The mean delay to obtain an SC2-RAT result was <15 min but was 3.2 h (SD 5.5) for an RT-PCR result. Contact with a COVID-19–positive person was more frequent for COVID-19–positive than –negative patients (n = 21, 61.6%, vs. n = 64, 24.6%; p < 0.01). In real life, SC2-RAT seems reliable for symptomatic children, allowing to detect contagious children.","Jung, Camille; Levy, Corinne; Varon, Emmanuelle; Biscardi, Sandra; Batard, Christophe; Wollner, Alain; Deberdt, Patrice; Sellam, Aurélie; Hau, Isabelle; Cohen, Robert",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336732/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.647274,36

ICI-induced pneumonitis is a serious complication seen with treatment with these agents. Cancer has been reported to be one of the risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that has engulfed the world in the last couple of months. In patients with cancer treated with ICI who present at the emergency department with respiratory symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, correct diagnosis can be challenging. Symptoms and radiological features of ICI pneumonitis can be overlapping with those of COVID-19 related pneumonia. For the latter, dexamethasone and remdesivir have shown encouraging results, while vaccines are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. The mainstay of treatment in ICI pneumonitis is immunosuppressive therapy, as this is a potentially fatal adverse event. It has been speculated that immunosuppression may be associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19, especially during the early stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, distinction between these two entities is warranted. We summarize the clinical, radiological features as well as additional investigations of both entities, and suggest a diagnostic algorithm for distinction between the two. This algorithm may be a supportive tool for clinicians to diagnose the underlying cause of the pneumonitis in patients treated with ICI during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Dumoulin, Daphne W.; Gietema, Hester A.; Paats, Marthe S.; Hendriks, Lizza E.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and uptake of a vaccine, it is important that the search for treatments continue. An exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation. Observational data from patients already on anti-TNF therapy show a reduced rate of COVID-19 poor outcomes and death compared with other immune-suppressing therapies. Anti-TNF has a long history of safe use, including in special at-risk populations, and is widely available. The case to adequately assess anti-TNF as a treatment for COVID-19 is compelling.","Robinson, Philip C.; Liew, David F.L.; Liew, Jean W.; Monaco, Claudia; Richards, Duncan; Shivakumar, Senthuran; Tanner, Helen L.; Feldmann, Marc",Med (N Y),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666634020300283; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294881/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634020300283?v=s5,36

The global response throughout the world has been primarily the implementation of lockdown measures, testing and contact tracing to minimise the spread of the disease. The aim of the present study was to predict the COVID-19 prevalence and disease progression rate in Indian scenario in order to provide an analysis that can shed light on comprehending the trends of the outbreak and outline an impression of the epidemiological stage for each state of a diverse country like India. In addition, the forecast of COVID-19 incidence trends of these states can help take safety measures and policy design for this epidemic in the days to come. In order to achieve the same, we have utilized an approach where we test modelling choices of the spatially unambiguous kind, proposed by the wave of infections spreading from the initial slow progression to a higher curve. We have estimated the parameters of an individual state using factors like population density and mobility. The findings can also be used to strategize the testing and quarantine processes to manipulate the spread of the disease in the future. This is especially important for a country like India that has several limitations about healthcare infrastructure, diversity in socioeconomic status, high population density, housing conditions, health care coverage that can be important determinants for the overall impact of the pandemic.

METHODS: This was a single-center health service evaluation. We began testing for COVID-19 on 3 March and introduced a modified “COVID Stroke Thrombectomy Pathway” on 18 March. We analyzed the clinical, procedural and outcome data for 61 consecutive stroke thrombectomy patients between 1 January and 30 April. We compared the data for January and February (“pre-COVID,” n = 33) versus March and April (“during COVID,” n = 28). RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar between the 2 groups (mean age 71 ± 12.8 years, 39% female). During the COVID-19 pandemic, (a) total stroke admissions fell by 17% but the thrombectomy rate was maintained at 20% of ischemic strokes; (b) successful recanalization rate was maintained at 81% (c) early neurological outcomes (neurological improvement following thrombectomy and inpatient mortality) were not significantly different; (d) use of general anesthesia fell significantly from 85 to 32% as intended; and (e) time intervals from onset to arrival, groin puncture, and recanalization were not significantly different, whereas internal delays for external referrals significantly improved for door-to-groin puncture (48 [interquartile range (IQR) 39–57] vs. 33 [IQR 27–44] minutes, p = 0.013) and door-to-recanalization (82.5 [IQR 61–110] vs. 60 [IQR 55–70] minutes, p = 0.018).

Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. METHODS: A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. RESULTS: The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/ml and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100% and 99.2% respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3%. CONCLUSION: The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay. Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 minutes, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.","Nörz, Dominik; Fischer, Nicole; Schultze, Alexander; Kluge, Stefan; Mayer-Runge, Ulrich; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388471/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301323?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104390,36
674951,Is precision medicine relevant in the age of COVID-19?,2021-01-13,"This work compares deaths for confirmed COVID-19 cases in China to eight other countries, Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands and South Korea. After implementing varying intensities and timing of social distancing measures, several appear to be converging onto the decline in the daily growth rate of deaths, or relative second derivative of total deaths, seen in China after the implementation an aggressive social distancing policy. By calculating future trajectories in these countries based on the observed Chinese fatality statistics, an estimate of the total deaths and maximum daily death rates over a defined period of time is made. Our lower bound estimate for the United Kingdom based on the real data approximates the lower bound estimate of the recent modelling study of Ferguson et al. [1]. These results suggest there may be a threshold of effective public health intervention. Our method of viewing the data may be helpful in monitoring the course of the epidemic, judging the effectiveness of implementation, and monitoring the relaxation of social distancing.","Pike, William Thomas; Saini, Vikas",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20041475,36
675015,COVID‐19 Pandemic: Considerations for resuming normalcy in colorectal service,2020-08-13,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of >600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.","Xiao, Xia; Wang, Conghui; Chang, De; Wang, Ying; Dong, Xiaojing; Jiao, Tao; Zhao, Zhendong; Ren, Lili; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Sharma, Lokesh; Lei, Xiaobo; Wang, Jianwei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.188953,36

Therefore, therapeutically addressing degenerative aging processes as the main risk factors appears promising for tackling the present crisis and is expected to be relevant when tackling future infections, epidemics and pandemics. Therefore, utilizing a geroscience approach, targeting aging processes to prevent multimorbidity, via initiating broad clinical trials of potential geroprotective therapies, is recommended.","Barzilai, Nir; Appleby, James C; Austad, Steven N; Cuervo, Ana Maria; Kaeberlein, Matt; Gonzalez-Billault, Christian; Lederman, Stephanie; Stambler, Ilia; Sierra, Felipe",Aging Dis,https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765937/,36
675611,Survey of air exchange rates and evaluation of airborne infection risk of COVID-19 on commuter trains,2021-07-23,"Half the world's population is already under lock-down and the remainder will have to follow if the ongoing novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) virus pandemic is to be contained. Faced with such brutally difficult decisions, it is essential that as many people as possible understand (1) why lock-down interventions represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into public health catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so aggressively and for such extended periods, and (3) why international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries that have successfully eliminated local transmission represents the only way to contain the pandemic at global level. Here we present simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe, national containment and elimination with less than 10 deaths is predicted for highly rigorous lock down within 5 weeks of the first confirmed cases and maintained for 15 weeks. However, elimination may only be sustained if case importation from outside the country is comprehensively contained by isolating for three weeks all incoming travellers, except those from countries certified as COVID-free in the future. Any substantive relaxation of these assumptions, specifically shortening the lock-down period, less rigorous lock-down or imperfect importation containment, may facilitate epidemic re-initiation, resulting in over half a million deaths unless rigorously contained a second time. Removing contact tracing and isolation has minimal impact on successful containment trajectories because high incidence of similar mild symptoms caused by other common pathogens attenuates detection success of COVID-19 testing. Nevertheless, contact tracing is recommended as an invaluable epidemiological surveillance platform for monitoring and characterizing the epidemic, and for understanding the influence of interventions on transmission dynamics.","Killeen, G.; Kiware, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.15.20066845v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066845,36

Environmental Health, whose role in the One Health concept is well established, has been associated with COVID-19 pandemic via various direct and indirect pathways. Modern lifestyle, climate change, environmental degradation, exposure to chemicals such as endocrine disruptors, and exposure to psychological stress factors impact human health negatively. As a result, many people are in the disadvantageous position to face the pandemic with an already impaired immune system due to their exposure to environmental health hazards. Moreover, the ongoing pandemic has been associated with outdoor and indoor air pollution, water and noise pollution, food security, and plastic pollution issues. Also, the inadequate infrastructure, the lack of proper waste and wastewater management, and the unequal social vulnerability reveal more linkages between Environmental Health and COVID-19 pandemic.

678241,Vitamin D Levels and COVID-19 Susceptibility: Is there any Correlation?,2020-06-02,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally, and the government of each affected country is publishing the number of deaths every day. This official figure is an underestimate as it excludes anybody who did not die in a hospital, who did not test positive, who had a false result, or those who recovered on their own without a test. Objective: This study aimed to measure the community level excess mortality using health and demographic surveillance in a rural area of Bangladesh. Method: The study was conducted in Matlab, in a rural area of Bangladesh, with a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) covering a population of 239,030 individuals living in 54,823 households in 142 villages. We examined the mortality in January-April from 2015 to 2020 and compared the mortality in 2020 with the historical trend of 2015–2019. Between 2015 and 2020, we followed 276,868 people until migration or death, whichever occurred first. We analyzed mortality using crude mortality rate ratio (MRR) and adjusted MRR (aMRR) from a Cox proportional hazard model. Mortality was analyzed according to age, sex, and period. Results: During follow-up, 3,197 people died. The mortality rate per 1,000 person-years increased from 10 in 2019 to 12 in 2020. Excess mortality was observed among the elderly population (aged 65 years and above). The elderly mortality rate per 1,000 person-years increased from 80 in 2019 to 110 in 2020, and the aMRR was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.19–1.64). Although an increasing tendency in mortality was observed between 2015 and 2019, it was statistically insignificant. Conclusions: The study reported a 28% increase in excess deaths among the elderly population during the first months of the pandemic. This all-cause mortality estimation at the community level will urge policymakers, public health professionals, and researchers to further investigate the causes of death and the underlying reasons for excess deaths in the older age-group.","Hanifi, Syed Manzoor Ahmed; Alam, Sayed Saidul; Shuma, Sanjida Siddiqua; Reidpath, Daniel D.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.622379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395351/,36

Especially in the area of knowledge work, mobile and distributed work provides advantages over presence time at companies: It offers more freedom and flexibility to the employees, reduces travel time, and counteracts a major trend: the exodus from rural areas. However, to provide an optimized digital work environment for distributed teams of knowledge workers, many different aspects must be considered, including social, physical, legal, and technological aspects. In this article, we focus on the technological aspects. Nowadays, a multitude of tools and technologies exist to support the communication of distributed teams, to allow working concurrently on documents, or to support data and document exchange. However, many existing solutions only provide solutions for a specific purpose rather than a sophisticated platform that offers all of these services in an integrated manner and additionally takes care of delivering intelligent and data-driven services in a trustful and ethical way. In the research project “Digital Teams”, we aim at developing such a platform as open source. In this article, we provide the basic architecture of our platform and share the main concepts and solutions we are currently implementing, such as our dashboard, data exchange concepts, or authentication and authorization mechanisms.","Schweitzer, Stefan; Gerbershagen, Matthias; Elberzhager, Frank; Braun, Susanne",Procedia Computer Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920316902; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.07.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834877/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877050920316902,36

Therefore, “lockdown” was issued in affected countries to control the spread of the virus. To assess air pollution during and after lockdowns, this study selected pandemic hotspots in China (Wuhan), Japan (Tokyo), the Republic of Korea (Daegu), and India (Mumbai) and compared the Air Quality Index (AQI) in these areas for the past three years. The results indicated that air pollution levels were positively correlated with a reduction in pollutant levels during and after lockdowns in these cities. In Tokyo, low levels of air pollution, no significant change in the distribution of “good” and “moderate” days was observed during lockdown. In Daegu, mid-level air pollution, the percentage of “unhealthy” days (AQI>100) markedly reduced during lockdown; however, this reverted after lockdown was lifted. In Wuhan and Mumbai, high air pollution levels, the percentage of unhealthy days remarkably decreased during lockdown and continued to reduce after lockdown. It was found that PM(2.5) was the critical pollutant for all cities because its sub-AQI was the largest of the six pollutant species for the majority of days. In addition, PM(10) dominated the overall AQI for 2.2–9.6% of the period in Wuhan and Mumbai, and its sub-AQI reduced during lockdown. The mean sub-AQI for NO(2), SO(2), CO, and O(3) was within the “good” category for all cities. In conclusion, the lockdown policy reduced air pollution in general and this reduction was more significant for regions with high air pollution levels.","Hu, Meng; Chen, Zhongbing; Cui, Haiyan; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Chao; Yun, Keming",Atmos Pollut Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1309104220303366; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.11.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104220303366?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281465/,36

The circulating pattern and genetic characteristics in the HRSV attachment glycoprotein gene were investigated in Turkey during six consecutive seasons from 2009 to 2015. HRSVA was dominant in the all epidemic seasons except 2011‐2012 season. Partial sequences of the HVR2 region of the G gene of 479 HRSVA and 135 HRSVB were obtained. Most Turkish strains belonged to NA1, ON1, and BA9, which were the predominant genotypes circulating worldwide. Although three novel genotypes, TR‐A, TR‐BA1, and TR‐BA2, were identified, they were not predominant. Clinical data were available for 69 HRSV‐positive patients who were monitored due to acute lower respiratory tract illness. There were no significant differences in the clinical diagnosis, hospitalization rates, laboratory findings and treatment observed between the HRSVA and HRSVB groups, and co‐infections in this study. The major population afflicted by HRSV infections included infants and children between 13 and 24 months of age. We detected that the CB1, GB5, and THB strains clustered in the same branch with a bootstrap value of 100%. CB‐B and BA12 strains clustered in the same branch with a bootstrap value of 65%.

We aimed to investigate susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We did a multicentre retrospective study of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patients with rheumatic diseases were contacted through an automated telephone-based survey to investigate their susceptibility to COVID-19. Data about COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis were collected. Families with a documented history of COVID-19 exposure, as defined by having at least one family member diagnosed with COVID-19, were followed up by medical professionals to obtain detailed information, including sex, age, smoking history, past medical history, use of medications, and information related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and March 30, 2020, 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included in the study. The overall rate of COVID-19 in patients with an autoimmune rheumatic disease in our study population was 0·43% (27 of 6228 patients). We identified 42 families in which COVID-19 was diagnosed between Dec 20, 2019, and March 20, 2020, in either patients with a rheumatic disease or in a family member residing at the same physical address during the outbreak. Within these 42 families, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 27 (63%) of 43 patients with a rheumatic disease and in 28 (34%) of 83 of their family members with no rheumatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·68 [95% CI 1·14–6·27]; p=0·023). Patients with rheumatic disease who were taking hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of COVID-19 infection than patients taking other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (OR 0·09 [95% CI 0·01–0·94]; p=0·044). Additionally, the risk of COVID-19 was increased with age (adjusted OR 1·04 [95%CI 1·01–1·06]; p=0·0081).

An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman’s rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspots and cluster/outlier areas were observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (p < 0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemics at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020.

681507,A survey of the health and safety conditions of apartment buildings in Hong Kong,2007-03-19,"The term ‘Greater China’ is defined in this chapter as one which includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

The primary structure of EDA-2 is highly similar to those of the high-mannose N-glycan specific lectins including Oscillatoria agardhii (OAA) and Burkholderia oklahomensis EO147 (BOA) from cyanobacteria, Myxococcus xanthus (MBHA) and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (PFL) from bacteria, and ESA-2 from a macro red alga. The hemagglutination activities were commonly inhibited by the glycoproteins bearing high-mannose N-glycans, but not by monosaccharides examined, including mannose. In a direct binding experiment with pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, an isolectin EDA-2 exclusively bound to high-mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans that include complex types and a core pentasaccharide of N-glycans, indicating that it recognized the branched oligomannoside moiety. Its binding activity was subtly different among the oligomannoside structures examined, showing that the lectin has preference affinity for high-mannose type N-glycans with an exposed (α1-3) mannose residue in the D2 arm. Interestingly, EDAs, the mixture of three isolectins inhibited the growth of shrimp pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi. Growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus with EDAs was not observed in the presence of yeast mannan bearing high-mannose N-glycans, suggesting that EDAs caused the activity through binding to the target receptor(s) on the surface of V. alginolyticus. These results indicate that cultivated carrageenophyte E. denticulatum is a good source of a lectin(s) that may be useful as a carbohydrate probe and an antibacterial reagent.","Hung, Le Dinh; Hirayama, Makoto; Ly, Bui Minh; Hori, Kanji",J Appl Phycol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214663/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10811-014-0441-0,36

There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread. This review aimed to summarise the evidence around viral shedding vs infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.","Widders, Arabella; Broom, Alex; Broom, Jennifer",Infect Dis Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045120300286; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045120300286?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473952/,36

The introduction of mRNA COVID vaccines and the significant reactogenicity seen with vaccination has caused an unanticipated impact on the operating room workforce via unanticipated paid time off after employee vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional survey was made available to approximately 33,000 front-line healthcare workers, students and volunteers who were offered voluntary vaccination in a state-wide healthcare system during phase one of the state's vaccine roll-out. The primary study aim was to determine the frequency of unanticipated paid time off, and the secondary study aim was to identify any demographic determinants influencing the need for unanticipated time off work secondary to adverse effects. RESULTS: 4009 responses were received, a 12.15% response rate. When looking specifically at individuals who did not proactively schedule themselves for time off after vaccination, we determined that unanticipated paid administrative leave was required for 4.9% and 19.79% of individuals after the first and second doses of vaccine, respectively. The average lengths of absence were 1.66 days and 1.39 days for the first and second doses, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences found in the need for unanticipated leave when compared by vaccine manufacturer, gender, age, ethnicity, or job description. However, individuals with a bachelor's degree demonstrated a significantly higher unanticipated leave requirement than respondents who reported other educational backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to staff operating rooms and other critical healthcare services may be negatively affected as a result of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination reactogenicity and subsequent unanticipated paid administrative leave. For future COVID-19 boosters or during other pandemics in which mRNA vaccination is recommended, employees should proactively schedule their vaccination(s) in conjunction with their work schedules to minimize the impact of reactogenicity and unanticipated time off on the operating room schedule and patient care.","Levi, Marc L.; McMillan, Daniel; Dhandha, Vishal; Allan, Jennifer; D'ercole, Fran",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405603021000662; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcorm.2021.100220; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405603021000662?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604550/,36

Non-government organisations provide many essential services across the world, especially in the developing world, where they supplement or in some instances extend the government services. With services from health to gender issues to humanitarian support, non-government organisations continue to grapple with insufficiency of core and programming funding and unstable staffing. In Samoa, technical assistance through government volunteers supplemented the need for expert human resource and enabled the ability to apply for funding. With the mass repatriation of government volunteers such as Australian Volunteers, American Peace Corps and Japanese International Cooperation Agency, it resulted in a sudden and massive gap in technical human resource, equipped to apply for the rapidly expanding number of funding options. Through the experiences of a non-government organisation worker and an academic researcher based in Samoa, this piece shares the current experiences and potential repercussions of this sudden change in the non-government sector and suggestions moving forward to utilize the existing expertise in country in the academic sector to support non-government organizations to access funding.","Tierney, Annika; Boodoosingh, Ramona",World Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20302400; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20302400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834391/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105113,36

Urbanization carries potential health benefits due to improved access to an increased variety of food imports, although for the growing number of urban poor, this has often meant increased reliance on cheap, highly processed food commodities. Reduced barriers to trade have eased the importation of such commodities, while investment liberalization has increased corporate consolidation over global and domestic food chains. Higher profit margins on processed foods have promoted the creation of ‘obesogenic’ environments, which through progressively integrated global food systems have been increasingly ‘exported’ to developing nations. This article explores globalization processes, the food environment, and dietary health outcomes in SSA through the use of trend analyses and structural equation modelling.

Determination of cause of death helps in understanding why and how it occurs, and it is an indispensable aid to parents wanting to understand why their baby died and to determine the recurrence risk and management in subsequent pregnancy. Consequently, a perinatal death requires adequate diagnostic investigation. An important first step in the analysis of PD is to identify the case circumstances, including relevant details regarding maternal history, obstetric history and current pregnancy (complications are evaluated and recorded). In the next step, placental examination is suggested in all cases, together with molecular cytogenetic evaluation and fetal autopsy. Investigation for fetal–maternal hemorrhage by Kleihauer is also recommended as standard. In cases where parents do not consent to autopsy, alternative approaches such as minimally invasive postmortem examination, postmortem magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal photographs are good alternatives. After all investigations have been performed it is important to combine findings from the clinical review and investigations together, to identify the most probable cause of death and counsel the parents regarding their loss.","Nijkamp, J.W.; Sebire, N.J.; Bouman, K.; Korteweg, F.J.; Erwich, J.J.H.M.; Gordijn, S.J.",Semin Fetal Neonatal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325580/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2017.02.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744165X17300203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1744165X17300203,36

In spite of governments implementing various strategies across the globe, the pandemic is still expanding with increasing numbers of positive cases. In addition, countries are reopening and easing lockdown restrictions in order to get their economies back on track, and this has led to an increase in the transmission of novel coronavirus. Therefore, it is essential to regularly review the containment strategies employed in different regions in order to understand the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and to formulate a future course of actions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to review the COVID-19 transmission statistics in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and European Union (EU) countries, and to compare these data with the various containment strategies implemented for containing the spread of the virus. METHODS: A review method was adopted along with different statistical methods for comparing and analyzing COVID-19 data and containment strategies. Transmission types and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the countries in both regions are used to present the current state of the pandemic. In addition, changes in the number of COVID-19 cases are compared with the mitigation and suppression strategies implemented in both regions and their impact is analyzed. RESULTS: Countries in the EU were slow in reacting to the pandemic, as delays are observed in the implementation of mitigation strategies. However, suppression strategies were implemented soon after mitigation strategies. GCC countries, on the other hand, were quick to react, and they implemented both mitigation and suppression strategies simultaneously, as soon as the pandemic emerged. The CFR was found to be low among GCC countries compared to EU countries. In addition, a second wave of transmission was observed in the EU, whereas in GCC countries there has been no second wave, although a gradual increase in the number of cases is observed. Community transmission was observed among the majority of countries in both GCC and EU countries.

Psychological Experiences of People was generated prominently with sub-themes indicating the perceived experiences like fear of spreading diseases to others, and the need for psychological counseling. Attitude of others toward patients and caregivers revealed that family members and relatives played a major positive role on the patient's mental health, however, the neighbor's stigmatized attitude led to several undesired behaviors. Social Connectedness was another major theme derived from the study.

So far, few effective drugs have emerged to assist in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, though some herbal medicine candidates may assist in the fight against COVID-19 deaths. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main active ingredient of black seed oil, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anticoagulant activities. TQ also increases the activity and number of cytokine suppressors, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages, and it has demonstrated antiviral potential against a number of viruses, including murine cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and other coronaviruses. Recently, TQ has demonstrated notable antiviral activity against a SARSCoV-2 strain isolated from Egyptian patients and, interestingly, molecular docking studies have also shown that TQ could potentially inhibit COVID-19 development through binding to the receptor-binding domain on the spike and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which may hinder virus entry into the host cell and inhibit its ion channel and pore forming activity. Other studies have shown that TQ may have an inhibitory effect on SARS CoV2 proteases, which could diminish viral replication, and it has also demonstrated good antagonism to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, allowing it to interfere with virus uptake into the host cell. Several studies have also noted its potential protective capability against numerous chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, renal dysfunction and malignancy. TQ has recently been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of several different diseases, and this review thus aims to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of TQ in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Badary, Osama A; Hamza, Marwa S; Tikamdas, Rajiv",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s308863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976534/,36

NF-κB activation needs the activation of NF-κB upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, NF-κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs), IκBα, and NF-κB dimer p50/p65. To survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit NF-κB activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IκBα, and p50/p65. To inhibit NF-κB activation, viruses encode several specific NF-κB inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins.

While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.","Fenrich, Matija; Mrdenovic, Stefan; Balog, Marta; Tomic, Svetlana; Zjalic, Milorad; Roncevic, Alen; Mandic, Dario; Debeljak, Zeljko; Heffer, Marija",Front Cell Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848621/,36

Mathematical models can be used to evaluate the possible impact of programmatic delays on hepatitis disease burden. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the incremental change in hepatitis C liver-related deaths and liver cancer, following a 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year hiatus in hepatitis elimination program progress. METHODS: Previously developed models were adapted for 110 countries to include a status quo or “no delay” scenario and a “1-year delay” scenario assuming significant disruption in interventions (screening, diagnosis and treatment) in the year 2020. Annual, country-level, model outcomes were extracted, and weighted averages were used to calculate regional (WHO and World Bank Income Group) and global estimates from 2020 to 2030. The incremental annual change in outcomes was calculated by subtracting the “no-delay” estimates from the “1-year delay” estimates. RESULTS: The “1-year delay” scenario resulted in 44,800 (95% UI: 43,800 – 49,300) excess hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and 72,300 (95% UI: 70,600 – 79,400) excess liver-related deaths (LRDs), relative to the “no delay” scenario globally, from 2020-2030. Most missed treatments would be in lower-middle income countries, while most excess HCC and LRDs would be among high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond the direct morbidity and mortality associated with exposure and infection. In order to mitigate the impact on viral hepatitis programming and reduce excess mortality from delayed treatment, policy makers should prioritize hepatitis programs as soon as it becomes safe to do so.","Blach, Sarah; Kondili, Loreta A.; Aghemo, Alessio; Cai, Zongzhen; Dugan, Ellen; Estes, Chris; Gamkrelidze, Ivane; Ma, Siya; Pawlotsky, Jean Michel; Razavi-Shearer, Devin; Razavi, Homie; Waked, Imam; Zeuzem, Stefan; Craxi, Antonio",J Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32777322/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827820305237; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2020.07.042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827820305237?v=s5,36
689213,Waiting for other people: a psychoanalytic interpretation of the time for action,2020-06-10,"COVID-19 first presented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Thought to be of zoonotic origin, it has been named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and has spread rapidly. As of April 20(th), 2020, there have been more than 2.4 million cases recorded worldwide. The inflammatory process, cytokine storm, and lung injury that are associated with COVID-19 can put patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. It is uncertain what the total incidences of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients is currently at. Those with more severe disease and with other risk factors, including increasing age, male sex, obesity, cancer, comorbidities, and intensive care unit admission, are at higher risk of these events. However, there is little international guidance on managing these risks in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we explore the current evidence and theories surrounding thrombosis in these unique patients and reflect on experience from our center.","Khan, Inayat Hussain; Savarimuthu, Sugeevan; Tsun Leung, Marco Shiu; Harky, Amer",J Vasc Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420311575; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420311575?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417304/,36

This paper discusses a number of questions that should be addressed when assessing the ethical challenges of mobile applications for digital contact-tracing of COVID-19: Which safeguards should be designed in the technology? Who should access data? What is a legitimate role for “Big Tech” companies in the development and implementation of these systems? How should cultural and behavioural issues be accounted for in the design of these apps? Should use of these apps be compulsory? What does transparency and ethical oversight mean in this context? We demonstrate that responses to these questions are complex and contingent and argue that if digital contract-tracing is used, then it should be clear that this is on a trial basis and its use should be subject to independent monitoring and evaluation.","Lucivero, Federica; Hallowell, Nina; Johnson, Stephanie; Prainsack, Barbara; Samuel, Gabrielle; Sharon, Tamar",J Bioeth Inq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840842/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10016-9,36
689639,Is G-CSF Dangerous in COVID-19: Why Not Use GM-CSF?,2020-11-06,"We determined the molecular sequence of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to serogroups B and C capsular polysaccharides (PS) of Neisseria meningitidis. N. meningitidis infections are a leading cause of bacterial septicemia and meningitis in humans. Antibodies to PS are fundamental to host defense and diagnostics. The polysaccharide capsule of group B N. meningitidis is poorly immunogenic and thus is an important model for studying pathogen-host co-evolution through understanding the molecular basis of the host immune response. We used a modified reverse-transcriptase PCR to amplify and sequence the V-genes of murine hybridomas produced against types B and C capsular PS. Databank analysis of the sequences encoding the V-genes of type C capsular PS mAb, 4-2-C, reveal that heavy chain alleles are recurrently used to encode this specificity in mice. Interestingly, a V-gene from the same germline family also encodes the V-domain of mAbs 2-2-B, which targets the antigenically distinct serogroup B capsular PS. Somatic mutation, junctional diversity and alternative light chains collectively impart the specificity for these serologically distinct epitopes. Knowledge of the specific immunoglobulin genes used to target common bacterial virulence factors may lead to insights on pathogen-host co-evolution, and the potential use of this information in pre-symptomatic diagnosis is discussed.","Berry, Jody D.; Boese, Darren J.; Law, Dennis K.S.; Zollinger, Wendell D.; Tsang, Raymond S.W.",Mol Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589004003359; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589004003359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15589322/,36
689968,How to Investigate a Serious Adverse Event Reported During a Clinical Trial for a COVID-19 Vaccine,2020-11-21,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), discovered in 2001, most commonly causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children, but is also a concern for elderly subjects and immune-compromised patients. hMPV is the major etiological agent responsible for about 5% to 10% of hospitalizations of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections. hMPV infection can cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, and its symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus. Initial infection with hMPV usually occurs during early childhood, but re-infections are common throughout life. Due to the slow growth of the virus in cell culture, molecular methods (such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)) are the preferred diagnostic modality for detecting hMPV. A few vaccine candidates have been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease, but none are yet commercially available. Our understanding of hMPV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we will review the currently available information on the molecular biology and epidemiology of hMPV. We will also review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to control hMPV infection, with an emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against hMPV.","Panda, Swagatika; Mohakud, Nirmal Kumar; Pena, Lindomar; Kumar, Subrat",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121401488X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197121401488X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841931/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.03.1394,36

690679,Endoscopy works during the pandemic of coronavirus COVID-19: recommendations by the Chinese Society of Digestive Endoscopy,2020-07-02,"Since December 2019 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced an outbreak of pulmonary disease which has soon became a global pandemic, known as COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19). The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV-1). Both coronaviruses also share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) one. In spite of these similarities, the new coronavirus has expanded more widely, more faster and more lethally than the previous one. Many researchers across the disciplines have used diverse modeling tools to analyze the impact of this pandemic at global and local scales. This includes a wide range of approaches–deterministic, data-driven, stochastic, agent-based, and their combinations–to forecast the progression of the epidemic as well as the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop or mitigate its impact on the world population. The physical complexities of modern society need to be captured by these models. This includes the many ways of social contacts–(multiplex) social contact networks, (multilayers) transport systems, metapopulations, etc.–that may act as a framework for the virus propagation. But modeling not only plays a fundamental role in analyzing and forecasting epidemiological variables. It plays an important role in helping to find cures for the disease and in preventing contagion by means of new vaccines. The necessity for answering swiftly and effectively to the questions: Could existing drugs work against SARS CoV-2? and Can new vaccines be developed in time?demands the use of physical modeling of proteins, protein-inhibitors interactions, virtual screening of drugs against virus targets, predicting immunogenicity of small peptides, modeling vaccinomics and vaccine design, to mention just a few. Here, we review these three main areas of modeling research against SARS CoV-2 and COVID-19: (1) epidemiology; (2) drug repurposing; and (3) vaccine design. Therefore, we compile the most relevant existing literature about modeling strategies against the virus to help modelers to navigate this fast-growing literature. We also keep an eye on future outbreaks, where the modelers can find the most relevant strategies used in an emergence situation as the current one to help in fighting future pandemics.","Estrada, Ernesto",Phys Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834430/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0370157320302544; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157320302544?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2020.07.005,36

690723,Virtual Interviews for the Complex General Surgical Oncology Fellowship: The Dana-Farber/Partners Experience,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, the use of lung ultrasonography (LUS) to diagnosis lung findings was evaluated in patients with suspected COVID-19 who were admitted to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This observational clinical study was conducted in the ED of the Ankara City Hospital during the period April 1–30, 2020. Patients who were admitted to the ED were triaged as COVID-19 infected and who agreed to undergo LUS/LCT (lung computed tomography) were included in the study. RESULTS: Included in the study were 40 patients who had been prediagnosed with COVID-19. Pneumonia was detected with LCT in 32 (80%) patients, while the LUS examination identified pneumonia in 23 patients. The most common finding in LCT was ground-glass opacity (n = 29, 90.6%). Of the 23 patients with pneumonia findings in LUS, 15 (65.2%) had direct consolidation. Among the 32 patients who were found to have pneumonia as a result of LCT, 20 (62.5%) had signs of pneumonia on LUS examination, and 12 had no signs of pneumonia. In addition, 3 patients showed no signs of pneumonia with LCT, but they were misdiagnosed with pneumonia by LUS. The sensitivity of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the COVID-19 patients was 62.5%, while its specificity was 62.5%. In addition, its positive predictive value was 87.0%, and its negative predictive value was 29.4%. CONCLUSION: LUS may also be used in the diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients because it is a valuable and accessible bedside diagnostic tool.
