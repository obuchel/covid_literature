162,162,162,Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population,14.652888,5.3951616,2008-07-09,"BACKGROUND: Governments are preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. Therefore they need data to assess the possible impact of interventions. Face-masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention, if effective when worn under routine circumstances. METHODOLOGY: We assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity, but with a high degree of individual variation. Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission.","van der Sande, Marianne; Teunis, Peter; Sabel, Rob",PLoS One,95,1
798,798,798,A scientometric analysis of Indian research output in medicine during 1999–2008,14.568544,5.5356994,2011,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the research activities of India in medicine during 1999–2008, based on the total publication output, its growth rate, quality of papers published and rank of India in the global context. Patterns of international collaborative research output and the major partner countries of India are also discussed. This study also evaluates the research performance of different types of Indian medical colleges, hospitals, research institutes, universities and research foundations and the characteristics of published literature in Indian and foreign journals. It also analyzes the medical research output by disease and organs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The publication data on medicine has been retrieved by using SCOPUS database. RESULTS: India holds 12th rank among the productive countries in medicine research consisting of 65,745 papers with a global publication share of 1.59% and registering a growth rate of 76.68% for the papers published during 1999–2003 to 2004–2008. CONCLUSION: High quality research in India is grossly inadequate and requires strategic planning, investment and resource support. There is also a need to improve the existing medical education system, which should foster research culture.","Gupta, B. M.; Bala, Adarsh",J Nat Sci Biol Med,95,19
1616,1616,1616,Growth Patterns and Scaling Laws Governing AIDS Epidemic in Brazilian Cities,14.806554,5.2017255,2014-10-23,"Brazil holds approximately 1/3 of population living infected with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in Central and South Americas, and it was also the first developing country to implement a large-scale control and intervention program against AIDS epidemic. In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number of inhabitants of cities. In this framework, our results give insights into the overall dynamics of AIDS epidemic, which may contribute to select empirically accurate models.","Antonio, Fernando Jose; de Picoli, Sergio; Teixeira, Jorge Juarez Vieira; Mendes, Renio dos Santos",PLoS One,95,1
4019,4019,4019,Global research trends in microbiome-gut-brain axis during 2009–2018: a bibliometric and visualized study,14.962504,5.256019,2019-08-30,"BACKGROUND: The pathways and mechanism by which associations between the gut microbiome and the brain, termed the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA), are manifest but remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the global activity within this rapidly developing field and to identify particular areas of focus that are of current relevance to the MGBA during the last decade (2009–2018). METHODS: The current study uses the Scopus for data collection. We used the key terms “microbiome-gut-brain axis” and its synonyms because we are concerned with MGBA per se as a new concept in research rather than related topics. A VOSviewer version 1.6.11 was used to visualize collaboration pattern between countries and authors, and evolving research topics by analysis of the term co-occurrence in the title and abstract of publications. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, there were 51,504 published documents related to the microbiome, including 1713 articles related to the MGBA: 829 (48.4%) original articles, 658(38.4%) reviews, and 226 (13.2%) other articles such as notes, editorials or letters. The USA took the first place with 385 appearances, followed by Ireland (n = 161), China (n = 155), and Canada (n = 144).The overall citation h-index was 106, and the countries with the highest h-index values were the USA (69), Ireland (58), and Canada (43). The cluster analysis demonstrated that the dominant fields of the MGBA include four clusters with four research directions: “modeling MGBA in animal systems”, “interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system”, “irritable bowel syndrome related to gut microbiota”, and “neurodegenerative diseases related to gut microbiota”. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the research on the MGBA has been becoming progressively more extensive at global level over the past 10 years. Overall, our study found that a large amount of work on MGBA focused on immunomodulation, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite considerable progress illustrating the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain over the past 10 years, many issues remain about their relevance for therapeutic intervention of many diseases.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.; Smale, Simon; Waring, W.

The extent to which special tailoring to the addressed subjects would be helpful in improving the effectiveness of prevention measures is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review is to assess gender-specific differences in primary prevention actions. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in 2015 by searching the PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane Library databases as well as adding additional studies by cross-referencing. The search focused on studies with an analysis of gender differences in health and risk behavior concerning primary prevention. Therefore, major exclusion criteria were single-gender studies, underage (<18 years) study collectives and secondary or tertiary prevention measures. RESULTS: In total, 23 studies from 13 different countries were included in the qualitative evaluation. The studies covered 11 different subtopics of primary prevention, but were too diverse in content and type to draw many fundamental conclusions. A meta-analysis was not possible. Generally a tendency for females to be more health-conscious and engaged in preventive behavior could be seen in most subgroups. CONCLUSION: The importance of gender-specific prevention measures for the healthcare system is being increasingly stressed, but only a few studies specifically analyzing the influence of gender on preventive behavior could be identified. To implement appropriate primary prevention measures tailored to gender-specific needs, more details and studies on gender differences are needed.","Hiller, Julia; Schatz, Kathrina; Drexler, Hans",Z Gesundh Wiss,95,1

Preeclampsia lacks effective therapies because of the poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. The aim of this paper is to review molecular signaling pathways that could be responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. METHOD OF STUDY: This article reviews the English-language literature for pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia based on genome-wide gene expression profiling and proteomic studies. RESULTS: We show that the expression of the genes and proteins involved in response to stress, host-pathogen interactions, immune system, inflammation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, growth and tissue remodeling was increased in preeclampsia. Several significant common pathways observed in preeclampsia overlap the datasets identified in TLR (Toll-like receptor)- and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-dependent signaling pathways. Placental oxidative stress and subsequent chronic inflammation are considered to be major contributors to the development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes recent advances in TLR- and RAGE-mediated signaling and the target molecules, and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.","Sado, Toshiyuki; Naruse, Katsuhiko; Noguchi, Taketoshi; Haruta, Shoji; Yoshida, Shozo; Tanase, Yasuhito; Kitanaka, Takashi; Oi, Hidekazu; Kobayashi, Hiroshi",Inflamm Res,95,1

Fifty-eight patients received allogeneic grafts, and 65 patients an autologous transplant. Fever developed in 107 (87%) children; 82% of infectious complications occurred during the neutropenic period. Documented infection developed in 33 (31%) patients, while 74 (69%) patients had possible infection (i.e. fever of unknown origin). The incidence of bacteremia was 21%, and gram-positive cocci were the predominant pathogens; non-bacteremic microbiologically documented infection developed in 6% of patients; clinically evident infection developed in 4% of subjects. The incidence of primary febrile episodes was not significantly different between autologous and allogeneic BMT (86% vs 88%); nor did the median number of days to the onset of fever (5 days in both groups) or the median duration of fever (5 days in both groups) differ. In contrast, the frequency of secondary febrile episodes was significantly higher (P=0.0001) in allogeneic BMT recipients (40%) than in autologous recipients (15%). The mortality rate due to infections was 2/36 (5%) for matched sibling donor BMT, and 1/13 (8%) for matched unrelated donor BMT. No deaths occurred in the 65 patients who were autografted. Invasive fungal infections accounted for 2 of the 3 infectious deaths. In conclusion, the majority of children undergoing BMT experienced at least one infectious episode; allogeneic BMT recipients were at high risk of developing secondary febrile episodes, but the overall mortality rate due to infection in the first 100 days after transplantation was low.","Busca, A.; Saroglia, Eugenia M.; Giacchino, Mareva; Vai, Sergio; Vassallo, Elena; Fagioli, Franca; Linari, Alessandra; Dotti, Giulia; Miniero, Roberto; Madon, Enrico",Support Care Cancer,95,1

These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]‐Q(avg), PEC‐Q(met), and PEC‐Q(sum)) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus‐based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose–response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose–response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC‐Q methods according to goodness‐of‐fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC‐Q(sum) followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat‐specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC‐Q(avg), and PEC‐Q(met) approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands. Computation differences between the various multi‐chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared.

Adaptive network models that account for both epidemic and behavioral change have found oscillations, but in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space, which contrasts with intuition and available data. In this paper we propose a simple susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model on an adaptive network with time-delayed rewiring, and show that oscillatory solutions are now present in a wide region of the parameter space. Altering the transmission or rewiring rates reveals the presence of an endemic bubble—an enclosed region of the parameter space where oscillations are observed.","Sherborne, N.; Blyuss, K.

If they are right, what are the alternatives? Some authors have suggested that we should go back to the old cardiopulmonary criterion of death and abandon the so-called Dead Donor Rule. Others argue for a pluralist solution. For example, Robert Veatch has defended a view that competent persons should be free to decide which criterion of death should be used to determine their death. However, there is very little data on people’s preferences about death determination criteria. We conducted online vignette-based survey with Latvian participants (N = 1416). The data suggest that the pluralist solution fits best with the way our study participants think about death determination—widely differing preferences concerning death determination criteria were observed. Namely, most participants choose one of the three criteria discussed in the literature: whole brain, higher brain, and cardiopulmonary. Interestingly, our data also indicate that study participants tend to prefer less restrictive criteria for determination of their own deaths than for determination of deaths of their closest relatives. Finally, the preferences observed in our sample are largely in accord with the Dead Donor Rule for organ procurement for transplantation.

Technological advancements are transforming how healthcare knowledge is expanding and accelerating the outreach of critical medical services delivery (Jamal et al. in Health Information Management Journal 38(3):26–37, 2009). While this transformation facilitates new opportunities simultaneously it also introduces challenges (Jacobzone and Oxley, 2001). Appropriate Health Technology (HT) is vital to new and existing global health care programs. Therefore, qualified professionals who can safely guide the development, evaluation, installation, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation of HT must be in position to lead. Trained Clinical Engineers (CE) and Biomedical Engineers (BE) have been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the essential practitioners to providing this critically needed guidance. Over the past four years, a senior professional group participated in an international project that seeks evidence for the hypothesis - that the engagement of CE and BE in guiding HT - impacts positively on patient outcomes, while the alternative is that there is no difference. The group collected published data that was subjected to peer review screening; additional data qualification conditions are described in this paper. The project was initiated at the Global CE Summit during the first International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress (ICEHTMC) in Hangzhou, China in October 2015 (Global Clinical Engineering Summit at the First International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress, 2015). Following the adoption of a resolution to investigate CE contributions to the improvement of world health status, an international survey and literature survey were initiated. During the first two years of this project 150 case studies from 90 countries were identified covering the previous ten years. The results of this survey were presented to health leaders at the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Assembly in 2016. Last year, 250 case studies were added including 35 more countries covering the 2016–2017 period. The combined project contains 400 qualified submissions from 125 countries. The conclusion was that engagement of CE and BME is critical for successful investment in HT and for achieving intended patient outcomes.

Previous studies showed that the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway is functionally linked to nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, suggesting that vRNP export is a signaling-induced event. However, the underlying mechanism remained completely enigmatic. Here we have dissected the unknown molecular steps of signaling-driven vRNP export. We identified kinases RSK1/2 as downstream targets of virus-activated ERK signaling. While RSK2 displays an antiviral role, we demonstrate a virus-supportive function of RSK1, migrating to the nucleus to phosphorylate nucleoprotein (NP), the major constituent of vRNPs. This drives association with viral matrix protein 1 (M1) at the chromatin, important for vRNP export. Inhibition or knockdown of MEK, ERK or RSK1 caused impaired vRNP export and reduced progeny virus titers. This work not only expedites the development of anti-influenza strategies, but in addition demonstrates converse actions of different RSK isoforms.","Schreiber, André; Boff, Laurita; Anhlan, Darisuren; Krischuns, Tim; Brunotte, Linda; Schuberth, Christian; Wedlich-Söldner, Roland; Drexler, Hannes; Ludwig, Stephan",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,95,1

Our hypothesis is that generalized OA is another facet of the metabolic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical ethical review board of our institution approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to the study. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the knee were obtained in 42 patients who had been diagnosed with generalized OA at multiple joint sites. Another 27 MR images of the knee were obtained from a matched normal (non-OA) reference population. Vessel wall thickness of the popliteal artery was quantitatively measured by dedicated software. Linear regression models were used to investigate the association between vessel wall thickness and generalized OA. Adjustments were made for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Confidence intervals (CI) were computed at the 95% level and a significance level of α = 0.05 was used. RESULTS: Patients in the generalized OA population had a significant higher average vessel wall thickness than persons from the normal reference population (p ≤ α), even when correction was made for sex, age, and BMI. The average vessel wall thickness of the popliteal artery was 1.09 mm in patients with generalized OA, and 0.96 mm in the matched normal reference population. CONCLUSION: The association found between increased popliteal artery vessel wall thickness and generalized osteoarthritis suggests that generalized OA might be another facet of the metabolic syndrome.","Kornaat, Peter R.; Sharma, Ruby; van der Geest, Rob J.; Lamb, Hildo J.; Kloppenburg, Margreet; Hellio le Graverand, Marie-Pierre; Bloem, Johan L.; Watt, Iain",Skeletal Radiol,95,1

METHODS: A total of 212 AMA-positive serum samples were classified into four groups: PBC (definite PBC, n = 93); PBC/autoimmune disease (AID; PBC plus other AID, n = 37); biochemically normal (BN) individuals (n = 61); and BN/AID (BN plus other AID, n = 21). Samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on rat kidney (IIF-AMA) and ELISA [antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase E2-complex (PDC-E2), gp-210, Sp-100, and CENP-A/B]. AMA isotype was determined by IIF-AMA. Affinity of anti-PDC-E2 IgG was determined by 8 M urea-modified ELISA. RESULTS: High-titer IIF-AMA was more frequent in PBC and PBC/AID (57 and 70 %) than in BN and BN/AID samples (23 and 19 %) (p < 0.001). Triple isotype IIF-AMA (IgA/IgM/IgG) was more frequent in PBC and PBC/AID samples (35 and 43 %) than in BN sample (18 %; p = 0.008; p = 0.013, respectively). Anti-PDC-E2 levels were higher in PBC (mean 3.82; 95 % CI 3.36–4.29) and PBC/AID samples (3.89; 3.15–4.63) than in BN (2.43; 1.92–2.94) and BN/AID samples (2.52; 1.54–3.50) (p < 0.001). Anti-PDC-E2 avidity was higher in PBC (mean 64.5 %; 95 % CI 57.5–71.5 %) and PBC/AID samples (66.1 %; 54.4–77.8 %) than in BN samples (39.2 %; 30.9–37.5 %) (p < 0.001). PBC and PBC/AID recognized more cell domains (mitochondria, nuclear envelope, PML/sp-100 bodies, centromere) than BN (p = 0.008) and BN/AID samples (p = 0.002).

Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of AB38b, a novel synthetic α, β-unsaturated ketone compound, on the oxidative stress (OS) and ECM accumulation in type 2 diabetes mice, and tried to clarify the mechanisms underlying the effects in high glucose (HG, 30 mm)-treated mouse glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Type 2 diabetes model was established in mice with high-fat diet feeding combined with streptozocin intraperitoneal administration. The diabetic mice were then treated with AB38b (10, 20, 40 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ig) or a positive control drug resveratrol (40 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), ig) for 8 weeks. We showed that administration of AB38b or resveratrol prevented the increases in malondialdehyde level, lactate dehydrogenase release, and laminin and type IV collagen deposition in the diabetic kidney. Simultaneously, AB38b or resveratrol markedly lowered the level of Keap1, accompanied by evident activation of Nrf2 signaling in the diabetic kidney. The underlying mechanisms of antioxidant effect of AB38b were explored in HG-treated mouse GMCs. AB38b (2.5−10 μM) or resveratrol (10 μM) significantly alleviated OS and ECM accumulation in HG-treated GMCs. Furthermore, AB38b or resveratrol treatment effectively activated Nrf2 signaling by inhibiting Keap1 expression without affecting the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2. Besides, AB38b treatment effectively suppressed the ubiquitination of Nrf2. Taken together, this study demonstrates that AB38b ameliorates experimental DN through antioxidation and modulation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.","Du, Lei; Wang, Lei; Wang, Bo; Wang, Jin; Hao, Meng; Chen, Yi-bing; Li, Xi-zhi; Li, Yuan; Jiang, Yan-fei; Li, Cheng-cheng; Yang, Hao; Gu, Xiao-ke; Yin, Xiao-xing; Lu, Qian",Acta Pharmacol Sin,95,1

A modelling study to predict future cases,14.599645,5.279501,2020-08-24,"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) compared to conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation (MV) decreases duration of MV and mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in patients with ARF from several etiologies. Intubated patients ventilated for ≤ 5 days expected to require MV for ≥ 72 h and able to breathe spontaneously were eligible for enrollment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced treatment assignments with a computerized randomization allocation sequence to two ventilatory strategies: (1) lung-protective MV (control group), and (2) lung-protective MV with NAVA (NAVA group). Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days. Secondary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Between March 2014 and October 2019, we enrolled 306 patients and randomly assigned 153 patients to the NAVA group and 153 to the control group. Median VFDs were higher in the NAVA than in the control group (22 vs. 18 days; between-group difference 4 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 8 days; p = 0.016). At hospital discharge, 39 (25.5%) patients in the NAVA group and 47 (30.7%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference − 5.2%, 95% CI − 15.2 to 4.8, p = 0.31). Other clinical, physiological or safety outcomes did not differ significantly between the trial groups. CONCLUSION: NAVA decreased duration of MV although it did not improve survival in ventilated patients with ARF.

Implementing WGS into clinical practice will place an increased burden upon care teams with regard to pre-test patient education and counseling about results. To quantitate the time needed for appropriate pre-test evaluation of participants in WGS testing, we documented the time spent by our clinical research group on various activities related to program preparation, participant screening, and consent prior to WGS. Participants were children or young adults with autism, intellectual or developmental disability, and/or congenital anomalies, who have remained undiagnosed despite previous evaluation, and their biologic parents. Results showed that significant time was spent in securing allocation of clinical research space to counsel participants and families, and in acquisition and review of participant’s medical records. Pre-enrollment chart review identified two individuals with existing diagnoses resulting in savings of $30,000 for the genome sequencing alone, as well as saving hours of personnel time for genome interpretation and communication of WGS results. New WGS programs should plan for costs associated with additional pre-test administrative planning and patient evaluation time that will be required to provide high quality care.

Notably, despite the different clinical characteristics of DD and schizophrenia (SZ), antipsychotics are deemed equally effective pharmaceutical treatments for both conditions. In this context, dopamine dysregulation may be transdiagnostic of the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders such as DD and SZ. In this study, an examination is made of the dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC) of patients with SZ, DD, other psychotic disorders, and the DSC of healthy subjects. Fifty-four subjects were recruited to the study, comprising 35 subjects with first-episode psychosis (11 DD, 12 SZ, 12 other psychotic disorders) and 19 healthy controls. All received an (18)F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) scan to measure DSC (K(occ;30–60) value) within 1 month of starting antipsychotic treatment. Clinical assessments were also made, which included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) measurements. The mean K(occ;30–60) was significantly greater in the caudate region of subjects in the DD group (ES = 0.83, corrected p = 0.048), the SZ group (ES = 1.40, corrected p = 0.003) and the other psychotic disorder group (ES = 1.34, corrected p = 0.0045), compared to that of the control group. These data indicate that DD, SZ, and other psychotic disorders have similar dysregulated mechanisms of dopamine synthesis, which supports the utility of abnormal dopamine synthesis in transdiagnoses of these psychotic conditions.","Cheng, Pak Wing Calvin; Chang, Wing Chung; Lo, Gladys G.; Chan, Kit Wa Sherry; Lee, Ho Ming Edwin; Hui, Lai Ming Christy; Suen, Yi Nam; Leung, Yim Lung Eric; Au Yeung, Kai Ming Paul; Chen, Sirong; Mak, Ka Fung Henry; Sham, Pak Chung; Santangelo, Barbara; Veronese, Mattia; Ho, Chi-Lai; Chen, Yu Hai Eric; Howes, Oliver D.",Neuropsychopharmacology,95,1

Mucosal vaccine delivery is an attractive option as it directly targets the site of infection; however, preclinical development has been hindered by a lack of suitable mucosal adjuvants and a limited understanding of their immune effects in the lung environment. Herein, we define the early immune events following the intrapulmonary delivery of a vaccine incorporating the adjuvant delta-inulin. Analysis of the early inflammatory response showed vaccine-induced innate cell recruitment to lungs and local lymph nodes (LN) was transient and non-polarised, correlating with an increase in pulmonary chemotactic factors. Use of fluorescently labelled adjuvant revealed widespread tissue dissemination of adjuvant particles, coupled with broad cellular uptake and transit to the lung-draining LN by a range of innate immune cells. Mass cytometric analysis revealed extensive phenotypic changes in innate and adaptive cell subsets induced by vaccination; this included identification of unconventional lymphocytes such as γδ-T cells and MAIT cells that increased following vaccination and displayed an activated phenotype. This study details a comprehensive view of the immune response to intrapulmonary adjuvant administration and provides pre-clinical evidence to support delta-inulin as a suitable adjuvant for pulmonary vaccines.","Ferrell, Kia C.; Stewart, Erica L.; Counoupas, Claudio; Ashhurst, Thomas M.; Britton, Warwick J.; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Triccas, James A.",Mucosal Immunol,95,1

These sediments deposit at different places depending on the discharge and course of the river. However, the deposition of these sediments impacts environmental health, agricultural activities, and portable water sources. Deposition of suspended sediments reduces the flow area, thus affecting the movement of aquatic lives and ultimately leading to the change of river course. Thus, the data of suspended sediments and their variation is crucial information for various authorities. Various authorities require the forecasted data of suspended sediments in the river to operate various hydraulic structures properly. Usually, the prediction of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is challenging due to various factors, including site-related data, site-related modelling, lack of multiple observed factors used for prediction, and pattern complexity.Therefore, to address previous problems, this study proposes a Long Short Term Memory model to predict suspended sediments in Malaysia's Johor River utilizing only one observed factor, including discharge data. The data was collected for the period of 1988–1998. Four different models were tested, in this study, for the prediction of suspended sediments, which are: ElasticNet Linear Regression (L.R.), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory. Predictions were analysed based on four different scenarios such as daily, weekly, 10-daily, and monthly. Performance evaluation stated that Long Short-Term Memory outperformed other models with the regression values of 92.01%, 96.56%, 96.71%, and 99.45% daily, weekly, 10-days, and monthly scenarios, respectively.","AlDahoul, Nouar; Essam, Yusuf; Kumar, Pavitra; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Sherif, Mohsen; Sefelnasr, Ahmed; Elshafie, Ahmed",Sci Rep,95,28

To alleviate the phenomenon of congestion at urban traffic intersections and relieve the traffic pressure at intersections, this paper takes the traffic flow at intersections as the research object and adopts the swarm intelligent algorithm to establish an optimization model of intersection traffic signal timing, which takes the average delay time of vehicles, the average number of stops of vehicles and the traffic capacity as the evaluation indexes. This model adjusts the intersection traffic signal timing intelligence according to the real-time traffic flow and carries out simulation experiments with MATLAB. Compared with the traditional timing schemes, the average delay time of vehicles is reduced by 10.25%, the average number of stops of vehicles is reduced by 24.55%, and the total traffic capacity of the intersection is increased by 3.56%, which verifies that the scheme proposed in this paper is effective in relieving traffic congestion.","Fu, Xiancheng; Gao, Hengqiang; Cai, Hongjuan; Wang, Zhihao; Chen, Weiming",Sensors (Basel),95,1

She was put on a mechanical ventilator when she developed respiratory failure. Initially, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was considered. After admission to the intensive care unit, severe mitral stenosis was diagnosed with the help of echocardiography. She was managed successfully for congestive heart failure and discharged from the intensive care unit with improvement. CONCLUSION: The possibility of mitral stenosis, as a differential diagnosis, should be considered whenever a case of postpartum maternal collapse is encountered. We recommend a routine immediate echocardiography in any patient that experiences postpartum collapse, especially in the presence of a known trigger for heart failure such as long hours of labor, bleeding, anemia, hypotension, and infection.","Fessehaye, Abraham; Tafere, Yared Teshome; Abate, Desalegn Degafu",J Med Case Rep,95,17

In the context of under-served communities, a collaborative approach and mentorship between preschool teachers and Speech-Language Therapists (SLTs) promote language and literacy development. OBJECTIVES: This article’s purpose is two-fold; firstly, to discuss the use of environmental print as a stimulus material to promote emergent literacy in preschoolers in under-served preschools. Secondly, to promote the SLT’s involvement in such education initiatives. METHOD: A mixed-method, comparative intervention research design, was reported in this article. A pre- and post-test design was employed, with data collected before and after a teacher-based intervention. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group displayed increased scores on the Concepts About Print (CAP) assessment, participants in the comparison group showed no change in scores using the same assessment over the same time period.

CaMKII activity is promoted by both oxidation and O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) of known CaMKII sites. OBJECTIVE: To investigate which posttranslational modifications occur in human diabetic hearts and how they alter electrophysiological and Ca(2+) handling properties in hyperglycemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed echocardiography, electrophysiology, Ca(2+)-handling, and protein expression in site-specific CaMKII mutant mice (O-GlcNAc-resistant S280A and oxidation-resistant MM281/2VV knock-ins, and global and cardiac-specific knockouts), in myocytes subjected to acute hyperglycemia and Ang II (angiotensin II) and mice after streptozotocin injections (to induce diabetes). Human patients with diabetes exhibit elevated CaMKII O-GlcNAcylation but not oxidation. In mice, acute hyperglycemia increased spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) sparks and waves and arrhythmogenic action potential changes (prolongation, alternans, and delayed afterdepolarizations), all of which required CaMKII-S280 O-GlcNAcylation. Ang II effects were dependent on NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-mediated CaMKII MM281/2 oxidation. Diabetes led to much greater Ca(2+) leak, RyR2 S2814 phosphorylation, electrophysiological remodeling, and increased susceptibility to in vivo arrhythmias, requiring CaMKII activation, predominantly via S280 O-GlcNAcylation and less via MM281/2 oxidation. These effects were present in myocytes at normal glucose but were exacerbated with the in vivo high circulating glucose. PLB (phospholamban) O-GlcNAcylation was increased and coincided with reduced PLB S16 phosphorylation in diabetes. Dantrolene, which reverses CaMKII-dependent proarrhythmic RyR-mediated Ca(2+) leak, also prevented hyperglycemia-induced APD prolongation and delayed afterdepolarizations. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CaMKII-S280 O-GlcNAcylation is required for increased arrhythmia susceptibility in diabetic hyperglycemia, which can be worsened by an additional Ang II-NOX2-CaMKII MM281/2 oxidation pathway. CaMKII-dependent RyR2 S2814 phosphorylation markedly increases proarrhythmic Ca(2+) leak and PLB O-GlcNAcylation may limit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) reuptake, leading to impaired excitation-contraction coupling and arrhythmogenesis in diabetic hyperglycemia.","Hegyi, Bence; Fasoli, Anna; Ko, Christopher Y.; Van, Benjamin W.; Alim, Chidera C.; Shen, Erin Y.; Ciccozzi, Marisa M.; Tapa, Srinivas; Ripplinger, Crystal M.; Erickson, Jeffrey R.; Bossuyt, Julie; Bers, Donald M.",Circ Res,95,1

SGM people, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, experience disproportionate HIV infection across the globe. The objective of this commentary was to synthesize facilitators of and barriers to SGM health training efforts for healthcare workers in Uganda, in order to help inform potential priorities, strategies and next steps to advance culturally responsive HIV‐related care for SGM communities across Uganda and sub‐Saharan Africa. DISCUSSION: SGM health training often includes education on: foundational concepts and language; stigma, discrimination and SGM health disparities; understanding and addressing implicit bias; sensitive and effective communication and building SGM‐inclusive and welcoming healthcare environments. Clinicians’ education includes sexual and gender histories, sex‐positive HIV counselling, sexually transmitted infections, HIV pre‐exposure prophylaxis and gender‐affirming hormone therapy. SGM communities in sub‐Saharan Africa have often experienced discrimination, persecution, incarceration and physical violence, and they encounter unique barriers to engagement in sexual health services and HIV prevention and treatment. SGM health training efforts in Uganda reveal challenges to and opportunities for advancing equity for SGM communities in sexual health and HIV medical care across the region. In Uganda, SGM community advocacy, as well as policies and programmes of the Ministry of Health and US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, have increased readiness and need for scaling up training and skills‐sharing in SGM‐focused HIV and sexual healthcare, including Ugandan‐led and international initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous challenges exist to widespread culturally responsive HIV and sexual healthcare for SGM communities in sub‐Saharan Africa. Lessons learned from healthcare worker training efforts in Uganda may inform future replication, adaptation and dissemination initiatives to meet the needs of more SGM communities in the region. Evaluation of SGM health training programmes to determine the impact on HIV virological suppression and sexual health outcomes will be critical for identifying best practices and strategies that may support advancing HIV epidemic control for SGM communities in Uganda and across sub‐Saharan Africa.","Keuroghlian, Alex S; Mujugira, Andrew; Mayer, Kenneth H",J Int AIDS Soc,95,1

The disease presents with productive cough, wheezing, episodic fever, as well as central bronchiectasis (CB) and mucus plugs on computed tomography (CT) scans. If treated accordingly, symptoms and pulmonary damage caused by ABPA can be reverted. Currently, the diagnostic criteria for ABPA require the diagnosis of predisposing pulmonary diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF) in order to establish the diagnosis. There has been an increasing number of cases reporting ABPA without evidence of past asthmatic history or symptoms. This reflects the need for more sensitive diagnostic tests in order to prevent progression to irreversible lung injury.

Here we show that urban land, water, and grassland are positively related to human well-being, whereas bare land is negatively associated in Japan. A 1 [Formula: see text] increase in the area of urban land per capita in a city is equivalent to an about 346 USD increase in the individual annual income of all the people in the city.

A major driver of AMR and poor clinical outcomes is suboptimal antimicrobial use. Current research in AMR is inequitably focused on new drug development. To achieve antimicrobial security we need to balance AMR research efforts between development of new agents and strategies to preserve the efficacy and maximise effectiveness of existing agents. Combining a review of current evidence and multistage engagement with diverse international stakeholders (including those in healthcare, public health, research, patient advocacy and policy) we identified research priorities for optimising antimicrobial use in humans across four broad themes: policy and strategic planning; medicines management and prescribing systems; technology to optimise prescribing; and context, culture and behaviours.

Implementing this strategy for AMR research on the optimisation of antimicrobial use in humans could contribute to equitable global health security.","Charani, Esmita; McKee, Martin; Ahmad, Raheelah; Balasegaram, Manica; Bonaconsa, Candice; Merrett, Gemma Buckland; Busse, Reinhard; Carter, Vanessa; Castro-Sanchez, Enrique; Franklin, Bryony D; Georgiou, Pantelis; Hill-Cawthorne, Kerri; Hope, William; Imanaka, Yuichi; Kambugu, Andrew; Leather, Andrew JM; Mbamalu, Oluchi; McLeod, M; Mendelson, Marc; Mpundu, Mirfin; Rawson, Timothy M; Ricciardi, Walter; Rodriguez-Manzano, Jesus; Singh, Sanjeev; Tsioutis, Constantinos; Uchea, Chibuzor; Zhu, Nina; Holmes, Alison H",Lancet Reg Health Eur,95,1

OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to select target compounds from herbs for a pharmacokinetic study using network pharmacology, which could be applied in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, UPLC/Q Exactive Q-Orbitrap and GCMS 2010 were used to determine the non-volatile and volatile ingredients of TWMM. Based on the identified compounds, network pharmacology was used to screen the key compounds and targets of TWMM in the treatment of DR. Based on the compound-target-pathway network and identification of components emigrant into blood, the potential compound markers in vivo were chosen. Then, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administrated of TWMM at a 9.6 g/kg dose to investigating pharmacokinetic parameters using the UPLC-QQQ-MS. RESULTS: Ninety and forty-five compounds were identified by UPLC-MS and GC-MS, respectively. Based on the network pharmacology, nine compounds with a degree value above 15 were screened and implied that these compounds are the most active in DR treatment. Moreover, criteria of degree value greater than 7 were applied, and PTGS2, NOS2, AKT1, ESR1, TNF, and MAPK14 were inferred as the core targets in treating DR. After identification of components absorbed into blood, luteolin and formononetin were selected and used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of TWMM after its oral administration. CONCLUSIONS: The reported strategy provides a method that combines ingredient profiling, network pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics to determine luteolin and formononetin as the pharmacokinetic markers of TWMM. This strategy provides a clinically relevant methodology that allows for the screening of pharmacokinetic markers in Chinese medicines.","Wang, Yucheng; Xue, Beibei; Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Qilong; Liu, Erwei; Chen, Xiaopeng",,95,1

As of February 28, 2018, 2,182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide. The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MERS-CoV infection as well as determine its clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective-observational study of all laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the State of Qatar from January, 2012 to April 2018. We used the Fast Track diagnostics real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), targeting the upE and ORF1a genes respectively. Demographics, clinical information, potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence was 1.7 per 100,0000 person-years. Among the 24 confirmed cases of of MERS-CoV, males constituted the vast majority of cases (23 males) with a median age of 52 years (range 22–74). Fifty percent of the cases were Qatari and 42% reside in the same region. 67% of the cases had contact with camels, and 21% had contact with MERS-CoV-infected patient. Thirty-eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Fifty percent were smokers and 42% had comorbidities. The median symptoms duration was 4.5 days. Most of the patient presented with flu-like symptoms, were fever was the most common presentation, followed by cough, SOB, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache, 96%, 83%, 33%, 8%, 8% and 4%, respectively. All patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days (8–97). Forty-five percent patients developed severe sepsis with multi-organ failure and needed ICU admission. Fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury, 29% patients were on hemodialysis and 16% needed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Thirty-three percent patients died. The rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home. Among those who died all had one or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection is a rare infection in the State of Qatar, seen in both Qataris and expatriates with and without travel history. The infection in patients with comorbidities carries high mortality.

There is limited data regarding the role of rapid PCR testing for RVI and its effect on antibiotic duration and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective chart review in adult patients who were admitted and underwent evaluation with the FilmArray Multiplex Respiratory Panel (RP) (Biomerieux™) using a random sample from July 1, 2016 through April 1, 2018. Patient clinical and virologic characteristics, LOS, antibiotic use, and duration of treatment were collected. A Student’s t-test was performed for all comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 540 patients who were admitted and underwent RP testing. The mean age was 57.1 years (range 19–99), 50.2% were immunocompromised, 23.8% were transplant recipients, 70.4% had respiratory symptoms, and 35.7% had an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia. 55.6% required supplemental O(2) and 24.6% had an ICU admission that required either noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. 22.6% (N = 122) of these patients were diagnosed with an RVI, of which 15 were co-infected with two or more respiratory viruses. There were 41 (34%) rhinovirus/enterovirus, 41 (34%) influenza (Types A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2209, and B), 16 (13%) RSV, 15 (12%) coronavirus (Types NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1), 13 (11%) metapneumovirus, and 7 (5%) parainfluenza (Types 2, 3, and 4). 85.2% (104/122) of patients with an RVI received antibiotics. The mean LOS and antibiotic duration were 9.07 days and 7.31 days for patients with an RVI when compared with 11.5 days and 10.4 days for patients without an RVI (P = 0.098; P = 0.032), respectively. In patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures, the mean LOS was 8.4 days and mean antibiotic duration was 5.9 days when compared with 16.4 days and 15.5 days for all patients with positive bacterial cultures (P = 0.003; P < 0.0001), respectively. The mean time from available results of + RP to antibiotic discontinuation was 5.1 days in the setting of negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSION: Although antibiotic exposure and time to discontinuation still remained significant in patients diagnosed with an RVI, there was a marked reduction in LOS and antibiotic duration in the subset of patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures.

Embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) play key roles in the innate recognition and wound healing in reproductive tissues. METHODS: Based on the relative toxicities of different inorganic metals and inorganic nonmetallic compounds against murine and chicken EF cells, mechanistic estimations were performed based on transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: Lead (II) acetate induced preferential injuries in the chicken EF and mechanistic analyses using transcriptome revealed that chemokine receptor-associated events are potently involved in metal-induced adverse actions. As an early sentinel of metal exposure, the precision-cut intestine slices (PCIS) induced the expression of chemokines including CXCLi1 or CXCLi2, which were potent gut-derived factors that activate chemokine receptors in reproductive organs after circulation. CONCLUSION: EF-selective metals can be estimated to trigger the chemokine circuit in the gut-reproductive axis of chickens. This in vitro methodology using PCIS-EF culture could be used as a promising alternate platform for the reproductive immunotoxicological assessment.","Kim, Ki Hyung; Kim, Juil; Han, Jae Yong; Moon, Yuseok",Mol Cell Toxicol,95,1

This chapter focuses on the contentious clinical and research domain of transpecies transplantation, or xenotransplantation. Where the previous chapter was primarily concerned with the biopolitics of immunitary circuits between humans, this discussion turns towards our changing biotechnological relationship to other species, other immunitary animals. Whilst the approach may well offer a therapeutically life-saving solution for transplant patients, it potentially provides a means of transferring contagious diseases across species barriers. The chapter explores, with reference to Derrida and Sloterdijk, the tendency of immunitary purification and protection to recoil back upon their original designs. The chapter asks what might it mean to place trust in, or have confidence in, biosecurity measures that make the realisation of a threat (pandemics, xenozoonotic disease outbreaks, etc) more possible, not less so.","Brown, Nik",Immunitary Life,95,1

Recent studies have furthermore identified a number of host cell proteins and lipids contributing to the biogenesis of the membranous web, which are discussed in this chapter. Viral RNA synthesis is tightly associated with these membrane alterations and mainly driven by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. We summarize our current knowledge of the structure and function of NS5B, the role of cis-acting replication elements at the termini of the genome in regulating RNA synthesis and the contribution of additional viral and host factors to viral RNA synthesis, which is still ill defined.","Romero-Brey, Inés; Lohmann, Volker",Hepatitis C Virus I,95,1

Understanding and leveraging the newly developed capabilities afforded by emerging biotechnologies require knowledge about cutting-edge research and its real or proposed application(s), the process through which biotechnologies advance, and the educational and research infrastructure that promotes multi-disciplinary science. Innovation in research and technology development are driven by sector-specific needs and the convergence of the physical, chemical, material, computer, engineering, and/or life sciences. Biotechnologies developed for other sectors could be applied to biodefense, especially if the individuals involved are able to innovate in concept design and development. Of all biodefense objectives, biosurveillance seems to have reaped the most benefit from emerging biotechnologies, specifically the integration and analysis of diverse clinical, biological, demographic, and other relevant data. More recently, scientists have begun applying synthetic biology, genomics, and microfluidics to the development of new products and platforms for MCMs. Unlike these objectives, investments in microbial forensics have been few, limiting its ability to harness biotechnology advances for collecting and analyzing data.

We present a new framework to improve keyphrase extraction by utilizing additional supporting contextual information. We retrieve this additional information from other sentences within the same document. To this end, we propose Document-level Attention for Keyphrase Extraction (DAKE), which comprises Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks that capture hidden semantics in text, a document-level attention mechanism to incorporate document level contextual information, gating mechanisms which help to determine the influence of additional contextual information on the fusion with local contextual information, and Conditional Random Fields which capture output label dependencies.

It discusses various characteristics of the families of viruses. Viruses are defined by the sum of the distinctive traits of the virion. These distinctive traits are as follows: (1) presence of a single nucleic acid; (2) incapacity to grow and to divide; (3) reproduction from the genetic material only; (4) absence of enzymes for energy metabolism; (5) absence of ribosomes; (6) absence of information for the production of enzymes in the energy cycle; (7) absence of information for the synthesis of the ribosomal proteins; and (8) absence of information for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. The viral infectious particle presents a great diversity in composition and structure. Order could be achieved only through a classification, which is a system of order. The goal of biological classification is to group together organisms presenting certain analogies and certain affinities and, if possible, to also bring out phylogenic relationships. The conceptions relative to the methodology of taxonomy, which is the science of classification, are diverse. A virus may have evolved from a given sector of DNA within the host cell. It could also very well have derived from the corresponding RNA messenger that contains the same information, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, theoretically, different viruses could have originated from nucleic acids of different but complementary nature. The nucleic acid of viruses is either single- or double-stranded. Viruses, as is generally accepted, derive from the nucleic acid of their host. Thus, RNA viruses could possibly have their origin in the RNA messenger.","LWOFF, ANDRÉ; TOURNIER, PAUL",Comparative Virology,95,1

They allow us to reason about the use of components in a closed world setting, where components interact with known client code, and where the client code must establish the appropriate pre-conditions before calling into a component. Sufficient conditions are not enough to reason about the use of components in an open world setting, where components interact with external code, possibly of unknown provenance, and where components may evolve over time. In this open world setting, we must also consider the necessary conditions, i. e. what are the conditions without which an effect will not happen. In this paper we propose the [Formula: see text]hainmail specification language for writing holistic specifications that focus on necessary conditions (as well as sufficient conditions). We give a formal semantics for [Formula: see text]hainmail, and discuss several examples.

Two BV formulae can thus be translated into two LIA formulae and then an interpolation engine for LIA used to derive an interpolant, albeit one expressed in LIA. The construction is completed by back-translating the LIA interpolant into a BV formula whose models coincide with those of the LIA interpolant. This paper develops a back-translation algorithm showing, for the first time, how back-translation can be universally applied, whatever the LIA interpolant. This avoids the need for deriving a BV interpolant by bit-blasting the BV formulae, as a backup process when back-translation fails. The new back-translation process relies on a novel geometric technique, called gapping, the correctness and practicality of which are demonstrated.","Okudono, Takamasa; King, Andy",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,95,1

Recently, the lung infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has affected a larger human community globally, and due to its rapidity, the World-Health-Organisation (WHO) declared it as pandemic disease. The COVID-19 disease has adverse effects on the respiratory system, and the infection severity can be detected using a chosen imaging modality. In the proposed research work; the COVID-19 is detected using transfer learning from CT scan images decomposed to three-level using stationary wavelet. A three-phase detection model is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and the procedures are as follows; Phase1- data augmentation using stationary wavelets, Phase2- COVID-19 detection using pre-trained CNN model and Phase3- abnormality localization in CT scan images. This work has considered the well known pre-trained architectures, such as ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, and SqueezeNet for the experimental evaluation. In this work, 70% of images are considered to train the network and 30% images are considered to validate the network. The performance of the considered architectures is evaluated by computing the common performance measures. The result of the experimental evaluation confirms that the ResNet18 pre-trained transfer learning-based model offered better classification accuracy (training = 99.82%, validation = 97.32%, and testing = 99.4%) on the considered image dataset compared with the alternatives.","Ahuja, Sakshi; Panigrahi, Bijaya Ketan; Dey, Nilanjan; Rajinikanth, Venkatesan; Gandhi, Tapan Kumar",Appl Intell,95,16

We performed a systematic review on PEEP-induced recruited lung volume measured from inspiratory volume-pressure (VP) curves in ARDS patients to assess the prevalence of patients with PEEP-induced recruited lung volume and the mortality in recruiters and non-recruiters. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed to identify studies including ARDS patients in which the intervention of an increase in PEEP was accompanied by measurement of the recruited volume (V(rec) increase versus no increase) using the VP curve in order to assess the relation between V(rec) and mortality at ICU discharge. We first analysed the pooled data from the papers identified and then analysed individual patient level data received from the authors via personal contact. The risk of bias of the included papers was assessed using the quality in prognosis studies tool and the certainty of the evidence regarding the relationship of mortality to V(rec) by the GRADE approach. Recruiters were defined as patients with a V(rec) > 150 ml. A random effects model was used for the pooled data. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for individual patient data. RESULTS: We identified 16 papers with a total of 308 patients for the pooled data meta-analysis and 14 papers with a total of 384 patients for the individual data analysis. The quality of the articles was moderate. In the pooled data, the prevalence of recruiters was 74% and the mortality was not significantly different between recruiters and non-recruiters (relative risk 1.20 [95% confidence intervals 0.88–1.63]). The certainty of the evidence regarding this association was very low and publication bias evident. In the individual data, the prevalence of recruiters was 70%. In the multivariable logistic regression, V(rec) was not associated with mortality but Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and driving pressure at PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O were. CONCLUSION: After a PEEP increment, most patients are recruiters. V(rec) was not associated with ICU mortality. The presence of similar findings in the individual patient level analysis and the driving pressure at PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O was associated with mortality as previously reported validate our findings. Publication bias and the lack of prospective studies suggest more research is required.

Applying automated imaging and analysis to 263 essential gene knockdown mutants in an arrayed library, we derive robust, quantitative descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to inform investigations of gene function. Exploiting this observation, we infer the existence of a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation. Our results support the application of large-scale image-based analyses for mycobacterial functional genomics, simultaneously establishing the utility of this approach for drug mechanism-of-action studies.","de Wet, Timothy J; Winkler, Kristy R; Mhlanga, Musa; Mizrahi, Valerie; Warner, Digby F",,95,5

The following analysis considers - within a simple model - the potentially crucial role of a Corona testing approach in combination with a quarantine approach which is shown herein to be a substitute for broad lockdown measures. The cost of lockdowns/shutdowns are rather high so that – beyond progress in terms of a broad vaccination program – a rational testing strategy should also be carefully considered. Testing has to be organized on the basis of an adequate testing infrastructure which could largely be implemented in firms, schools, universities and public administration settings. As regards the cost of a systematic broad Covid-19 testing strategy, these could come close to 0.5% of national income if there are no vaccinations. The Testing & Quarantine approach suggested here – with tests for symptomatic as well as asymptomatic people - is based on a random sampling and would require rather broad and frequent testing; possibly one test per person every 7–10 days. At the same time, one should consider that the cost of further lockdowns/shutdowns of a duration of 1 month could be very high, such that a standard cost benefit analysis supports the testing approach suggested herein. Also, an optimal policy mix could be designed where both vaccinations and testing play a crucial role. As of late January 2021, no further lockdowns in Germany and other OECD countries would be necessary if a broad testing infrastructure can be established rather quickly. This in turn will reinforce economic optimism and help to jumpstart economic growth in Europe, the US and Asia in a solid way. The basic logic of the testing approach pointed out here for industrialized countries could also be applied in developing countries. The approach presented is complementary to the IMF analysis of Cherif/Hasanov.","Gries, Thomas; Welfens, Paul J. J.",Int Econ Econ Policy,95,1

The rule-based formalism of probabilistic timed graph transformation systems is a suitable choice when the models representing states of the system can be understood as graphs and timed and probabilistic behavior is important. However, model checking PTGTSs is limited to systems with rather small state spaces. We present an approach for the analysis of large-scale systems modeled as probabilistic timed graph transformation systems by systematically decomposing their state spaces into manageable fragments. To obtain qualitative and quantitative analysis results for a large-scale system, we verify that results obtained for its fragments serve as overapproximations for the corresponding results of the large-scale system. Hence, our approach allows for the detection of violations of qualitative and quantitative safety properties for the large-scale system under analysis. We consider a running example in which we model shuttles driving on tracks of a large-scale topology and for which we verify that shuttles never collide and are unlikely to execute emergency brakes.

The accumulative state fell short of a developmental state and so far failed to enact long-term industrial upgrading and reverse economic disintegration. The new accumulation strategy boosted precarious employment and reduced financial vulnerability at the price of increased inequality and weakened social, education and health policies.

During this time hospital outpatient appointments were conducted virtually (via telephone). This project aimed to assess patients experience of Covid19 cocooning and the virtual outpatient service. METHODS: Patients attending an outpatient geriatric medicine service were invited to participate in this project following their routine virtual assessment. A proforma questionnaire was administered to participants contacted virtually within one week of consent. Data was anonymised, imported into excel and analysed using SPSS (chi-squared test). RESULTS: 31 patients were included, median age was 83 years. 52% were male, 25% lived alone and 52% had cognitive impairment. 77% had heard of “cocooning”, of which 79% correctly understood the term. Three-quarters stated that cocooning had negatively impacted their quality of life (QoL); anxiety, loneliness and depression were reported in 49%, 36% and 29% respectively. 39% strongly feared getting Covid19. Cognition and living status did not correlate significantly with the psychological impact of Covid19. 61% did not use modern social media, its use did not impact QoL scores (p = 0.075). 45% experienced a reduction in support services. 87% found the OPD telephone service useful and 77% reported their needs were addressed. Three-quarters favoured future virtual assessments. CONCLUSION: One third of patients poorly understood “cocooning”.

It constitutes the main source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, and macro- and microelements in honeybee nutrition and it exerts antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, though research on these aspects has been limited so far. In this study 18 samples of Greek bee bread, two of which were monofloral, were collected during different seasons from diverse locations such as Crete and Mount Athos and were tested for their bioactivity. Samples were analyzed for their antibacterial properties, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC). The antimicrobial activity of each sample was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium. Our data demonstrate that all samples exert inhibitory and most of them bactericidal activity against at least two pathogens. Furthermore, all samples exert significant antioxidant activity, where the monofloral Castanea Sativa sample demonstrated superior antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity were not strongly correlated. Furthermore, machine learning methods demonstrated that the palynological composition of the samples is a good predictor of their TPC and ABTS activity. This is the first study that focuses on the biological properties of Greek bee bread and demonstrates that bee bread can be considered a functional food and a possible source of novel antimicrobial compounds.","Didaras, Nikos Asoutis; Kafantaris, Ioannis; Dimitriou, Tilemachos G.; Mitsagga, Chrysanthi; Karatasou, Katerina; Giavasis, Ioannis; Stagos, Dimitris; Amoutzias, Grigoris D.; Hatjina, Fani; Mossialos, Dimitris",Antibiotics (Basel),95,1

It is unknown how these behavioral shifts may differ by sociodemographic characteristics and whether shifts may widen or diminish existing diet-related disparities. To fill these gaps, we use nationally-representative Consumer Panel survey data to examine shifts in online grocery shopping by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: The Nielsen COVID-19 Shopper Behavior Survey was administered to a subset of Nielsen Homescan panel participants in March-April 2020 (n = 17,262 households (HH)). We describe survey-weighted HH sociodemographic characteristics and reasons for online shopping. Survey weighted-multivariable logistic regression was used to examine sociodemographic correlates of reported increases in online food shopping. RESULTS: One third (34%) of our survey-weighted sample said they shopped for groceries online more since COVID-19, and 60% of these HH reported planning to continue shopping online after COVID-19. In adjusted analyses, all age groups (40–54 y, 55–64y, 65 + y) had lower odds of online shopping than heads of HH 39 years or younger (all OR = 0.7, P < 0.001). Lower educated (high school or less) HH had lower odds of online shopping compared to higher educated (college or more) HH (OR = 0.7, P < 0.001). HH in the South had higher odds of online shopping than those in the Northeast (OR = 1.2, P = 0.006). Compared to Non-Hispanic (NH) white HH, Hispanic HH had higher odds of online shopping (OR = 1.2, P = 0.02), and NH Asian HH had lower odds of online shopping (OR = 0.8, P = 0.02). HH with children had higher odds of online shopping compared to households without children (OR = 1.4, P < 0.001). Of those who said they would increase the amount of online shopping they did for everyday items including food (37%), the top reasons were to avoid public germs and COVID-19 (81%), to take advantage of the convenience (44%) and to access a better selection (17%). CONCLUSIONS: There are disparities in shifts in online shopping behaviors due to COVID-19. Understanding these disparities can inform public health nutrition interventions related to online food shopping. We will assess the August 2020 survey as the pandemic may further change food shopping habits.

International studies report a high prevalence of back pain, especially in the last trimester. Little is known about the prevalence of back pain in South African pregnant women. AIM: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of back pain in a cohort of pregnant women SETTING: Public primary healthcare clinics and the eThekwini municipality of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa METHODS: A descriptive cohort design was used to survey pregnant women (n = 303) over the course of their pregnancy. Data were collected at the first antenatal visit and again in the third trimester. Participants gave consent and ethical clearance was obtained from an institutional research ethics committee, from the eThekwini Health District and KZN Provincial Department of Health. RESULTS: The respondents were young Black African women (mean age of 25.8 (± 6.0), who were mostly unemployed (70.7%), and resided in a resource poor setting. Back pain prevalence at the first antenatal visit and the third trimester was 12.4% (n = 35) and 10.9% (n = 5), respectively. This condition was associated with carrying water and residing in a hostel or an employee’s property. Being single was associated with less risk for developing back pain. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of back pain was low in this cohort of women, yet it resulted in a negative impact on the women’s ability to cope with daily life.

The system has improved to provide a path for the development of online entrepreneurship where individuals can become founders of online businesses or manage internet-based businesses. There are many research studies from different contexts to understand the importance of E-Entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, not until recently, E-Entrepreneurship business impact and opportunities were not being seriously discussed. Furthermore, the complexity and dynamic flow-process towards adopting E-Entrepreneurship were also ignored. As a result, this study is aimed at examining the adoption of E-Entrepreneurship among Saudi Arabians. Four main variables were conceptualized, “E-entrepreneurship behavioral intention (EBI)”, “perceived usefulness (PU)”, “social pressure (SP)”, and “online transactions (OT)”. Quantitative surveys were utilized to test the proposed hypothesis. Furthermore, DEMATEL evaluation analysis was used to find the most important criteria of E-Entrepreneur adoption. The samples of the study are obtained from Saudis. Analysis of the results revealed that all the hypotheses are positively significant and supported. This indicates the influences of all the variables on E-Entrepreneurship Behavioral Intention. DEMATEL results are also consistent with the survey finding. It indicates that “social pressure” in E-Entrepreneurship adoption is the key criteria. The study reveals the important factors that affect E-Entrepreneurship acceptance in Saudi Arabia. The finding of the study significantly implicates E-Entrepreneurship service providers and e-marketers to develop a more complete understanding of the factors that affect the Individual intention to accept E-Entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia.

Sepsis has a high mortality rate, with most patients dying due to systemic organ failure or secondary infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells. Upon infection with microbes, DCs are activated to induce adaptive immune responses for controlling infection. DC generation and function are impaired during sepsis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from sepsis patients were collected to examine DC subsets, DC progenitors, and apoptosis of DCs by flow cytometer. In vitro induction of DCs from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were established and a variety of sepsis-associated inflammatory mediators [e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)] and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined for the impact on DC generation and function in vitro. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that sepsis-induced systemic inflammation impairs the capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to produce DCs, including conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). We investigated peripheral blood (PB) samples from 34 pediatric patients on days 1 to 7 following diagnosis. Compared to healthy donors (n = 18), the sepsis patients exhibited a significantly fewer percentage and number of pDCs and cDCs, and a lower expression of antigen presenting molecule HLD-DR and co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD86) on the surface of DCs. This sepsis-induced DC impairment was associated with significantly increased apoptotic death of DCs and marked decreases of progenitor cells that give rise to DCs. Furthermore, we observed that among the tested sepsis-associated cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, and G-CSF), G-CSF and IFN-γ impaired DC development from cultured HSPCs. G-CSF also markedly decreased the expression of HLA-DR on HSPC-derived DCs and their cytokine production, including IL-12 and IFN-β. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings indicate that sepsis impairs the survival of functional DCs and their development from HSPCs. Strategies for improving DC reconstitution following sepsis may restore DC progenitors and their associated function.","Lu, Jie; Sun, Kun; Yang, Huiping; Fan, Dan; Huang, He; Hong, Yi; Wu, Shuiyan; Zhou, HuiTing; Fang, Fang; Li, YanHong; Meng, Lijun; Huang, Jie; Bai, Zhenjiang",Front Immunol,95,1

In cases of prolonged treatment, glucocorticoids promote the loss and inactivation of the differentiational function of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), risking the development of skeletal system diseases such as osteoporosis. This study reports for the first time the protective effect of the antimalarial artemisinin against glucocorticoid-induced insults on primary cultured rat BMSCs. At relatively low concentrations, artemisinin treatment improved BMSC survival by promoting a decline of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that correlated with the decrease of caspase-3 activation, LDH release, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, and apoptosis induced by dexamethasone (DEXA). In addition, artemisinin improved the osteogenic differentiation of DEXA-damaged cells. DEXA inhibited extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, and artemisinin treatment promoted their activation in a concentration-dependent manner. PD98059, the specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2 pathway, blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation and artemisinin protection. Similarly, siCREB attenuated the protective effect of artemisinin, strongly suggesting the involvement of the ERK1/2-CREB pathway in the protective action of artemisinin against DEXA-induced damage in BMSCs. In addition, we found that the expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL-2) was also upregulated by artemisinin. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of artemisinin in the survival improvement of BMSCs exposed to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and suggest that artemisinin-mediated protection may occur via the activation of ERK1/2-CREB signaling pathway.","Fang, Jiankang; Silva, Marta; Lin, Ruohong; Zhou, Wenshu; Chen, Yitan; Zheng, Wenhua",Oxid Med Cell Longev,95,13

A considerable proportion of disabilities results from perinatal adversities. The neonatal and infant mortality rates in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have improved over the last two decades, implying survival of infants at risk for developmental impairments. The need to thrive beyond survival is a well-recognized concept and it is imperative to establish high-risk infant follow-up (HRIF) programmes to capture these infants within the first 1000 d of life. Many challenges are present within the LMICs to identify infants at risk and to ensure early intervention (EI) during the window of optimal neural plasticity. However, it is essential to acknowledge the strengths within such systems to understand the impact of these programmes and packages on the activity and participation of these infants and their families. The International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) version is a holistic framework that will enable the families, clinicians, and policymakers to measure the impact of these interventions. Though all three countries have national policies to reach for high-risk infants, there is lack of published evidence on the successful implementation of such strategies. Therefore, it is timely to establish universally accessible, culturally appropriate and sustainable HRIF programmes. It is also recommended to measure the outcomes of such programmes based on the ICF-CY to understand the impact on the activity and participation of children in South Asia.","Vipulaguna, Dilini; Jahan, Ismat; Girish, Meenakshi; Chinnappa, Gayathri Devi; Gopalaswamy, Shashikala; Shahidullah, Mohammod; Sumanasena, Samanmali P",Indian journal of pediatrics,95,17

We aimed to assess the characteristics of HA-CDI acquired during and before the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital, in which since March 2020 exclusively COVID-19 patients are hospitalized. We compared HA-CDI adult patients hospitalized in March 2020-February 2021 with those hospitalized during the same period in 2017-2018.Results We found 51 cases during 2020-2021 (COVID-19 group), incidence 5.6/1000 adult discharge and 99 cases during 2017-2018 (pre-COVID-19 group), incidence 6.1/1000 adult discharge (p=0.6). The patients in COVID-19 group compared to pre-COVID-19 group were older (median age 66 vs 62 years), with similar rate of comorbidities, but with higher rate of cardiovascular diseases (62.7% vs 42.4%) and less immunosuppression (21.6% vs 55.6%), they had a higher proton pump inhibitors use (94.1% vs 32.3%), and a longer hospitalization (median 19 vs 14 days).Eighty-five (85.9%) patients in pre-COVID-19 group versus 44 (86.3%) patients in COVID-19 group received antimicrobial treatment - mainly cephalosporins (34,1%), quinolones (22,3%) and glycopeptides (21,1%) in pre-COVID-19 group and mainly cephalosporins and macrolides (63,6% each) in COVID-19 group.

It was thus essential to define priority groups for vaccination by the Brazilian National Immunization Program (PNI in Portuguese), based on the risk of hospitalization and death from the disease. We calculated overrisk according to sex, age group, and comorbidities using hospitalization and death records from severe acute respiratory illness with confirmation of COVID-19 (SARI-COVID) in all of Brazil in the first 6 months of the epidemic. Higher overrisk was associated with male sex (hospitalization = 1.1 and death = 1.2), age over 45 years for hospitalization (OvRag ranging from 1.1 to 8.5), and age over 55 year for death (OvRag ranging from 1.5 to 18.3). In the groups with comorbidities, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease were associated with overrisk, while there was no such evidence for asthma. Chronic kidney disease or diabetes and age over 60 showed an even stronger association, reaching overrisk of death 14 and 10 times greater than in the general population, respectively. For all the comorbidities, there was higher overrisk at older ages, with a downward gradient in the oldest age groups. This pattern was reversed when examining overrisk in the general population, for both hospitalization and death. The current study provided evidence of overrisk of hospitalization and death from SARI-COVID, assisting the definition of priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination.","Lana, Raquel Martins; Freitas, Laís Picinini; Codeço, Cláudia Torres; Pacheco, Antônio Guilherme; Carvalho, Luiz Max Fagundes de; Villela, Daniel Antunes Maciel; Coelho, Flávio Codeço; Cruz, Oswaldo Gonçalves; Niquini, Roberta Pereira; Porto, Victor Bertollo Gomes; Gava, Caroline; Gomes, Marcelo Ferreira da Costa; Bastos, Leonardo Soares",Cadernos de saude publica,95,23

Pulmonary infection secondary to sepsis caused by CRKP has been reported only rarely in kidney transplant recipients. Here we report an interesting and complicated case in which CRKP was initially isolated in a culture of renal graft preservation solution, yet was not detected in the daily cultures from collection of surgical drainage. Prophylactic tigecycline was terminated at post-transplantation day 10 because of the occurrence of acute pancreatitis. Five days later, the patient suddenly developed a multisite infection with CRKP involving the bloodstream, urinary tract, and lungs, indicating probable transmission from the donor. Fortunately, the infection was controlled quickly and effectively with a combination therapy consisting of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and carbapenem, which was suggested by the results of disc diffusion susceptibility testing. However, the CRKP infection reappeared in the bloodstream and urinary tract soon after the treatment of acute rejection. The combination regimen was continued for another 15 days, and the patient ultimately recovered. During the following 15 months of observation, the patient's renal graft function remained stable, without recurrence of the CRKP infection. In conclusion, the combined use of CZA and carbapenem was safe and produced an optimal therapeutic effect on the severe multisite infection caused by CRKP in a renal transplant recipient, thus providing a reference case for treating such patients.","Wang, Zhiqiang; Ma, Ke; Chen, Zhongju; Guo, Zhiliang; Zhao, Guangyuan; Guo, Hui; Zhu, Lan; Chen, Gang",Transplantation proceedings,95,16

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent causative pathogen of CABP. Other common pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacteriaceae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. However, in clinical practice, the causative pathogen of CABP is most often not identified. Therefore, a common treatment approach for patients hospitalized with CABP is empiric antibiotic therapy with a β-lactam in combination with a macrolide, respiratory fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines. An increase in the incidence of S. pneumoniae that is resistant to frequently used antibiotics, including β-lactams, macrolides, and tetracyclines, provides a challenge for the physician when selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy. When patients with CABP do not respond to initial therapy, they must be adequately reevaluated with further diagnostic testing, change in antimicrobial regimen, and/or transfer of the patient to a higher level of care. The role of hospital medicine physicians is crucial in treating patients who are hospitalized with CABP. An important focus of hospitalists is to provide care improvement in a way that addresses both patient and hospital needs. It is essential that the hospitalist provides best possible patient care, including adherence to quality measures, optimizing the patient's hospital length of stay, and arranging adequate post-discharge care in an effort to prevent readmission and provide appropriate ongoing outpatient care.","Amin, Alpesh N; Cerceo, Elizabeth A; Deitelzweig, Steven B; Pile, James C; Rosenberg, David J; Sherman, Bradley M",Postgraduate medicine,95,16

METHODS We analyzed data from STAR*D subjects who self identified as White, Black, or Latino. Rates of isolated psychotic symptoms were assessed by the self-rated Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ) and compared between ethnic-racial groups. Depressive remission outcomes were compared within each ethnic-racial group between subjects who endorsed psychotic symptoms versus no psychotic symptoms. Associations between isolated psychotic symptoms and anxiety disorders were also examined. RESULTS Among 2597 eligible subjects with at least one post-baseline assessment and available PDSQ data excluding first-rank symptoms, the prevalence of auditory-visual hallucination was 2.5% in Whites (n=49/1928), 11.3% in Blacks (n=45/398) 6.3% in Latinos (n=17/270) (χ(2)=64.9; df=2; p<0.001). Prevalence of paranoid ideation was 15.5% in Whites (n=299/1927), 31.5% in Blacks (n=126/400), and 21.1% in Latinos (n=57/270) (χ(2)=57.3; df=2; p<0.001). Among Whites and Blacks but not Latinos, depressive remission rates were worse in subjects with auditory-visual hallucinations compared to those without them. Paranoid ideation had a significant negative impact on remission in Whites only. In all ethnic-racial groups, a significant association was found between auditory-visual hallucinations and PTSD and panic disorder. LIMITATIONS The STAR*D study did not include any structured clinician-based assessment of psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSION Latinos do not appear to have worse outcomes when treated for MDD with auditory-visual hallucinations, differently from Whites and Blacks.","Cassano, Paolo; Chang, Trina; Trinh, Nhi-Ha; Baer, Lee; Fava, Maurizio; Mischoulon, David",Journal of affective disorders,95,31

A modelling and simulation framework is provided using SARS-CoV-2 as an example, considering applications of both treatment and prophylaxis. METHODS A target cell-limited model was used to quantify the viral infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a pooled population of 105 infected patients. Parameter estimates from the resulting model were used to simulate and compare the impact of various interventions against meaningful viral load endpoints. RESULTS Robust parameter estimates were obtained for the basic reproduction number, viral release rate and infected-cell mortality from the infection model. These estimates were informed by the largest dataset currently available for SARS-CoV-2 viral time course. The utility of this model was demonstrated using simulations, which hypothetically introduced inhibitory or stimulatory drug mechanisms at various target sites within the viral life-cycle. We show that early intervention is crucial to achieving therapeutic benefit when monotherapy is administered. In contrast, combination regimens of two or three drugs may provide improved outcomes if treatment is initiated late. The latter is relevant to SARS-CoV-2, where the period between infection and symptom onset is relatively long. CONCLUSIONS The use of in silico models can provide viral load predictions that can rationalize therapeutic strategies against an emerging viral pathogen.","Patel, Kashyap; Dodds, Michael; Gonçalves, Antonio; Kamal, Mohamed A; Rayner, Craig R; Kirkpatrick, Carl M; Smith, Patrick F",British journal of clinical pharmacology,95,19

In this article, we report the fabrication of the first tissue-engineered heart valve (TEHV) based on a tubular leaflet design, where the function of the leaflets of semilunar heart valves is performed by a simple tubular construct sutured along a circumferential line at the root and at three single points at the sinotubular junction. The tubular design is a recent development in pericardial (nonviable) bioprostheses, which has attracted interest because of the simplicity of the construction and the reliability of the implantation technique. Here we push the potential of the concept further from the fabrication and material point of view to realize the tube-in-tube valve: an autologous, living HV with remodelling and growing capability, physiological haemocompatibility, simple to construct and fast to implant. We developed two different fabrication/conditioning procedures and produced fibrin-based constructs embedding cells from the ovine umbilical cord artery according to the two different approaches. Tissue formation was confirmed by histology and immunohistology. The design of the tube-in-tube foresees the possibility of using a textile coscaffold (here demonstrated with a warp-knitted mesh) to achieve enhanced mechanical properties in vision of implantation in the aortic position. The tube-in-tube represents an attractive alternative to the conventional design of TEHVs aiming at reproducing the valvular geometry.","Weber, Miriam; Heta, Eriona; Moreira, Ricardo; Gesche, Valentine N; Schermer, Thomas; Frese, Julia; Jockenhoevel, Stefan; Mela, Petra","Tissue engineering.

The importance of bats as natural hosts for several important viral zoonoses, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, and rabies viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been established; however, the large viral population diversity (virome) of bats has been partially determined for only a few of the ∼1,200 bat species. To assess the virome of North American bats, we collected fecal, oral, urine, and tissue samples from individual bats captured at an abandoned railroad tunnel in Maryland that is cohabitated by 7 to 10 different bat species. Here, we present preliminary characterization of the virome of three common North American bat species, including big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). In samples derived from these bats, we identified viral sequences that were similar to at least three novel group 1 CoVs, large numbers of insect and plant virus sequences, and nearly full-length genomic sequences of two novel bacteriophages. These observations suggest that bats encounter and disseminate a large assortment of viruses capable of infecting many different animals, insects, and plants in nature.","Donaldson, Eric F; Haskew, Aimee N; Gates, J Edward; Huynh, Jeremy; Moore, Clea J; Frieman, Matthew B",Journal of virology,95,24

While majority of the previous systematic reviews have focused on the effectiveness of mHealth apps in improving treatment outcomes in patients with T2DM, there is a need to also understand how mHealth apps influence self-management of T2DM. This is crucial to ensure improvement in the design and use of mHealth apps for T2DM. This protocol describes how a systematic review will be conducted to determine in which way(s) mHealth apps might impact on self-management of T2DM. METHODS The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to April 2019: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Health Management Information Consortium database, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measures to be assessed will be 'change in blood glucose'. The secondary outcomes measures will be 'changes in cardiovascular risk markers' (including blood pressure, body mass index and blood lipids), and self-management practices. Others will include: health-related quality of life, economic data, social support, harms (eg, death or complications leading to hospital admissions or emergency unit attendances), death from any cause, anxiety or depression and adverse events (eg, hypoglycaemic episodes).

As the experience with lung transplantation accrues, it has become increasingly apparent that not all chronic allograft dysfunction is consistent with the traditionally recognized small-airway histological process of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). OBJECTIVES To identify and describe chronic allograft dysfunction that is not consistent with the well-described bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and to further characterize a novel histopathological process, acute fibrinoid organizing pneumonia (AFOP), that has led invariably to respiratory decline and death after lung transplantation. METHODS We evaluated 194 bilateral lung transplant recipients, identifying 87 individuals who developed chronic allograft dysfunction. They were then classified according to features on spirometry, chest imaging, and histopathological specimens. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Two main phenotypes of chronic allograft dysfunction were identified; 39 (45%) recipients were categorized as having developed OB and 22 (25%) as having AFOP. Survival in those who developed AFOP was significantly worse than in those who developed OB (median time to death 101 vs. 294 d; P = 0.02), with all exhibiting a rapid decline in respiratory function leading to death. CONCLUSIONS AFOP is a novel form of chronic allograft dysfunction exhibiting spirometric, radiological, and histopathological characteristics that differentiate it from OB. The further characterization of chronic allograft dysfunction and its heterogeneous manifestations will allow the targeting of clinical and experimental efforts to prevent and treat chronic allograft dysfunction.","Paraskeva, Miranda; McLean, Catriona; Ellis, Samantha; Bailey, Michael; Williams, Trevor; Levvey, Bronwyn; Snell, Gregory I; Westall, Glen P",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,95,1

In this study, we investigated the value of non-diabetic glycosuria as a diagnostic clue for ATIN. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adult patients who underwent a kidney biopsy as an evaluation for serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL. Patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range, diabetes mellitus, or transplanted kidney were excluded. The laboratory abnormalities suggestive of tubular injury were compared between 28 patients (14 men and 14 women, mean age 48.5 ± 14.1 years) with ATIN and 116 patients (76 men and 40 women, mean age 53.1 ± 15.0 years) with other diagnoses. RESULTS In ATIN, glycosuria (≥ 1+ on dipstick; 68%) was more frequent than hypophosphatemia (18%), hypouricemia (18%), hypokalemia (18%), and tubular proteinuria (40%). In other diagnoses, glycosuria (≥ 1+) was detected in 7 (6%) patients; 6 of them had the histological diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis. The presence of glycosuria (≥ 1+) had 68% sensitivity and 94% specificity for ATIN, with the positive likelihood ratio of 11.24 and the negative likelihood ratio of 0.34. Pyuria and low total CO2 were equally and more sensitive (68% and 71%, respectively) than glycosuria (≥ 1+), but had no diagnostic value due to low specificities (58% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION In non-diabetic, non-nephrotic patients undergoing a kidney biopsy for azotemia, 1+ or higher glycosuria, if present, was a good predictor of the diagnosis of ATIN.","Lee, Taeyeon; Yang, Won Seok",Renal failure,95,13

PURPOSE To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment or prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DATA SOURCES PubMed (via MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, Preprints, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry from 1 December 2019 until 8 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies in any language reporting efficacy or safety outcomes from hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use in any setting in adults or children with suspected COVID-19 or at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DATA EXTRACTION Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. DATA SYNTHESIS Four randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 9 case series assessed treatment effects of the medications, but no studies evaluated prophylaxis. Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing. Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies. Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation. An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate 500 mg once or twice daily with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine. LIMITATION There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies. CONCLUSION Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a common approach to help restore muscle strength. Traditional NMES directly over the muscle often leads to a rapid onset of muscle fatigue. In this study, we investigated the force sustainability of finger flexor muscles using a transcutaneous nerve stimulation approach. APPROACH Finger flexion forces and high-density electromyogram (HD EMG) signals were obtained while electrical stimulation was applied to the ulnar and median nerve bundles through a stimulation grid on the proximal arm segment. Stimulation was also applied to the finger flexor muscle belly targeting the motor point, serving as a control condition. The force produced from the two stimulation approaches were initially matched, and muscle fatigue was subsequently induced with 5 min of continuous stimulation. The rate of decay of the force and EMG amplitude were quantified, and the spatial distribution of the muscle activation during the sustained contraction was also evaluated. MAIN RESULTS The proximal nerve stimulation approach induced a slower decay in both force and EMG, compared with the stimulation at the motor point. The spatial distribution of the elicited muscle activation showed that the proximal nerve stimulation led to a distributed activation across the intrinsic and extrinsic finger flexor muscles and also activated a wider area within the extrinsic muscle. SIGNIFICANCE Our findings demonstrated that the stimulation of the proximal nerve bundles can elicit sustained force output and delayed decrease in the rate of force decline. This is potentially due to a spatially distributed activation of the muscle fibers, compared with the traditional motor point stimulation. Future development of our nerve stimulation approach may enable prolonged usage during rehabilitation or assistance for better functional outcomes.","Shin, Henry; Chen, Ryan; Hu, Xiaogang",Journal of neural engineering,95,1

Under an IRB-approved prospective registry that we started in July 2013, we have been using endoluminal vacuum therapy to treat a variety of leaks throughout the GI tract. The procedure uses an endosponge connected to a nasogastric tube that is endoscopically guided into a fistula cavity in order to facilitate healing, obtain source control, and aid in reperfusion of the adjacent tissue with debridement.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, in contrast, respond to infection with production of high levels of IFNs. Here, we show that pretreatment of non-lymphatic cells with small amounts of IFN-alpha (IFN priming) partially overturns the block in IFN induction imposed by SARS-CoV. IFN priming combined with SARS-CoV infection substantially induced genes for IFN induction, IFN signalling, antiviral effector proteins, ubiquitination and ISGylation, antigen presentation and other cytokines and chemokines, whereas each individual treatment had no major effect. Curiously, however, despite this typical IFN response, neither IRF-3 nor IRF-7 was transported to the nucleus as a sign of activation. Taken together, our results suggest that (i) IFN, as it is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, could enable tissue cells to launch a host response to SARS-CoV, (ii) IRF-3 and IRF-7 may be active at subdetectable levels, and (iii) SARS-CoV does not activate IRF-7.","Kuri, Thomas; Zhang, Xiaonan; Habjan, Matthias; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Yuan, Zhenghong; Weber, Friedemann",The Journal of general virology,95,2

We used CTP to study these patients during or briefly after resolution of their amnesic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2002 onward, patients satisfying clinical criteria for transient global amnesia who underwent CTP were included. Patients with additional clinical features suggesting transient ischemic attack or stroke and those with an ischemic lesion on subsequent DWI were excluded. If deemed necessary by the clinician, DWI was performed within 10 days. RESULTS Thirty patients with transient global amnesia underwent CTP at a median latency of 5.9 hours (interquartile range, 4.3-9.7 hours) after symptom onset. All findings, except for those in 1 patient, were normal, including those in the 14 patients with well-imaged hippocampi. In the patient with abnormal findings, CTP and PWI showed hypoperfusion in both lentiform nuclei extending into the insulae, with normalization on the repeat CTP 6 days later. In 10 patients, DWI was performed at a median latency of 2 days (interquartile range, 0-9 days). Of these, 2 showed punctate hippocampal lesions, often seen in transient global amnesia. In 2 patients excluded because of mildly atypical transient global amnesia and ischemic lesions on subsequent DWI, acute CTP findings were also normal. CONCLUSIONS Patients with transient global amnesia had normal CTP findings in the acute phase with the exception of 1 patient with transient hypoperfusion in both basal ganglia. If imaging is performed for typical and atypical transient global amnesia, DWI should be the preferred method.","Meyer, I A; Wintermark, M; Démonet, J-F; Michel, P",AJNR.

Despite this, undergraduate medical education is often limited in its approach to inclusion health curricula, leaving students disengaged and lacking understanding. METHODS We conducted two research studies to explore medical students' experiences of inclusion health education. All participants were studying medicine at the University of Leeds at the time of data collection. We gathered experiences of both compulsory and elective inclusion health education via semi-structured interviews. Interview responses were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. FINDINGS We identified several key findings across the two studies. Firstly, medical students felt unprepared to work with inclusion health groups. Further to this, medical students have a preference for interactive teaching and learning in inclusion health education. Finally, encountering inclusion health groups by chance (on placement) or choice (optional initiatives) present different opportunities. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our research suggests that simply being exposed to inclusion health groups through lectures and on placement is not considered sufficient by medical students, and in fact can lead to the perpetuation of misinformation and stigma. Participants perceived that optional initiatives or 'choice encounters' had profoundly positive impacts on attitudes and interest, particularly when there were opportunities to learn directly from individuals with lived experience of exclusion. We suggest that a flipped classroom approach to inclusion health education along with integrated experiential learning would provide medical students with comprehensive and patient-focused learning opportunities.","Dixon, Hannah; Povall, Anna; Ledger, Alison; Ashwell, Gemma",The clinical teacher,95,31

COVID-19 pandemic obliged many countries to impose social restrictions, resulting in the need to adapt daily lifestyle habits and working activities. These changes have drastically reduced physical activity and social interactions, with the possible increase of anxiety, eating disorders and weight gain. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We searched for relevant studies (trials, real-life studies and case reports, meta-analysis, pooled data analysis, reviews) on endocrine disorders and inflammatory skin diseases. The database used was PubMed. The studies included were those published in the English language between January 1, 2018 and May 5, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Several studies have been previously showed the association of overweight and obesity, with the metabolic syndrome and insulin-resistance. It has been demonstrated how these conditions correlate with the worsening of such chronic inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and acne. Many evidences suggest an important role of adipose tissue in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Leptin, adiponectin, TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, PAI-1), involved in the pathogenesis and the exacerbations of these skin diseases. In addition, we should expect an increasing incidence rate of hypovitaminosis D in the next future due to reduced sun exposure caused by isolation at home and missed holidays. Scientific evidences already show the important immunomodulating role of vitamin D in inflammatory skin diseases. CONCLUSIONS Our study pays attention on medium-long term effects of COVID-19 outbreak on inflammatory skin disorders, due to the lifestyle changes. In such context this review considers how a multidisciplinary approach, involving dermatologists, nutritionists and endocrinologists, may lead to a better management of dermatologic patients.","Marasca, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Barrea, Luigi; Capasso, Gianmarco; Di Guida, Adriana; Cinelli, Eleonora; Fontanella, Giuseppina",Minerva endocrinologica,95,4

Since 2019-nCoV is a newly emerging virus, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not well known. Most patients had a self-limited course, and some became severe even death. In this review, the authors compared two coronavirus outbreaks during the past two decades: the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Among the biological nature of the pathogens, viral receptor distribution on the human cells, and the pathological findings in the targeted organs and clinical features of the patients with the diseases, found similarities and differences between the two diseases. Due to the shared receptor ACE2 and the pathological similarities of the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV diseases. They proposed a pathogenesis model for COVID-19. Like the SARS-CoV disease, COVID-19 is a systematic disease and targets the lungs, vasculatures, and the immune system. The basic pathogenesis involves two interlinked processes: a severe lung inflammation and immune deficiency, both of which are related to an inappropriate immune response and over-production of cytokines. Thus, treatment approaches should include antiviral and anti-proinflammatory cytokines, anti-infectious and life support therapies, especially in patients with severe diseases.","Wang, X; Ding, Y Q",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,95,1

The pathophysiology of the infection is associated with an increased inflammatory reaction which may lead to lung tissue damage and other disorders, affecting also the cardiovascular system. The clinical manifestations of the infection differ and depend mainly on the age and comorbidities. Cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor clinical course of the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 is higher in patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. A significant challenge for the health care system during the ongoing pandemic is not only the treatment of COVID-19 patients and limitation of the spread of the infection, but also provision of proper care to all other patients. The latter is difficult due to the necessity of redistributing resources, limiting access to medical care and patients' fear of becoming infected, as a result of which they delay seeking medical help and avoid contacting medical services despite intensifying symptoms. Those factors determine a different profile of patients admitted to the hospital in acute cardiac conditions and also the modification of standard procedures, especially in relation to acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and pulmonary embolism. The crucial issue is to provide the optimal treatment and at the same time effectively protect the personnel and other patients against infection of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge how to provide safe and efficient help in cardiac emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sokolski, Mateusz; Sokolska, Justyna Maria; Zymliński, Robert; Biegus, Jan; Banasiak, Waldemar; Reczuch, Krzysztof; Ponikowski, Piotr",Kardiologia polska,95,15

Participants (N = 177) were semi-randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a Stress-intervention condition, a Stress-placebo condition, and a No-stress-placebo control condition. Participants viewed four images of complex, mildly negatively valenced scenes. One day later, they received an arousal reappraisal intervention or placebo before exposure to a laboratory stressor (or a control version for the No-stress condition). Participants were then tested on their memory of the images using a free recall instruction and multiple-choice recognition questions. As expected, negative affect and blood pressure increased for the stress conditions but not the control condition. Contrary to our hypotheses, memory performance did not statistically significant differ between the Stress-placebo condition and the No-stress-placebo control condition, indicating a lack of negative effects of acute retrieval stress on memory. Furthermore, we also found no statistically significant differences between the Stress-intervention condition and Stress-placebo condition in terms of memory performance, suggesting that the intervention did not assist with enhancing memory.

OBJECTIVE To report multicenter experience with flow diversion exclusively for BBA, located at non-branching segments along the anteromedial wall of the supraclinoidal internal carotid artery (ICA). METHODS Consecutive cases of BBA located at non-branching segments along the anteromedial wall of the supraclinoidal ICA treated with flow diversion were included in the final analysis. RESULTS 49 patients with 51 BBA of the ICA treated with devices to achieve the flow diversion effect were identified. 43 patients with 45 BBA of the ICA were treated with the pipeline embolization device and were included in the final analysis. Angiographic follow-up data were available for 30 patients (32 aneurysms in total); 87.5% of aneurysms (28/32) showed complete obliteration, 9.4% (3/32) showed reduced filling, and 3.1% (1/32) persistent filling. There was no difference between the size of aneurysm (≤2 mm vs >2 mm) or the use of adjunct coiling and complete occlusion of the aneurysm on follow-up (P=0.354 and P=0.865, respectively).

However, despite the ongoing treatment, the consequences of this disease are possible, which may appear in the short term or after a while. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is characterized by the presence of such complications as cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite disorders, etc. Often, pneumonia leads to dysfunctions of the respiratory system, higher mental functions, functions of the cardiovascular system and, unfortunately, possible disability. The search and implementation of new methods of physical rehabilitation is an urgent task of modern medicine. Low-frequency magnetotherapy is one of the safest and most commonly recommended treatments for pneumonia. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of the use of low-frequency magnetotherapy in the complex medical rehabilitation of patients who have had pneumonia in the phase of convalescence. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 52 patients who had suffered from pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and whose average age was 56.2±5.7 years. Group I (main) group (n=30), against the background of standard therapy on the 16th day after discharge from the hospital, received low-frequency magnetotherapy on the ALMAG-02 apparatus (Elamed, Russia) daily for 20 minutes, a course of 10-12 procedures. In the second (control) group (n=22), therapy was carried out in accordance with the Temporary Clinical Recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection COVID-19 (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020), as well as the Temporary Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation for a new coronavirus infection (version 8.1 of 01/10/2020). Evaluation method: spirometry using a spirographMIR (Italy), chest excursion, rehabilitation routing scale (RRM), quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D), Borg scale for patient assessment of exercise tolerance, ECG, oxygen saturation in the blood. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The patients of the 1st group showed an increase in the vital capacity of the lungs by 16.4% in comparison with the 2nd (control) group; an increase in chest excursion by 45.6%, a decrease in the level of shortness of breath from moderate to mild by 64.1%, a decrease in disabilities by 62.7%, compared with the second (control) group. According to the data of the quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D), the patients of the main group showed improvements in general mobility (mobility) by 44.5%, everyday activity by 26.1%, a decrease in pain/discomfort by 47.9%, anxiety and depression by 42.2%, compared with the control group (p=0.001).

However, U-Net applies skip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level convolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also over- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully convolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and multi-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of the encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less dissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network layers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or matches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters. Furthermore, Sharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of learnable parameters.","Zunair, Hasib; Ben Hamza, A",Computers in biology and medicine,95,1

In this study, we validated and further refined formulas for estimating partial pressure of carbon dioxide with respiratory gas and pulse oximetry data in mechanically ventilated cardiac arrest patients. METHODS A total of 4,741 data sets were collected retrospectively from 233 resuscitated patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. The original formula used to analyze the data is PaCO2 -est1= PETCO2 +k[(PIO2 -PETCO2 ) -PaO2 ]. To achieve better accuracy, we further modified the formula to PaCO2 -est2= k1 *PETCO2 + k2 *(PIO2 -PETCO2 )+k3 *(100-SpO2 ). The coefficients were determined by identifying the minimal difference between the measured and calculated arterial carbon dioxide values in a development set. The accuracy of these two methods was compared with the estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide using end-tidal carbon dioxide. RESULTS With PaCO2 -est1, the mean difference between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the estimated carbon dioxide was 0.08 kPa (SE ± 0.003); with PaCO2 -est2 the difference was 0.036 kPa (SE ± 0.009). The mean difference between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and end-tidal carbon dioxide was 0.72 kPa (SE ± 0.01). In a mixed linear model, there was a significant difference between the estimation using end-tidal carbon dioxide and PaCO2 -est1 (p<0.001) and PaCO2 -est2 (p<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS This novel formula appears to provide an accurate, continuous, and noninvasive estimation of arterial carbon dioxide.","Rentola, R; Skrifvars, M B; Heinonen, E; Häggblom, T; Hästbackax, J",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,95,1

In this context, this review summarizes the various wastewater treatment technologies which have been studied with a focus of bioaerosols emissions, potential emission stages, available sampling strategies, survival and dispersion factors, dominant microbial species in bioaerosols, and possible control approaches. Literature review revealed that most of the studies were devoted to sampling, enumerating and identifying cultivable microbial species of bioaerosols, as well as measuring their concentrations. However, the role of treatment technologies and their operational factors are investigated in limited studies only. Moreover, few studies have been reported to investigate the presence and concentrations of air borne virus and fungi in WWTP, as compared to bacterial species. The common environmental factors, affecting the survival and dispersion of bioaerosols, are observed as relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination. Further, research studies on recent episodes of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic also revealed that continuous and effective surveillance on WWTPs associated bioaerosols may led to early sign for future pandemics. The evaluation of reported data is bit complicated, due to the variation in sampling approaches, ambient conditions, and site activities of each study. Therefore, such studies need a standardized methodology and improved guidance to help informed future policies, contextual research, and support a robust health-based risk assessment process.

Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that the use of these surgical devices for thyroidectomy compared with conventional thyroidectomy (clamp-and-tie) techniques reduces operative time and cost. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine if there is any difference in operative time and cost between B and UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral center. A total of 90 patients who required a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, thyroid nodules, or hyperthyroidism were randomized to either B or UC during thyroidectomy. The operative time and cost of thyroidectomy were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference in patient age, gender, body mass index, indication for thyroidectomy and thyroid gland weight between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in operating room cost or total cost for thyroidectomy between the B and UC groups. There was also no statistically significant difference in the operative time between the B and UC groups (187.6 vs. 184.2 min, P = 0.48) or in postoperative complication rates. The only statistically significant difference in total cost was between surgeons independent of the device used (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In thyroid surgery, total cost and operative time were similar between the two surgical devices used.","Rahbari, Reza; Mathur, Aarti; Kitano, Mio; Guerrero, Marlon; Shen, Wen T; Duh, Quan-Yang; Clark, Orlo H; Kebebew, Electron",Annals of surgical oncology,95,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-three extracted mandibular first molars, with two separate mesial canals in each, were selected. After instrumentation, the canals were stratified into three groups based on canal length and curvature, and underwent obturation with one of the techniques. No sealer was used in order to avoid masking any voids. The teeth were imaged pre- and post-obturation using micro-computed tomography. The reconstructed three-dimensional images were analyzed volumetrically to determine the amount of gutta-percha present in every 2 mm segment of the canal. P values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS The overall mean volume fraction of gutta-percha was 68.51 ± 6.75% for CL, 86.56 ± 5.00% for UL, and 88.91 ± 5.16% for WV. Significant differences were found between CL and UL and between CL and WV (p < 0.05), but not between UL and WV (p = 0.526). The gutta-percha density of the roots treated with WV and UL increased towards the coronal aspect, but this trend was not noted in the CL group.

On the other hand, acute respiratory infections especially of viral origin, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group. During the recent pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) virus, obesity was identified as a novel independent risk factor for severity multiple markers of the disease. We reviewed the evidence associating obesity with a worse course of respiratory diseases in children. Nine out of 40 retrieved articles, were chosen to be reviewed. We concluded that there is evidence suggesting that immunomodulatory effects of obesity could be considered as a novel risk factor. Thus, bearing in mind the drastic rise in obesity prevalence around the world and in Chile, and the latent possibility of new respiratory pandemics caused by viruses, studying the possible effect of obesity aggravating viral respiratory infections will become important.","Fuenzalida, Loreto; García-Díaz, Diego F",Revista medica de Chile,95,31

The present study aimed to detect various respiratory viruses and bacteria in middle ear fluid (MEF) and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS We collected MEF and NPA samples from 122 pediatric patients with AOM. Real-time PCR detected 11 types of respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A/B, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A/B, adenovirus, human bocavirus and rhino virus) and 7 types of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Legionella pneumophila and Moraxella catarrhalis). MEF specimens were also examined using bacterial culture. RESULTS At least 1 respiratory viral or bacterial pathogen was detected in MEF of 120 cases (98%) by viral and bacterial PCR and of 93 cases (76%) by viral PCR and bacterial culture. Respiratory viruses were detected in NPA of 84 cases (69%) and MEF of 67 cases (55%). The most common virus detected in MEF was respiratory syncytial virus (21%), followed by parainfluenza virus (15%). All the viruses present in MEF were also detected in NPA specimens. Bacteria were detected by PCR in MEF of 109 cases (89%); H. influenzae was the most frequently detected (65%). CONCLUSIONS In many cases, pediatric AOM was found to constitute a respiratory polymicrobial infection. Multiplex PCR was useful to detect multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria in AOM. To understand intractable AOM, further studies regarding the clinical features of each viral and bacterial coinfection are required.","Sawada, Shoichi; Okutani, Fumino; Kobayashi, Taisuke",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,95,1

Techniques currently used in clinical diagnostics are usually time-consuming and expensive. The more sensitive and portable devices are needed for early diagnostics. Chemical sensors are devices that convert chemical information into parameters suitable for fast and precise processing and measurement. AREA COVERED We review the use of biosensors and their possible application in early diagnostics of some diseases like cancer or viral infections. We focus on different types of biorecognition and some technical modifications lowering the limit of detection potentially attractive to medical practitioners. EXPERT OPINION Among the new diagnostic strategies, the use of biosensors is of increasing interest. In these techniques the capture ligand interacts with the analyte of interest. Measuring interactions between partners in real time by surface plasmon resonance yields valuable information about kinetics and affinity in a short time and without labels. Importantly, the tendency in such techniques is to make biosensor devices smaller and the test results apparent with the naked eye, so they can be used in point-of-care medicine.","Olejnik, Beata; Kozioł, Agata; Brzozowska, Ewa; Ferens-Sieczkowska, Mirosława",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,95,30

However, similar testing-systems are too large to carry to a remote area for diagnosis or point-of-care testing. This study demonstrated a fully automatic portable biosensing system based on the microring resonator. An optical-fiber array mounted on a controller based micro-positioning system, which can be interfaced with Matlab to locate a tentative position for light source and waveguide coupling alignment. Chip adapter and microfluidic channel could be packaged as a product such that it is cheap to manufacture and can be disposed of after every test conducted. Thus, the platform can be more easily operated via an ordinary user without expertise in photonics. It is designed based on conventional optical communication wavelength range. The C-band SLEDs light source couples in/out the micro-ring sensor to obtain quasi-TE mode by grating coupler techniques. For keeping a stable chemical binding reaction, the cost-effective microfluidic pump was developed to offer a specific flow rate of 20 L/min by using a servo-motor, an Arduino board, and a motor driver. The subwavelength grating metamaterial ring resonator shows highly sensitive sensing performance via surface index changes due to biomarker adhered on the sensor. The real-time peak shifts monitoring shows 10 g/mL streptavidin detection of limit based on the biotin-streptavidin binding reaction. Through the different specific receptors immobilized on the sensor surface, the system can be utilized on the open applications such as heavy metal detection, gas sensing, virus examination and cancer marker diagnosis.","Soni, Varun; Chang, Ching-Wen; Xu, Xiaochuan; Wang, Chao; Yan, Hai; Dagati, Michael; Tu, Li-Wei; Chen, Quark Yungsung; Tian, Huiping; Chen, Ray T",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,95,1

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.","Hopkins, C; Surda, P; Kumar, N",Rhinology,95,19

Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia, it turned out that this viral disease termed COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection, but a systemic disease associated with a number of extrapulmonary complications. One of the medical disciplines that is strongly affected by this viral infection is gastroenterology. COVID-19 causes in some patients typical symptoms of enteritis such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. There is also evidence that this infection may lead to liver and pancreatic injury. Since the SARS-CoV2 virus was detected in stool, a fecal-oral route of transmission is possible. Moreover, viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and enables the invasion of the gastrointestinal epithelium as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the daily practice and the workflows in endoscopy leading to a dramatic decrease of screening and surveillance procedures. COVID-19 impacts the therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those using high doses of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics. Patients with preexisting liver disease, especially metabolic associated liver fatty disease (MALFD) with fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, are at high risk for severe COVID-19. As long as no active vaccine against SARS-CoV2 is available, gastroenterologists have to be aware of these problems that affect their daily routine practice.","Konturek, P C; Harsch, I A; Neurath, M F; Zopf, Y",Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,95,1

A growing consensus suggests that multi-plate tectonics was preceded by cooling through a single-plate lithosphere, but models for how this lithosphere was first broken into plates have not converged on a mechanism or a typical early plate scale. A commonality among prior efforts is the use of continuum mechanics approximations to evaluate this solid mechanics problem. Here we use 3D spherical shell models to demonstrate a self-organized fracture mechanism analogous to thermal expansion-driven lithospheric uplift, in which globe-spanning rifting occurs as a consequence of horizontal extension. Resultant fracture spacing is a function of lithospheric thickness and rheology, wherein geometrically-regular, polygonal-shaped tessellation is an energetically favored solution because it minimizes total crack length. Therefore, warming of the early lithosphere itself-as anticipated by previous studies-should lead to failure, propagating fractures, and the conditions necessary for the onset of multi-plate tectonics.","Tang, C A; Webb, A A G; Moore, W B; Wang, Y Y; Ma, T H; Chen, T T",Nature communications,95,31

It is unknown which psychological assessment tools are most appropriate to evaluate psychological distress in this population. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate existing assessment tools used to measure psychological distress with emphasis on citizen responders who attempted resuscitation. METHODS A systematic literature search conducted by two reviewers was carried out in March 2018 and revised in July 2018. Four databases were searched: PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and The Social Sciences Citation Index. A total of 504 studies examining assessment tools to measure psychological distress reactions after acute traumatic events were identified, and 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for further analysis. The selected studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. RESULTS The Impact of Event Scale (IES) and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were the preferred assessment tools, and were used on diverse populations exposed to various traumatic events. One study included lay rescuers performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and this study used the IES. The IES and the IES-R also have proven a high validity in various other populations. The Clinical administered PTSD scale (CAPS) was applied in two studies. Though the CAPS is comparable to both the IES-R and the IES, the CAPS assess PTSD symptoms in general and not in relation to a specific experienced event, which makes the scale less suitable when measuring stress due to a specific resuscitation attempt. CONCLUSIONS The IES and the IES-R seem to be solid measures for psychological distress among people experiencing an acute psychological traumatic event. However, only one study has assessed psychological distress among citizen responders in OHCA for which the IES-R scale was used, and therefore, further research on this topic is warranted.","Kragh, Astrid Rolin; Folke, Fredrik; Andelius, Linn; Ries, Emma Slebsager; Rasmussen, Rasmus Vedby; Hansen, Carolina Malta",BMC emergency medicine,95,19

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April-September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS During the 6-month period, 8,332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3,003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (p=0.004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management of sinusitis and viral ARTI during telemedicine visits increased from 88% (April) to 97% (September). CONCLUSION With active antibiotic stewardship, pediatricians practicing within certified medical homes consistently delivered highly guideline-concordant care for ARTIs to their patient population via telemedicine integrated into primary care.","Ray, Kristin N; Martin, Judith M; Wolfson, David; Schweiberger, Kelsey; Schoemer, Pam; Cepullio, Christine; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Hoberman, Alejandro",Academic pediatrics,95,6

The mechanisms underlying this benefit remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of stroke volume guided intra-venous fluid and low dose dopexamine on tissue microvascular flow and oxygenation and inflammatory markers in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS Randomised, controlled, single blind study of patients admitted to a university hospital critical care unit following major gastrointestinal surgery. For eight hours after surgery, intra-venous fluid therapy was guided by measurements of central venous pressure (CVP group), or stroke volume (SV group). In a third group stroke volume guided fluid therapy was combined with dopexamine (0.5 mcg/kg/min) (SV & DPX group). RESULTS 135 patients were recruited (n = 45 per group). In the SV & DPX group, increased global oxygen delivery was associated with improved sublingual (P < 0.05) and cutaneous microvascular flow (P < 0.005) (sublingual microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry). Microvascular flow remained constant in the SV group but deteriorated in the CVP group (P < 0.05). Cutaneous tissue oxygen partial pressure (PtO2) (Clark electrode) improved only in the SV & DPX group (P < 0.001). There were no differences in serum inflammatory markers. There were no differences in overall complication rates between the groups although acute kidney injury was more frequent in the CVP group (CVP group ten patients (22%); pooled SV and SV & DPX groups seven patients (8%); P = 0.03) (post hoc analysis). CONCLUSIONS Stroke volume guided fluid and low dose inotropic therapy was associated with improved global oxygen delivery, microvascular flow and tissue oxygenation but no differences in the inflammatory response to surgery. These observations may explain improved clinical outcomes associated with this treatment in previous trials.

Understanding the relationship between the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) and patient sedation level could help clinicians achieve the desired sedation level with minimal side effects. We aimed to model the relationship between the propofol Ce and adequate and deep sedation and also incorporate covariates. Thirty patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery received spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. Propofol was administered via an effect-site target-controlled infusion device using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model. The pharmacodynamic models for both adequate sedation [Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores of 3-4] and deep sedation (OAA/S scores of 1-2) were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Increments in the propofol Ce were associated with increased depths of sedation. In the basic model, the estimated population Ce50 values for adequate and deep sedation were 0.94 and 1.52 μg/ml, respectively. The inclusion of the patient's age and sensory block level for adequate sedation and of age for deep sedation as covariates significantly improved the basic model by decreasing the objective function's minimum value from 10696.72 to 10677.92 (p = 0.0003). The simulated Ce50 values for adequate sedation in 20-year-old patients with a T12 sensory level and in 80-year-old patients with a T4 level were 1.63 and 0.53 μg/ml, respectively. Both age and sensory block level should be considered for adequate sedation, and the propofol concentration should be reduced for elderly patients with a high spinal block to avoid unnecessarily deep levels of sedation.","Roh, Go Un; Kim, Youngsoon; Ha, Sang Hee; Jeong, Kyu Hee; Choi, Sumin; Han, Dong Woo",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,95,31

PATIENTS AND METHODS Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR analysis for the RdRp, N and E target genes detected viral RNA in different types of biological specimens. Whole viral genome sequences were obtained and analyzed from respiratory tract, feces and blood. RESULTS Viral sequences showed high (~99.9%) homology with the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus. Phylogenetic analysis assigned of the SARS-CoV-2 strains to clade G. A rare variant in the orf1ab gene was present in both sequences, while a missense variant was detected only in viral RNA from stool. CONCLUSIONS The evolution of the COVID-19 systemic infection in the patient presented here was favorable to the hypothesis that immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplant recipients might be involved in viral dissemination. A missense mutation was present in only one specimen from the same patient implying the occurrence of a mutational event in viral RNA, which is suggestive for the presence of an active virus, even though viral isolation is necessary to demonstrate infectivity.","Monne, M; Asproni, R; Fancello, T; Piras, G; Sulis, V; Floris, A R; Sanna, F; Toja, A; Paffi, P; Carai, A; Mameli, G; Fiamma, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,95,1

Co-existence of diabetes and obesity could cause an even higher risk of severe outcomes due to immunity dysfunction. We conducted a retrospective study in 1637 adult patients who were admitted into an acute hospital in Wuhan, China. Propensity score matched logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of severe pneumonia and requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy associated with obesity. After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, obesity was significantly associated with higher odds of severe pneumonia (odd ratio [OR] 1.47 [95% CI 1.15-1.88], P=0.002) and oxygen therapy (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.10-1.79], P=0.007). Higher ORs of severe pneumonia due to obesity were observed in men, older adults and those with diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, overweight increased the odds of requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy by 0.68 times (P=0.014) and obesity increased the odds by 1.06 times (P=0.028). A linear dose-response curve between BMI and severe outcomes was observed in all patients, whereas a U-shaped curve in those with diabetes. Our findings provide important evidence to support obesity as an independent risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection in the early phase of the ongoing pandemic.","Cao, Peihua; Song, Ying; Zhuang, Zian; Ran, Jinjun; Xu, Lin; Geng, Yan; Han, Lefei; Zhao, Shi; Qin, Jing; He, Daihai; Wu, Fengfu; Yang, Lin",Diabetes,95,24

However, the few studies involving prospectively collected blood samples have found weak and inconsistent associations with outcome and variable temporal trends in DENV-specific memory T cell responses between subjects. This study used both ex-vivo and cultured ELISPOT assays to further evaluate the associations between DENV serotype-cross-reactive memory T cells and severity of secondary infection. Using ex-vivo ELISPOT assays, frequencies of memory T cells secreting IFN-γ in response to DENV structural and non-structural peptide pools were low in PBMC from multiple time points prior to symptomatic secondary DENV infection and showed a variable response to infection. There were no differences in responses between subjects who were not hospitalized (NH, n=6) and those who were hospitalized with dengue hemorrhagic fever (hDHF, n=4). In contrast, responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were more reliably detectable prior to secondary infection and showed more consistent increases after infection. Responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were higher in individuals with hDHF (n=8) compared to NH (n=9) individuals before the secondary infection, with no difference between these groups after infection. These data demonstrate an association of pre-existing DENV-specific memory responses with the severity of illness in subsequent DENV infection, and suggest that frequencies of DENV-reactive T cells measured after short-term culture may be of particular importance for assessing the risk for more severe dengue disease.","Sanchez-Vargas, Luis Alberto; Anderson, Kathryn B; Srikiatkhachorn, Anon; Currier, Jeffrey R; Friberg, Heather; Endy, Timothy P; Fernandez, Stefan; Mathew, Anuja; Rothman, Alan L",Frontiers in immunology,95,7

RESULTS Approximately half of UK orchestras are engaged significantly in the area of health and well-being in all four UK nations and a wide range of healthcare settings. There is a strong appetite to develop this work among those orchestras not yet involved. At the same time, the extent of this work is not formally recognised or paid for by the healthcare sector. CONCLUSIONS While there is considerable unevenness in the provision, it is clear that UK professional orchestras made a significant contribution to the health and well-being sectors in hospitals and other healthcare settings.

However, a microbial biofilm is formed gradually on this tube and is associated with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The bacteria present in the biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics, and current medical practices do not make it possible to eliminate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading pathogens that cause biofilm infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Poly-l-lysine (pLK) is a cationic polypeptide possessing antibacterial properties and mucolytic activity by compacting DNA. Here, we explored the antibiofilm activity of pLK to treat P. aeruginosa biofilms on ETTs while taking into consideration the necessary constraints for clinical translation in our experimental designs. First, we showed that pLK eradicates a P. aeruginosa biofilm formed in vitro on 96-well microplates. We further demonstrated that pLK alters bacterial membrane integrity, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, and eventually eradicates biofilm formed either by reference or clinical strains of P. aeruginosa biofilms generated in vitro on ETTs. Second, we collected the ETT from patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. We observed that a single dose of pLK is able to immediately disrupt the biofilm structure and kills more than 90% of bacteria present in the biofilm. Additionally, we did not observe any lung tolerance issue when the pLK solution was instilled into the ETT of ventilated pigs, an animal model particularly relevant to mimic invasive mechanical ventilation in humans. In conclusion, pLK appears as an innovative antibiofilm molecule, which could be applied in the ETT of mechanically ventilated patients.","Guillon, Antoine; Fouquenet, Delphine; Morello, Eric; Henry, Clémence; Georgeault, Sonia; Si-Tahar, Mustapha; Hervé, Virginie",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,95,1

Expressing outcomes using the mean and standard deviation might not adequately describe the clinical experience. This could in part be because the use of the mean +/- standard deviation assumes a normal or random distribution of outcomes. It has been our perception that the weight loss results after gastric bypass are relatively normally and tightly distributed around the mean, making it relatively predictable. However, we have found that the results after adjustable gastric banding are more highly variable. In fact, there appears to be 2 groups of patients after this restrictive operation. One group, that is able to work well and does not struggle much against the restriction, accepts the limits that it imposes, and another group, that does not easily learn to deal with the restriction and hence mal-adapts. METHODS To evaluate the validity of our clinical perception, we undertook an analysis of the distribution of weight loss by the percentiles of excess weight lost. All patients with follow-up of > or =1 years after gastric bypass or adjustable banding were evaluated for this analysis. The demographics and percentage of excess weight loss were evaluated. The distribution of the percentage of excess weight loss in 10% increments was evaluated. RESULTS Both groups were similar with respect to the mean patient age. However, the patients in the gastric bypass group had had a significantly greater mean preoperative body mass index and were more likely to be women. As expected, the weight loss of the gastric bypass patients fell in a normal single-peak distribution for < or =5 years of follow-up. The data from the adjustable gastric band patients at 1 year demonstrated a normal single-peak distribution, with a longer rightward tail. At 2 and 3 years postoperatively, the data from the band patients had a 2-peaked curve. CONCLUSION The initial weight loss results after gastric banding are less predictable than those after gastric bypass. A similar analysis of long-term outcomes might be enlightening and assist in making clinical decisions.","Bessler, Marc; Daud, Amna; DiGiorgi, Mary F; Schrope, Beth A; Inabnet, William B; Davis, Daniel G",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,95,16

DISCUSSION Although there is a low incidence of injury to non-scaphoid carpal bones, it is beneficial to understand the approach to the perilunate reduction and scaphoid fixation through a combined volar and dorsal approach, which will also allow for the reduction and fixation of more rare and complex carpal fractures.","Apostolides, John G; Lifchez, Scott D; Christy, Michael R",Hand,95,1

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated our democratic processes. Voters and poll workers feel threatened by the potential dangers of voting in business-as-usual polling stations. Indeed, significant problems were encountered in the recent 2020 primary elections in Wisconsin, where the National Guard had to be mobilized because so few poll workers reported to work, and more than 90% of polling places had to remain closed. METHOD We describe a number of possible user-centered solutions that would help protect voters and poll workers in times of pandemic, and also report the results of a survey that asked voters and poll workers about what kinds of systems might make them willing to vote. RESULTS Political as well as safety considerations will need to be considered as these safer voting solutions are designed since, surprisingly, the kinds of solutions preferred depend on the political affiliation of the voters. CONCLUSION Human factors professionals have a large role to play in realizing the safe, successful implementation of these user-centered systems. Good human factors analysis can help minimize the risk to voters and poll workers. Moreover, human factors methods can help safeguard democracy by creating safe and well-engineered environments that are conducive to voting in the age of pandemics.

METHODS A systematic search of the literature was conducted in June 2017 and repeated in December 2020. The systematic review included 13 studies. Analyses of pooled original data were based on the six studies providing data (n = 1594). No studies on forensic psychiatric conditions were eligible. Hours and weeks worked were analyzed using linear regression. Employment, and time to employment was analyzed using logistic regression, and cox-regression, respectively. RESULTS The effects on hours and weeks in employment after 18 months were comparable for participants with schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder but only statistically significant for participants with schizophrenia compared to services as usual (SAU) (EMD 109.1 h (95% CI 60.5-157.7), 6.1 weeks (95% CI 3.9-8.4)). The effect was also significant for participants with any drug use disorder (121.2 h (95% CI 23.6-218.7), 6.8 weeks (95% CI 1.8-11.8)). Participants with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and any drug use disorder had higher odds of being competitively employed (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.7); 2.4 (95% CI 1.3-4.4); 3.0 (95% CI 1.5-5.8)) and returned to work faster than SAU (HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.6); 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-3.1); 3.0 (95% CI 1.6-5.7)). No statistically significant effects were found regarding depression.

One potential contributor to these challenges is the use of pesticides, particularly aquatic herbicides applied to aquatic habitats inhabited by amphibians. Critical issues of concern are the potential toxicity and teratogenicity of these herbicides towards amphibians. Using the FETAX protocol, three globally used formulations, including diquat dibromide (Midstream), glufosinate ammonium (Basta), and imazapyr (Arsenal), were assessed for embryotoxicity, teratogenicity, and growth inhibition. Developing Xenopus laevis embryos were exposed for 96 h at concentrations of 0.5-3.0 mg/L, 1.6-3.0 mg/L, and 20-45 mg/L for Midstream, Basta, and Arsenal respectively. The 96-h LC50 estimates were 0.83 mg/L acid equivalent (a.e.), 36 mg/L a.e., and 2.2 mg/L a.e., whereas the EC50 estimates were 0.24 mg/L a.e., 28.13 mg/L a.e., and 2.01 mg/L a.e. for the Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta formulations, respectively. These two estimates produced Teratogenic Index of 3.5, 1.3, and 1.1 for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, indicating a high risk of malformation induction by Midstream and moderate risk for Arsenal. Regarding growth inhibition, lowest observable effect concentrations of 0.5 mg/L, 25 mg/L, and 2.0 mg/L were computed for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, producing the minimum concentration inhibiting growth (MCIG) ratios of 0.62, 0.69, and 0.89 for the three formulations. These MICG values are higher than the standard 0.30 growth inhibitors benchmark, suggesting that the formulations are not growth inhibitors at the evaluated concentrations. This study provides evidence of the embryotoxic and teratogenic status of Midstream and the embryotoxicity of Basta. There is a need to further characterise the physiological and ecological impacts of these formulations to ensure responsible use and the safety of amphibians and other wildlife.","Babalola, Oluwaseun Olusegun; Truter, Johannes Christoff; Van Wyk, Johannes Hannes",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,95,25

In our patients, minor postoperative complications were followed after a few years by more serious problems (persistent abdominal pain, infections, intestinal perforations). In this study, we take stock after a 5-year follow-up and issue a plea for improved product development strategies and the creation of hernia registries. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2006, we implanted the Bard(®) Composix(®) Kugel(®) mesh in 21 patients (11 men, 10 women, mean age 63.2 ± 13.7 years) with incisional hernias using the open intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique. The mesh is made on one side of ePTFE and on the other of polypropylene and is expanded by a polyethylene (PET) memory recoil ring. The average follow-up was 45.5 months. All patients had at least one risk factor for hernia recurrence. Explanted prostheses were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and subjected to mechanical strength tests. RESULTS During the postoperative course, six patients suffered a wound healing disorder. Ten patients complained of persistent abdominal wall pain and four experienced recurrence of the hernia. In one patient, the mesh had to be explanted due to chronic infection. In one patient, the PET memory recoil ring broke after 5 years of follow-up with consequent small bowel perforation. The PET memory recoil ring exhibited clear signs of degradation on SEM and unmistakable signs of material fatigue in a materials testing machine. CONCLUSIONS Patients with recalled Composix Kugel meshes face a singular risk for complications that may occur even many years after implantation. The most serious complication is the breakage of its PET memory recoil ring. Since the recall of the Composix Kugel Mesh, we have discontinued its use. It is necessary that future complications are documented in a common post-market surveillance registry. Algorithms need to be developed and promoted to support affected patients and surgeons.","Wiegering, A; Schlegel, N; Isbert, C; Jurowich, C; Doht, S; Germer, C T; Dietz, U A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,95,1

RARC is gaining popularity, especially in high-volume centres, although there remains a lack of level 1 evidence to demonstrate any superiority of RARC over ORC. All previously reported studies that randomised ORC and RARC have utilised a technique for RARC requiring a conversion to open surgery for urinary diversion. Conversion to open surgery invariably masks the benefits of a truly minimally invasive approach. Moreover, such studies tend to report a small sample size, likely reflecting early surgical experience that may contribute to the lack of observed benefit. Nonetheless, it is established that short-term oncological outcomes following RARC are comparable to those after ORC. It is likely that the benefits of RARC are only observed in cases wherein intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) is performed by a surgical team with high volume experience, which will minimise morbidity and maximise early return to normal function. In this review, we will discuss a holistic approach to iRARC, including patient selection, perioperative optimisation, the surgical technique for iRARC with urinary diversion reconstruction, the use of enhanced recovery protocol, oncological outcomes and perioperative complications.","Tan, Wei Shen; Lamb, Benjamin W; Sridhar, Ashwin; Briggs, Timothy P; Kelly, John D",Urologia,95,31

Different ultrasound markers have been reported with varying sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound markers for LUTO. We performed a systematic literature review of studies reporting on fetuses with hydronephrosis or a prenatally suspected and/or postnatally confirmed diagnosis of LUTO. Bayesian bivariate random effects meta-analytic models were fitted, and we calculated posterior means and 95% credible intervals (CrI) for the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). A total of 36,189 studies were identified; 636 studies were available for full text review and a total of 42 studies were included in the Bayesian meta-analysis. Megacystis (DOR 49.15, [15.28, 177.44]), bilateral hydroureteronephrosis (DOR 41.33, [13.36,164.83]), bladder thickening (DOR 13.73, [1.23, 115.20]), bilateral hydronephrosis (DOR 8.36 [3.17, 21.91]), male sex (DOR 8.08 [3.05, 22.82]), oligohydramnios or anhydramnios (DOR 7.75 [4.23, 14.46]), and urinoma (DOR 7.47 [1.14, 33.18]) were found to be predictive of LUTO. The predictive sensitivities and specificities are low and wide study heterogeneity existed. Megacystis, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and bladder wall thickening are the most accurate predictors of LUTO. Given the significant consequences of a missed LUTO diagnosis, clinicians providing counselling for prenatal hydronephrosis should maintain a low threshold for considering LUTO as part of the differential diagnosis.

We report a paper-based sensor system for a point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test that can quantitatively detect multiple genes from different pathogens. The POC system combines a paper sensor chip and a portable instrument, which is built on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The paper-based sensor provides the functions of reagent storage, sample transportation, and nucleic acid amplification. The IoT instrument uses an Arduino microcontroller to control temperature, collect fluorescence images, and store the data in cloud storage via a WiFi network. A compact fluorescence reader was designed to measure fluorescence images of the amplicons during a loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction in real-time. The real-time detection capability enables the quantitative analysis of target genes. The results show that the paper-based sensor cam distinguish multiple genes of the genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni, with the concentration as low as 2 × 103 copies/μL. The affordable instrument, in conjunction with the disposable paper sensor chip, would have a great potential for POC detections of pathogens.","Liu, Mingdian; Zhao, Yuxin; Monshat, Hosein; Tang, Zheyuan; Wu, Zuowei; Zhang, Qijing; Lu, Meng",Biosensors & bioelectronics,95,1

This study examined how the sense of control influences people's perception of sensorimotor input under the framework of categorical perception. Twenty human participants (18 males, two females) took part in both experiments. Experiment 1 showed that the sensitivity (d') of detecting a 20% change in control from no change was higher when the changes occurred at the control-category boundary than within each category. Experiment 2 showed that the control categories greatly affected early attention allocation, even when the judgment of control was unnecessary to the task. Taken together, these results showed that our perceptual and cognitive systems are highly sensitive to small changes in control that build up to a determinant change in the control category within a relatively narrow boundary zone between categories, compared to a continuous, gradual physical change in control.Significance Statement Categorical perception is an important cognitive function that connects human low-level perceptual systems with high-level conceptual systems. Categorical perception has been intensively studied with sensory features (e.g., color and faces), but little is known about sensorimotor information, despite its importance for interacting with the external world. This is the first study to show that individuals perceive their control in meaningful categories rather than via linear encoding. The categorical perception of control diminishes sensitivity to differences within control categories, while increasing sensitivity to sensorimotor inputs at the control-category boundaries. The findings broaden our understanding on how human action influences the perception of action consequences, and how humans organize the external world according to the consequences of their actions.","Wen, Wen; Shimazaki, Naoto; Ohata, Ryu; Yamashita, Atsushi; Asama, Hajime; Imamizu, Hiroshi",eNeuro,95,1

Routine 2, 6, 9-12, and 16-20 month follow-up angiograms were compared, with a focus on changes in stent configuration and location from immediately after deployment to angiographic follow-up, and the incidence and development of in-stent stenosis. Thirty-four patients with 42 aneurysms met inclusion criteria. The Silk device was implanted in 16 patients (47%, single device in 15), the Pipeline device in 18 (53%, single device in 16). On first follow-up angiography, in-stent stenosis was observed in 38% of Silk devices and 39% of Pipeline devices. In-stent stenosis was asymptomatic in 12 of 13 patients. One woman presented with transient ischemic attacks and required stent angioplasty due to end tapering and mild, diffuse in-stent stenosis. Configuration and location changes, including stent creeping and end tapering were seen in 2/16 patients (13%) with Silk devices, and 0/18 patients with Pipeline devices. We describe stent creeping and end tapering as unusual findings with the potential for delayed clinical complications. In-stent stenosis, with a unique behavior, is a frequent angiographic finding observed after flow-diverter stent implant. The stenosis is usually asymptomatic; however, close clinical and angiographic monitoring is mandatory for individualized management.","Cohen, José E; Gomori, John Moshe; Moscovici, Samuel; Leker, Ronen R; Itshayek, Eyal",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,95,5

Currently, it is utmost important to produce novel small molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs urgently that can save human lives globally. Based on the earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection along with the general characters of coronaviral replication, a number of drug molecules have been proposed. However, one of the major limitations is the lack of experimental observations with different drug molecules. In this article, 70 diverse chemicals having experimental SARS-CoV-2 3CLproinhibitory activity were accounted for robust classification-based QSAR analysis statistically validated with 4 different methodologies to recognize the crucial structural features responsible for imparting the activity. Results obtained from all these methodologies supported and validated each other. Important observations obtained from these analyses were also justified with the ligand-bound crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme. Our results suggest that molecules should contain a 2-oxopyrrolidine scaffold as well as a methylene (hydroxy) sulphonic acid warhead in proper orientation to achieve higher inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

Inadequately managed postsurgical pain has both clinical and economic consequences such as longer recovery times, delayed ambulation, higher incidence of complications, increased length of hospital stay, and potential to develop into chronic pain. Generally, opioids are the mainstay option for pain management in patients with moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain; however, opioids have significant side effects and have abuse potential. To improve patient and economic outcomes after surgery, postoperative pain guidelines have suggested incorporating a multi-modal/multi-mechanistic approach to pain treatment. A multi-modal approach is the simultaneous use of a combination of two or more (usually opioid and non-opioid) analgesics that provide two different mechanisms of actions. Utilizing a multi-modal approach may result in a greater reduction in pain vs. single therapies in addition to minimizing opioid use, thus reducing opioid related side effects. However, not all approaches may be effective for all types of patients and not all analgesics may be a viable option for outpatient settings, ambulatory surgery, or the fast-track surgical procedures. In this report, we present a review of the literature with a focus on intranasal ketorolac in order to provide a timely update regarding past, present, and future multi-modal treatment options for postoperative pain.","Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Taylor, Robert; Raffa, Robert B",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,95,27

Caused by a novel human coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine storm syndromes due to innate immune activation. Primary immunodeficiency (PID) cases represent a special patient population whose impaired immune system might make them susceptible to severe infections, posing a higher risk to COVID-19, but this could also lead to suppressed inflammatory responses and cytokine storm. It remains an open question as to whether the impaired immune system constitutes a predisposing or protective factor for PID patients when facing SARS-CoV-2 infection. After literature review, it was found that, similar to other patient populations with different comorbidities, PID patients may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their varied immune status, however, may lead to different disease severity and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. PID patients with deficiency in antiviral innate immune signaling [eg, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, or interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)] or interferon signaling (IFNAR2) may be linked to severe COVID-19.

This study investigated the key considerations in genetic counseling practices that impact the decision to implement innovative SDMs, as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation. A cross-sectional, qualitative research design was employed, using focus groups. Genetic counselors (GCs) were recruited from respondents to an online survey about SDMs and by posting an invitation to the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) listserv. A total of 30 participants participated in either in-person (n = 3) or online (n = 5) focus groups, facilitated by members of the Service Delivery Model subcommittee of the NSGC Access and Service Delivery Committee. Transcribed audio and written notes from the focus groups were coded, utilizing an inductive thematic analysis method. Five overarching themes that impact decisions to implement and use innovative SDMs were identified: (a) Patient volume and efficiency are key motivators in trying innovative SDMs; (b) the decision to change is facilitated by available resources; (c) the implementation of innovative SDMs is multidimensional and complex process; (d) there is concern about the impact on patient-provider relationships with the utilization of innovative SDMs; and (e) measuring outcomes of innovative SDM facilitates acquisition of additional resources and support. Approaches to innovative SDM selection and implementation vary by institution needs, resources, and population as demonstrated by the variety of approaches to similar barriers. Outcomes related to the implementation of innovative SDMs in genetic counseling practice should be measured to demonstrate the value of innovative genetic counseling SDMs, improvement of access to care, and to justify need for additional resources to support implementation of these models.","Khan, Ambreen; Cohen, Stephanie; Weir, Charlene; Greenberg, Samantha",Journal of genetic counseling,95,11

Multiple organ failure often complicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) evolution and is associated with high mortality. The effect of early hepatic dysfunction on ARDS mortality has been poorly investigated. We evaluated the incidence and the prognostic significance of increased serum bilirubin levels in the initial phase of ARDS. METHODS The data of 805 patients with ARDS were retrospectively analysed. This population was extracted from two recent multicenter, prospective and randomised trials. Patients presenting with ARDS with a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen < 150 mmHg measured with a PEEP ≥ 5 cm of water were included. The total serum bilirubin was measured at inclusion and at days 2, 4, 7 and 14. The primary objective was to analyse the bilirubin at inclusion according to the 90-day mortality rate. RESULTS The 90-day mortality rate was 33.8% (n = 272). The non-survivors were older, had higher Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and were more likely to have a medical diagnosis on admission than the survivors. At inclusion, the SOFA score without the liver score (10.3±2.9 vs. 9.0±3.0, p<0.0001) and the serum bilirubin levels (36.1±57.0 vs. 20.5±31.5 μmol/L, p<0.0001) were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors. Age, the hepatic SOFA score, the coagulation SOFA score, the arterial pH level, and the plateau pressure were independently associated with 90-day mortality in patients with ARDS. CONCLUSION Bilirubin used as a surrogate marker of hepatic dysfunction and measured early in the course of ARDS was associated with the 90-day mortality rate.","Dizier, Stéphanie; Forel, Jean-Marie; Ayzac, Louis; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Hraiech, Sami; Lehingue, Samuel; Loundou, Anderson; Roch, Antoine; Guerin, Claude; Papazian, Laurent",PloS one,95,19

Methods. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (2019-01132 CE-3495). Patients undergoing R-TAPP for direct inguinal hernia from October 2017 to December 2019 were included. In all patients, a barbed running suture of the transversalis fascia was performed to close the cavity resulting from the direct hernia reduction and to fix it to the Cooper ligament, then a lightweight mesh was placed. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analysed. Results. Over the study period, 67 R-TAPP in 51 patients were identified. All patients were male, with a mean age of 63.1 ± 12.7 years. There was 1 case of conversion to open surgery due to adhesions of the caecum to the groin as a result of perforated appendicitis. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1.8 ± .6 days. After discharge, no cases of seroma or recurrence at 30 days nor chronic pain at a mean follow-up of 10.3 ± 6.8 months was detected. Conclusions. In the treatment of direct inguinal hernia with R-TAPP, suturing and anchoring the transversalis fascia to the Cooper ligament are safe, feasible and recommendable in order to prevent postoperative seromas.","Pini, Ramon; Mongelli, Francesco; Proietti, Francesco; Cianfarani, Agnese; Garofalo, Fabio; Di Giuseppe, Matteo; La Regina, Davide",Surgical innovation,95,1

AIM To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation. METHOD An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs. RESULTS A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor. CONCLUSIONS Family health, news media consumption, and loss of work hours are associated with COVID-19 protection motivation. COVID-19 protection motivation might be enhanced through policies and messaging that can affect ecological sources of influence.","Hanson, Carl L; Crandall, Ali; Barnes, Michael D; Novilla, M Lelinneth",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,95,9

AdVs are produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney 239 (HEK293) or PER.C6 virus producer cells with AdV plasmid vectors or infecting these cells withcell lysates containing replication-defective AdV. Cell lysates can be purified further by caesium chloride or chromatographic protocols to research virus seed stocks (RVSS) for characterisation to high quality master virus seed stocks (MVSS) and working virus seed stocks (WVSS) before downstream production of pure, high titre AdV. Lysates are poorly infectious, block filtration columns and have limited storage capability. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) are an alternative method for AdV purification that rapidly generates cleaner RVSS for characterisation to MVSS. After testing multiple ATPS formulations, an aqueous mixture of 20% PEG 600 and 20% (NH4)2SO4 (w/w) was found most effective for AdV partitioning, producing up to 97+3% yield of high-titre virus that was devoid of aggregates both effective in vitro and in vivo with no observable cytotoxicity. Importantly, AdV preparations stored at -20 °C or 4 °C show negligible loss of titre and are suitable for downstream processing to clinical grade to support the need for AdV vaccines.","Suleman, Saqlain; Schrubaji, Kuteiba; Filippou, Chrysovalanto; Ignatova, Svetlana; Hewitson, Peter; Huddleston, Jonathan; Karda, Rajvinder; Waddington, Simon; Themis, Michael",Journal of virological methods,95,1

Since the widely used ultracentrifugation for concentrating viral stock requires ultra-high speed rotation, it easily destroys the activity of some viruses, for instance, hepatitis c virus (HCV), which has a fragile structure and low virus titer. We introduce a novel method to concentrate HCV virus in stock by using a hierarchically self-organized monolithic nanoporous membrane made by stepwise anodization. The pores at the top part of the membrane have very regular sizes that are suitable for the perfect filtration of the virus particles in the stock. On the other hand, the remaining part has large pores that maintain high flux and mechanical strength of the membrane under the high pressure (up to 10 bar). The enrichment efficiency of HCV in crude stocks by using the membrane became over 91%, which is four times higher than that (∼22%) obtained by conventionally used centrifugation. A very high efficiency results from the perfect filtration and no damage to the virion particles during the enrichment process, whereas significant damage to the HCV occurs during centrifugation. The hierarchically self-organized monolithic nanoporous membrane could be effectively employed for concentrating various fragile viruses in stocks, for instance, rabies virus and human immunodeficiency virus in addition to HCV virus.","Jeon, Gumhye; Jee, Minhyeok; Yang, Seung Yun; Lee, Bom-Yi; Jang, Sung Key; Kim, Jin Kon",ACS applied materials & interfaces,95,33

This minimally invasive technique places special demands on the surgeons. Using simulation-based training on artificial models or animals has been proposed to overcome the initial part of the learning curve. This study aimed to investigate the effect of simulation-based training and to compare self-guided and educator-guided training. METHODS The study included a surgeon group (n = 10) and 30 randomized novices in 3 groups. A control group (n = 10) and the group of surgeons (n = 10) were tested with no previous simulator training. A self-guided training group (n = 10) and an educator-guided training group (n = 10) trained for 3 hours on 3 scenarios of increasing fidelity and difficulty before taking a standardized test consisting of performing a wedge resection on a porcine lung, which was recorded and assessed blindly and independently by 2 thoracoscopic experts using a modified version of a validated assessment tool. RESULTS Interrater reliability was acceptable (Spearman ρ = 0.73, P < 0.001). The control group and the self-guided training group performed significantly worse than the experienced surgeons (P = 0.012 and P = 0.010, respectively). There was no significant difference between the educator-guided training group and the experienced surgeons (P = 0.271). CONCLUSIONS This randomized study concerning simulation-based training for thoracoscopy showed that 3 hours of intensive simulator training with a dedicated educator enables novices to perform an acceptable wedge resection in a simple, simulated model. Although not significant, it seemed that having an educator present during training had a beneficiary effect. Transfer studies are required for further conclusions.","Bjurström, Johanna Margareta; Konge, Lars; Lehnert, Per; Krogh, Charlotte Loumann; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Petersen, René Horsleben; Ringsted, Charlotte",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,95,1

Presence of space-size effect related to a difference between antigen and antibody particle sizes has been theoretically grounded and experimentally proven. Herewith, the difference between responses of the SPR-sensor to specific and non-specific interactions is considerably less (up to 6.3 times) than the expected one (8 - 11 times). An impact of functionalization of sensor's sensitive element surface, as well as acidity of buffer solution on the activity of antigen-antibody interaction was studied here. The difference between sensor's responses to specific and non-specific interactions increased two-fold from 200 to 432ang sec due to this treatment. When changing the acidity of analyzed solution from pH7.3 to pH6.8, the corresponding difference between sensor's responses increased by 6.3 times from 194 up to 1235ang.sec. Thus, an impact of space-size effect on interaction between IBV antigen and specific antibody can be considerably (almost in 3 times) decreased by reducing the acidity of used buffer solution. The results of our investigation can be successfully applied to develop new methods for detection of pathogens and specific antibodies using SPR.","Klestova, Z S; Voronina, A K; Yushchenko, A Yu; Vatlitsova, O S; Dorozinsky, G V; Ushenin, Yu V; Maslov, V P; Doroshenko, T P; Kravchenko, S A","Spectrochimica acta.

TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor that interacts with CD155 and CD112 molecules, is considered as a checkpoint in T and NK cell activation. This receptor shares ligands with the co-stimulatory receptor DNAM-1 and with TACTILE. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE in NK cells and T cell subsets in AML patients. Methods: We have studied 36 patients at the time of diagnosis of AML and 20 healthy volunteers. The expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE in NK cells and T cells, according to the expression of CD3 and CD56, was performed by flow cytometry. Results: NK cells, CD56- T cells and CD56+ T (NKT-like) cells from AML patients presented a reduced expression of DNAM-1 compared with healthy volunteers. An increased expression of TIGIT was observed in mainstream CD56- T cells. No differences were observed in the expression of TACTILE. Simplified presentation of incredibly complex evaluations (SPICE) analysis of the co-expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE showed an increase in NK and T cells lacking DNAM-1 and co-expressing TIGIT and TACTILE. Low percentages of DNAM-1-TIGIT+TACTILE+ NK cells and DNAM-1- TIGIT+TACTILE+ CD56- T cells were associated with a better survival of AML patients. Conclusions: The expression of DNAM-1 is reduced in NK cells and in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from AML patients compared with those from healthy volunteers. An increased percentage of NK and T cells lacking DNAM-1 and co-expressing TIGIT and TACTILE is associated with patient survival, supporting the role of TIGIT as a novel candidate for checkpoint blockade.","Valhondo, Isabel; Hassouneh, Fakhri; Lopez-Sejas, Nelson; Pera, Alejandra; Sanchez-Correa, Beatriz; Guerrero, Beatriz; Bergua, Juan M; Arcos, Maria Jose; Bañas, Helena; Casas-Avilés, Ignacio; Sanchez-Garcia, Joaquin; Serrano, Josefina; Martin, Carmen; Duran, Esther; Alonso, Corona; Solana, Rafael; Tarazona, Raquel",Cancers,95,17

The resultant increase in prescribing was accompanied by an increase in adverse events, including severe toxicity and death. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup sought to determine the effect of and indications for extracorporeal treatments in cases of poisoning with these drugs. METHODS We conducted systematic reviews of the literature, screened studies, extracted data, and summarized findings following published EXTRIP methods. RESULTS A total of 44 studies (three in vitro studies, two animal studies, 28 patient reports or patient series, and 11 pharmacokinetic studies) met inclusion criteria regarding the effect of extracorporeal treatments. Toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis was available for 61 patients (13 chloroquine, three hydroxychloroquine, and 45 quinine). Clinical data were available for analysis from 38 patients, including 12 with chloroquine toxicity, one with hydroxychloroquine toxicity, and 25 with quinine toxicity. All three drugs were classified as non-dialyzable (not amenable to clinically significant removal by extracorporeal treatments). The available data do not support using extracorporeal treatments in addition to standard care for patients severely poisoned with either chloroquine or quinine (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although hydroxychloroquine was assessed as being non-dialyzable, the clinical evidence was not sufficient to support a formal recommendation regarding the use of extracorporeal treatments for this drug. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our systematic review and analysis, the EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using extracorporeal methods to enhance elimination of these drugs in patients with severe chloroquine or quinine poisoning.","Berling, Ingrid; King, Joshua D; Shepherd, Greene; Hoffman, Robert S; Alhatali, Badria; Lavergne, Valery; Roberts, Darren M; Gosselin, Sophie; Wilson, Gabrielle; Nolin, Thomas D; Ghannoum, Marc",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,95,1

However, the factors explaining such phenological diversity of plants have not been fully investigated. We hypothesize that species traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), seed mass, stem tissue mass density (STD), maximum plant height (Hmax), and relative growth rate in height (RGRH), explain variation in plant phenology, and tested this hypothesis in an alpine meadow. Results showed that both LMA and STD were positively correlated with the onset (i.e., beginning) and offset (i.e., ending) times of the four life history events including two reproductive events (flowering and fruiting) and two vegetative events (leafing and senescing). In contrast, RGRH was negatively correlated with the four life phenological events. Moreover, Hmax was positively correlated with reproductive events but not with vegetative events. However, none of the eight phenological events was associated with seed size. In addition, the combination of LMA and STD accounted for 50% of the variation in plant phenologies. Phylogenetic generalized least squares analysis showed plant phylogeny weakened the relationships between species traits vs. phenologies. Phylogeny significantly regulated the variation in the ending but not the beginning of phenologies. Our results indicate that species traits are robust indicators for plant phenologies and can be used to explain the diversity of plant phenologies among co-occurring herbaceous species in grasslands. The findings highlight the important role of the combination of and trade-offs between functional traits in determing plant phenology diversity in the alpine meadow.","Liu, Yinzhan; Li, Guoyong; Wu, Xinwei; Niklas, Karl J; Yang, Zhongling; Sun, Shucun",Oecologia,95,19

They incur significant patient morbidity and health care costs. Negative-pressure dressings (NPDs) applied over closed incisions may minimize wound complications. However, its utility in the emergency setting is unknown. Here, we examined whether prophylactic NPD reduces wound complications after emergency laparotomies. METHODS This is a retrospective review of consecutive emergency laparotomies undertaken at a university hospital from January 2018 to October 2019. Outcomes included the rate of SSI, wound breakdown, hospital-outreach service utilization, wound-related readmissions, and length of stay. Propensity score matched analysis was used to assess bias. RESULTS A total of 227 emergency laparotomies were reviewed, 70 received NPD and 157 had conventional dressings (controls). SSI was identified in 33 (21.0%) patients from the control group and six (8.6%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.85, P = 0.022). Wound breakdown was observed in 21 (13.4%) patients from the control group and three (4.3%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.91, P = 0.040). The prophylactic benefit of NPD was most evident in clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty wounds. The NPD group had comparatively shorter postoperative stay, less outreach service utilization, and lower rates of wound-related readmissions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increasing age, body weight >75 kg, and wound contamination are independent predictors of wound complications, whereas NPD prevented SSI and wound breakdown. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic NPD significantly reduced wound complications after emergency laparotomy. This was associated with a substantial health resource saving. This study provides a strong rationale for randomized trials in this area.","Liu, David S; Cheng, Chao; Islam, Rumana; Tacey, Mark; Sidhu, Ankur; Lam, David; Strugnell, Neil",The Journal of surgical research,95,31

METHODS Medical records of consecutive patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty performed by the senior authors (A.L. and G.W.C.) at Emory University Hospital between 1997 and 2018 were reviewed. Data regarding patient demographics, personal or family history of malignancy, operative technique, pathologic findings, and follow-up were extracted. Patients were categorized into two groups, those with and those without breast cancer. Group A patients underwent reduction for symptomatic macromastia, and group B underwent contralateral reduction for unilateral breast cancer treated with oncoplastic partial or total breast cancer reconstruction. Pathologic findings were divided into four groups; normal, benign, high-risk, and malignant. RESULTS A total 1014 patients (1419 breast reductions) were included in the study. Comparing groups A and B, mean age was 37.8 ± 16.2 years versus 54.5 ± 11.1 years (p < 0.001), mean body mass index was 34.1 ± 7.6 kg/m2 versus 33.3 ± 7.4 kg/m2 (p = 0.2), and average reduction weight was 875.6 ± 491 g versus 723.7 ± 438 g (p < 0.001). The incidence of high-risk or malignant lesions was 1.8 percent (n = 15) in group A and 8 percent (n = 49) in group B (p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age and personal history of breast cancer were positive predictors for high-risk and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of abnormal pathologic findings in breast reduction specimens is not uncommon, and occult malignancy or high-risk lesions can be found, especially in patients with contralateral breast cancer. Appropriate specimen orientation, diligence with checking the pathologic findings, and open communication with the pathologist are crucial.

Surgical management is generally reserved for patients who developed complications of the disease or who are unresponsive to or develop complications from aggressive medical therapy. Friable mesentery, inflammatory phlegmons, fistulas, abscesses, and adhesions from previous surgeries pose a surgical challenge to the laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic approach to terminal ileal Crohn's disease is feasible and safe even in cases complicated by fistulas with previous abdominal surgery or recurrent disease. This approach is associated with an increased operative time compared to laparotomy, however, offers significant advantages over open ileocolic resection in terms of pulmonary function, length of hospital stay, duration of postoperative ileus, cosmesis, postoperative small bowel obstruction, and early postoperative complications.

Its successes lead to applications of modeling methods not only to HIV but a plethora of other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), which along with HIV cause chronic diseases, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which generally cause acute infections. Here we first review the historical development of mathematical models to understand HIV and HCV infections and the effects of treatment by fitting the models to clinical data. We then focus on recent efforts and contributions of applying these models towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight outstanding questions where modeling can provide crucial insights and help to optimize non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review is written from our personal perspective emphasizing the power of simple target cell limited models that provided important insights and then their evolution into more complex models that captured more of the virology and immunology.

We compared the effectiveness of two brands of oximeters to perform it. Methods In neonates, a term of the joint housing service of the Hospital General de Occidente in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico, from May to November 2018, an examination of the characteristics of the American Academy of Pediatrics with both oximeters (ChoiceMMed® and Masimo SET®) was carried out, comparing the detection of critical congenital heart disease, time of intake, and false positives. Results In each group, 1022 patients were analyzed; with the Masimo SET® oximeter, 83 positive tests were obtained (8.12%), of which 22 cases had some heart disease (26.5%), which represents a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.9%, positive predictive value of 26.5%, and negative predictive value of 100% (odds ratio [OR]: 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-0.8). With the ChoiceMMed® oximeter, 168 positive tests were obtained (16.4%), of which 22 cases had some heart disease (13.09%), with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 85.4%, positive predictive value of 13.09%, and negative predictive value 100% (OR: 0.86; 95%CI: 0.8-0.92). Regarding the time to perform the cardiac sieve, the mean in minutes of the Masimo SET® oximeter was 5.38 and the ChoiceMMed® oximeter was 9.7 min. Conclusions The ChoiceMMed® oximeter contains a large number of false positives and a greater number of echocardiograms and comparatively longer cardiac screen printing with Masimo SET®, however, both with a negative predictive value of 100% eliminating such excuses.","Peña-Juárez, Rocío A; Chávez-Saenz, Jorge A; García-Canales, Adrián; Medina-Andrade, Miguel A; Martínez-González, María T; Gutiérrez-Cobián, Lorenzo; Mendoza-Silva, Daniela A; Valerio-Carballo, Cesar A; Gallardo-Meza, Antonio F",Archivos de cardiologia de Mexico,95,16

We aimed to develop a model for respiratory depressant effects of propofol with remifentanil in patients undergoing endoscopy with sedation. Data were available for 136 patients undergoing endoscopy with sedation. Participants randomly received infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Predicted plasma concentrations, outputted by infusion pumps, were available. Transcutaneous arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) was measured. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods. Covariate relationships were investigated for age, noxious stimuli (endoscopy tube insertion), and A118G genotype for the µ-opioid receptor (OPRM1). Participants had a median (range) age of 64.0 (25.0-88.0) years, weight of 70.0 (35.0-98.0) kg, and height of 164.0 (147.0-190.0) cm. Seven percent were recessive homozygous for OPRM1 polymorphism. An indirect-effect model with a ""modulator"" compartment best described pCO2 data (P < 0.001) over a direct-effect model. Remifentanil inhibited pCO2 removal with an IC50 of 1.13 ng/ml and first-order rate constant (ke 0) of 0.28 minute(-1). Propofol affected the modulator compartment with an IC50 of 4.97 µg/ml (no effect-site compartment). Propofol IC50 and remifentanil ke 0 were reduced with increasing age. Noxious stimuli and genotype were not significant covariates. An indirect-effect model with a rebound mechanism can describe remifentanil- and propofol-induced changes in pCO2 in patients undergoing noxious procedures. The model may be useful for identifying optimal dosing schedules for these drugs in a combination that provides adequate sedation but avoids respiratory depression.","Hannam, Jacqueline A; Borrat, Xavier; Trocóniz, Iñaki F; Valencia, José F; Jensen, Erik W; Pedroso, Angela; Muñoz, Jenifer; Castellví-Bel, Sergi; Castells, Antoni; Gambús, Pedro L",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,95,1

METHOD A total of 13 MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) facilities were sent a survey questionnaire to request information on their current practice with the use of GBCAs. RESULTS Gadodiamide, a high risk GBCA accounted for 67% of first line agents. 5 (42%) had a departmental protocol on the administration of GBCAs with regards to its association with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Of the 8 that use gadodiamide, 3 check kidney function in all patients, 2 check in selected patients, and 3 do not check at all. All 3 that screen all patients do not use contrast if the patient has an eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) of 30-59 ml/min, 1 considers other modality; and if the patient has an eGFR of <30 ml/min, 2 do not use contrast but consider other modality, however 1 continues with the high risk agent. CONCLUSION Gadodiamide is widely used, with varied practice in screening for renal function, and risk factors associated with NSF. Current evidence shows that it is advisable to administer macrocyclic agents in patients with compromised renal function. It is also imperative to establish local guidelines in line with international guidelines in order to minimize the incidence of NSF.","Piersson, A D; Gorleku, P N",Radiography,95,24

We developed a novel method of direct access into the space of Retzius with a visual obturator port (VisiportTM) for laparoscopic or robotic prostatectomy. We present an instructional video of extraperitoneal pelvic access for eRARP with both internal and external camera views. The patient is first placed in lithotomy and 15° Trendelenburg position. The camera is inserted infraumbilically and angled caudally. The pre-peritoneal space is accessed through the anterior rectus fascia using a VisiportTM (Covidien, $ 60 www.esutures.com), and the working space is developed with a kidney - shaped balloon OMSPDBS2TM (Covidien, $ 49 www.esutures.com). After the space is insufflated, subsequent trocars are angled in extraperitoneally under direct vision. The average time from incision to final port placement after a learning curve of about 50 cases is 8 minutes (IQR 7-10). We have performed over 1.000 cases using this technique and eRARP has become our procedure of choice. Our last 500 + cases were performed robotically. Approximately 10% of the time peritoneotomies were noted, but rarely did these require conversion to tRARP.

Participants were 1175 children of the population-based birth cohort Generation XXI, who provided food diaries and complete data on socio-demographic variables, anthropometric measures, and the Portuguese Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (P-CEBQ). Foods were grouped according to NOVA classification into: ""unprocessed, minimally or moderately processed, and culinary preparations""; ""processed""; ""ultra-processed"". To assess tracking of groups' consumption, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Generalized linear models were fitted to test main associations, mediators, and interactions among the variables. Ultra-processed consumption exhibited a fair level of stability between ages 4 and 7 (r=0.34; ICC=0.32; 95%CI: 0.25; 0.39), corresponding respectively to 27.3% (449.8 kcal per day; SD=217.2) and 29.3% (526.9 kcal per day; SD=229.7) of total energy intake. After adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher ultra-processed consumption at 4 years was associated directly with 'Food Responsiveness' (β̂ = 0.019; 95%CI: 0.007; 0.037), and indirectly through energy intake with avoidant traits: 'Food Fussiness' (β̂ = -0.007; 95% CI: 0.002; 0.012) and 'Satiety Responsiveness' (β̂ = -0.007; 95% CI: 0.003; 0.012). Ultra-processed consumption at 4 years old was associated with BMI at 10 years old, but appetitive behaviours were not powerful mediators of this association. The results suggest a path by which ultra-processed products may impact on later appetitive traits and higher BMI in children.","Vedovato, Gabriela Milhassi; Vilela, Sofia; Severo, Milton; Rodrigues, Sara; Lopes, Carla; Oliveira, Andreia",The British journal of nutrition,95,1

With growing interest in enhancing resilience in physicians, given their high risk for experiencing prolonged or intense stress, effective strategies are necessary to improve resilience and reduce negative outcomes including burnout. The objective of this review was to identify effective interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training, working in any setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), and observational studies (including pilot studies) published in English, French, and Spanish that included an intervention to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. We included studies that implemented interventions to reduce burnout, anxiety, and depression or to improve empathy to ultimately enhance resilience, rather than studies designed solely to reduce stress or trauma-induced stress. We performed a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane Library with no publication year limit. The last search was conducted on March 29, 2017. We used random effect models to calculate pooled standardized mean differences. Resilience was the primary outcome measure using validated resilience scores. Secondary outcome measures included proxy measures of resilience such as burnout, empathy, anxiety and depression. Our search strategy identified 7,579 records;74 met the criteria for full-text review. Seventeen studies were included in the final review published between 1998 and 2016 of which 9 (4 RCT, 5 observational) had physician data extractable. Interventions varied greatly regarding their approach, duration, and follow-up. Two RCTs measured resilience using validated scales; both found a significant improvement. No meta-analysis for resilience was conducted due to the presence of high clinical and methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review demonstrates that there is weak evidence to support one intervention over another to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from very low to low. There is a need for a consensus on the definition of resilience and how it is measured. Longer follow-up is required to ensure any intervention effects are sustained over time.","Venegas, Carolina Lavin; Nkangu, Miriam N; Duffy, Melissa C; Fergusson, Dean A; Spilg, Edward G",PloS one,95,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was conducted of 46 consecutive patients (31 men and 15 women; mean age, 64 y) treated with CT-guided microwave ablation for hepatic-dome tumors between June 2011 and December 2014. Baseline demographics of sex, tumor diagnosis, tumor location, tumor size, and technical details were recorded. Technical success was evaluated. Treatment response was assessed per European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Overall success and overall survival were calculated, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Forty-eight tumors were treated. Tumor locations included segments VIII (n = 32), VII (n = 10), and VIa (n = 6). Mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 0.9-5.2 cm). Thirty-four tumors (70%) were treated following creation of artificial ascites with 0.9% normal saline solution (mean volume, 1,237 mL; range, 300-3,000 mL). The technical success rate was 100%, and the complete response rate was 94%. Overall survival rate was 73.9% over 24.7 months of follow-up. There were no major complications. Two patients experienced small, asymptomatic pneumothoraces that were aspirated at the time of the procedure and required no further treatment. CONCLUSIONS CT-guided microwave ablation of tumors in the hepatic dome is associated with a high technical success rate, high complete response rate, and low complication rate.","Asvadi, Nazanin H; Anvari, Arash; Uppot, Raul N; Thabet, Ashraf; Zhu, Andrew X; Arellano, Ronald S",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,95,1

METHODS A population pharmacokinetic model for capecitabine and its three metabolites was built. Typical parameter values, characteristics of random distributions, associated with parameters, and covariates impact were estimated. Area under the curve (AUC) were computed for 5-FU and compared with grades of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic modeling was based on data collected on the first treatment cycle. Toxicity was assessed on the two first treatment cycles. RESULTS The study was conducted in 43 patients. The population pharmacokinetic model (a one-compartment model per compound) was able to capture the very complex absorption process of capecitabine. Statistically significant covariates were cytidine deaminase, alkaline phosphatase and dihydrouracilemia (UH2)/uracilemia (U) ratio. UH2/U ratio was the most significant covariate on 5-FU elimination and CDA on the transformation of 5'-DFCR in 5'-DFUR. A trend was observed between 5-FU AUC and thrombopenia toxicity grades, but not with other toxicities. Best clinical response was not linked to systemic exposure of capecitabine metabolites. CONCLUSION In our study, we propose a model able to describe, meanwhile, and its main metabolites, with a complex absorption process and inclusion of enzyme activity covariates such as CDA and UH2/U ratio.

NMR diffusometry with chemical resolution is used to identify unexpected loading- and composition-dependent anomalous diffusion in water/cyclohexane mixtures confined to solid nanoporous glass (NPG) hosts. Diffusion NMR results indicate that data obtained on pure-component liquids in confinement cannot be extrapolated to their nonideal liquid mixtures confined in the same solid host. Loading-dependent data must be obtained on each component in the confined mixture in order to determine which of the liquid components exhibits chemical affinity for the host and, conversely, which of the components exhibits anomalous diffusivity. Most notably, NMR diffusometry revealed that cyclohexane diffusivity varied by 2 orders of magnitude in a water-rich mixture depending on the total fluid loading in the NPG host, ranging from anomalously high diffusivities that significantly exceeded that for pure cyclohexane in NPG at low fluid loadings to kinetically trapped sequestration at high fluid loadings. NMR diffusometry indicates that nonideal solution behavior in fluids confined within nanoporous hosts may have practical implications for enhanced oil recovery methods. Specifically, kinetic trapping of hydrocarbons in water-flooding regimes can result from complex liquid-vapor equilibrium that is significantly perturbed from that which exists in bulk or microporous confinement.","Erfani, Amir; Szutkowski, Kosma; Aichele, Clint P; White, Jeffery L",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,95,9

A total of 182 consecutive patients scheduled for open thyroidectomy were prospectively randomised into two similarly sized groups. The parameters of operative time, morbidity, incision length, postoperative pain and hospital stay were analysed. RESULTS The main clinically primary endpoints of the two devices were identical in the study as the rate of nerve lesions, bleeding, drainage, operative time and postoperative calcium concentration with no significant differences with respect to the instrument utilised. The mean length of the incision was greater in the F group (p < 0.05). Patients in the F group were more likely to complain of pain while swallowing (p < 0.001). Early postoperative measurements of intact parathyroid hormone plasma levels revealed that although the levels were within the reference range, they were significantly lower in the F group (p < 0.001). Oral calcium supplementation was significantly higher and more prolonged in the F group.

However, the application of SSBs is impeded by uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and short circuiting, the mechanism of which remains elusive. Herein, we conceptualize a scheme to visualize Li deposition in the confined space inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to mimic Li deposition dynamics inside solid electrolyte (SE) cracks, where the high-strength CNT walls mimic the mechanically strong SEs. We observed that the deposited Li propagates as a creeping solid in the CNTs, presenting an effective pathway for stress relaxation. When the stress-relaxation pathway is blocked, the Li deposition-induced stress reaches the gigapascal level and causes CNT fracture. Mechanics analysis suggests that interfacial lithiophilicity critically governs Li deposition dynamics and stress relaxation. Our study offers critical strategies for suppressing Li dendritic growth and constructing high-energy-density, electrochemically and mechanically robust SSBs.","Chen, Jingzhao; Zhao, Chao; Xue, Dingchuan; Zhang, Liqiang; Yang, Tingting; Du, Congcong; Zhang, Xuedong; Fang, Ruyue; Guo, Baiyu; Ye, Hongjun; Li, Hui; Dai, Qiushi; Zhao, Jun; Li, Yanshuai; Harris, Stephen J; Tang, Yongfu; Ding, Feng; Zhang, Sulin; Huang, Jianyu",Nano letters,95,7

These robots assist first responders by performing tasks that are impractical or impossible for humans. Unfortunately, current disaster robots usually lack the maneuverability to efficiently traverse these areas, which often necessitate extreme navigational capabilities, such as centimeter-scale clearance. Recent work has shown that it is possible to control the locomotion of insects such as the Madagascar hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) through bioelectrical stimulation of their neuro-mechanical system. This provides access to a novel agent that can traverse areas that are inaccessible to traditional robots. In this paper, we present a data-driven inertial navigation system that is capable of localizing cockroaches in areas where GPS is not available. We pose the navigation problem as a two-point boundary-value problem where the goal is to reconstruct a cockroach's trajectory between the starting and ending states, which are assumed to be known. We validated our technique using nine trials that were conducted in a circular arena using a biobotic agent equipped with a thorax-mounted, low-cost inertial measurement unit.

Coincident with the rapid developments of COVID-19 vaccines globally, concerns about the safety of such a vaccine could contribute to vaccine hesitancy. We analyzed 1941 anonymous questionnaires completed by healthcare workers and members of the general Israeli population, regarding acceptance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. Our results indicate that healthcare staff involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients, and individuals considering themselves at risk of disease, were more likely to self-report acquiescence to COVID-19 vaccination if and when available. In contrast, parents, nurses, and medical workers not caring for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients expressed higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. Interventional educational campaigns targeted towards populations at risk of vaccine hesitancy are therefore urgently needed to combat misinformation and avoid low inoculation rates.","Dror, Amiel A; Eisenbach, Netanel; Taiber, Shahar; Morozov, Nicole G; Mizrachi, Matti; Zigron, Asaf; Srouji, Samer; Sela, Eyal",European journal of epidemiology,95,1

During this developmental period, social media use is also emerging as a dominant mode of communication with peers, allowing for both risk and resilient behaviors that can impact well-being. OBJECTIVE This exploratory study aims to examine how sexual minorities in middle school use social media, who they are connected to and for what purposes, and the associations between these behaviors and mental well-being compared with their heterosexual peers. METHODS In our cross-sectional survey study of 1033 early adolescents aged between 10 and 16 years (average age 12.7, SD 1.21 years) from 4 middle school sites in the Northeastern United States, we conducted an exploratory study comparing sexual minorities (212/873, 24.3% of sample with known sexual orientation) with their heterosexual peers (n=661), obtaining an 84.46% (1033/1223; total possible) response rate. RESULTS Sexual minorities reported having smaller networks on their favorite social media website (β=-.57; P<.001), less often responded positively when friends shared good news (β=-.35; P=.002), and less often tried to make friends feel better when they shared bad news (β=-.30; P=.01). However, sexual minorities more often reported joining a group or web-based community to make themselves feel less alone (β=.28; P=.003), unlike heterosexual youth. Sexual minorities had higher averages of loneliness and social isolation (β=.19; P<.001) than heterosexual students. Sexual minorities were also twice as likely to have tried to harm themselves in the past (β=.81; odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% CI 1.64-3.06; P<.001) and were more likely to have symptoms that reached the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression definition of depression (β=.15; OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.25; P<.001). About 39.1% (83/212) of sexual minorities had no one to talk to about their sexual orientation. Sexual minorities were 1.5 times more likely to have joined a social media website their parents would disapprove (β=.41; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14-1.97; P=.004) and more likely to report seeing videos related to self-harm (β=.33; OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06-1.83; P=.02) on the web than heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS Given previous reports of supportive and safe web-based spaces for sexual minority youth, our findings demonstrated that sexual minority youth prefer to maintain small, close-knit web-based communities (apart from their families) to express themselves, particularly when reaching out to web-based communities to reduce loneliness. Future longitudinal studies could determine any bidirectional influences of mental well-being and social media use in sexual minorities during this difficult developmental period.","Charmaraman, Linda; Hodes, Rachel; Richer, Amanda M",JMIR mental health,95,27

However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. METHODS A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.72). Severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly more prevalent when there was higher urbanization plus lower neighborhood deprivation (PR = 1.34 [1.15-1.56], and 1.57 [1.22-2.03], respectively). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that it is not the number of COVID-19 cases by residence area but higher urbanization level and greater neighborhood deprivation (lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status) that are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic. These findings differ in part from evidence obtained before the pandemic.","Okubo, Ryo; Yoshioka, Takashi; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Okano, Hiroki; Ikezawa, Satoru; Tsuno, Kanami; Murayama, Hiroshi; Tabuchi, Takahiro",Journal of affective disorders,95,1

An easy-to-use index capable of the early identification of inpatients who are at risk of becoming critically ill is urgently needed in clinical practice. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore an easy-to-use nomogram and a model to triage patients into risk categories to determine the likelihood of developing a critical illness. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted. We extracted data from 84 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from one designated hospital. The primary endpoint was the development of severe/critical illness within 7 days after admission. Predictive factors of this endpoint were selected by LASSO Cox regression model. A nomogram was developed based on selected variables. The predictive performance of the derived nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves and decision curves. Additionally, the predictive performances of individual and combined variables under study were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. The developed model was also tested in a separate validation set with 71 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results None of the 84 inpatients were lost to follow-up in this retrospective study. The primary endpoint occurred in 23 inpatients (27.4%). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were selected as the final prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed based on the NLR and CRP. The calibration curve and decision curve indicated that the constructed nomogram model was clinically useful. The AUCs for the NLR, CRP and Combined Index in both training set and validation sets were 0.685 (95% CI: 0.574-0.783), 0.764 (95% CI: 0.659-0.850), 0.804 (95% CI: 0.702-0.883), and 0.881 (95% CI: 0.782-0.946), respectively. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the nomogram and Combined Index calculated from the NLR and CRP are potential and reliable predictors of COVID-19 prognosis and can triage patients at the time of admission.","Liu, Yue-Ping; Li, Gao-Ming; He, Jun; Liu, Ying; Li, Min; Zhang, Rui; Li, Ya-Lan; Wu, Ya-Zhou; Diao, Bo",Annals of translational medicine,95,1

Mechanical forces are implicated in the progression of emphysema that is a major pathologic feature of COPD. We hypothesized that resistive breathing exacerbates emphysema. Methods C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.75 units of pancreatic porcine elastase intratracheally to develop emphysema. Resistive breathing was applied by suturing a nylon band around the trachea to reduce surface area to half for the last 24 or 72 hours of a 21-day time period after elastase treatment in total. Following RB (24 or 72 hours), lung mechanics were measured and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Emphysema was quantified by the mean linear intercept (Lm) and the destructive index (DI) in lung tissue sections. Results Following 21 days of intratracheal elastase exposure, Lm and DI increased in lung tissue sections [Lm (μm), control 39.09±0.76, elastase 62.05±2.19, p=0.003 and DI, ctr 30.95±2.75, elastase 73.12±1.75, p<0.001]. RB for 72 hours further increased Lm by 64% and DI by 19%, compared to elastase alone (p<0.001 and p=0.02, respectively). RB induced BAL neutrophilia in elastase-treated mice. Static compliance (Cst) increased in elastase-treated mice [Cst (mL/cmH2O), control 0.067±0.001, elastase 0.109±0.006, p<0.001], but superimposed RB decreased Cst, compared to elastase alone [Cst (mL/cmH2O), elastase+RB24h 0.090±0.004, p=0.006 to elastase, elastase+RB72h 0.090±0.005, p=0.006 to elastase]. Conclusion Resistive breathing augments pulmonary inflammation and emphysema in an elastase-induced emphysema mouse model.","Toumpanakis, Dimitrios; Mizi, Eleftheria; Vassilakopoulou, Vyronia; Dettoraki, Maria; Chatzianastasiou, Athanasia; Perlikos, Fotis; Giatra, Georgia; Moscholaki, Marina; Theocharis, Stamatios; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,95,24

In some cases, however, its value is not absolute and autonomy may be overridden by sufficiently important matters of public interest. Coroner's autopsies represent an example of when the wishes of the deceased and their family may come in conflict with the benefits of knowledge gained from understanding the cause of death. Current legislation governing coroner's autopsies relies on the assumption of their obvious public benefit, hence consent for them need not be sought. This interpretation has attracted controversy, as exemplified by the case of Rotsztein vs HM Senior Coroner and a recent study questioning the prevalent use of invasive autopsy. However, this issue has received little recent attention in ethical literature. In this essay, the ethical nature of coroner's autopsies in cases of natural deaths with unexplained causes is examined as a balance between patient autonomy and the value of knowledge gained from them. This is done by analysing a case which under current legislation warrants coroner's autopsy, however, its ethical justification remains contentious. This discussion is expanded by discussion of non-invasive alternatives and comparison to another situation which balances individual autonomy with public benefits-organ donation. The conclusion of this analysis is a moral middle ground in which objection to invasive autopsy could be respected once issues of overriding public interest are excluded, or at least non-invasive alternatives should be considered, with coroners left responsible for demonstrating specific public needs that could override objection.","Szeligowski, Tomasz",Journal of medical ethics,95,31

MATERIAL AND METHOD In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (Bærum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital. Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3). Only one of the most severely ill patients scored ≥ 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission. INTERPRETATION Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms. A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness. A NEWS2 score of ≥ 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score ≥ 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.","Ihle-Hansen, Håkon; Berge, Trygve; Tveita, Anders; Rønning, Else Johanne; Ernø, Per Erik; Andersen, Elizabeth Lyster; Wang, Christian Hjorth; Tveit, Arnljot; Myrstad, Marius","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",95,16

WBAN originates from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are used for implementing many healthcare systems integrated with networks and wireless devices to ensure remote healthcare monitoring. WBAN is a network of wearable devices implanted in or on the human body. The main aim of WBAN is to collect the human vital signs/physiological data (like ECG, body temperature, EMG, glucose level, etc.) round-the-clock from patients that demand secure, optimal and efficient routing techniques. The efficient, secure, and reliable designing of routing protocol is a difficult task in WBAN due to its diverse characteristic and restraints, such as energy consumption and temperature-rise of implanted sensors. The two significant constraints, overheating of nodes and energy efficiency must be taken into account while designing a reliable blockchain-enabled WBAN routing protocol. The purpose of this study is to achieve stability and efficiency in the routing of WBAN through managing temperature and energy limitations. Moreover, the blockchain provides security, transparency, and lightweight solution for the interoperability of physiological data with other medical personnel in the healthcare ecosystem. In this research work, the blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR) protocol for WBAN is proposed. Temperature rise, energy consumption, and throughput are the evaluation metrics considered to analyze the performance of ATEAR for data transmission. In contrast, transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization are used to investigate the outcome of the blockchain system. Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the blockchain system in terms of CPU utilization, memory, and memory utilization. The results show that by preserving residual energy and avoiding overheated nodes as forwarders, high throughput is achieved with the ultimate increase of the network lifetime. Castalia, a simulation tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, and its comparison is made with Multipath Ring Routing Protocol (MRRP), thermal-aware routing algorithm (TARA), and Shortest-Hop (SHR). Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed protocol performs significantly better in balancing of temperature (to avoid damaging heat effect on the body tissues) and energy consumption (to prevent the replacement of battery and to increase the embedded sensor node life) with efficient data transmission achieving a high throughput value.","Shahbazi, Zeinab; Byun, Yung-Cheol",Sensors,95,17

Among the 17 recognized members of the family, the human enzyme PARP1 is the most extensively studied, resulting in a number of known biological and metabolic roles. This review is focused on the roles played by PARP enzymes in host-pathogen interactions and in diseases with an associated inflammatory response. In mammalian cells, several PARPs have specific roles in the antiviral response; this is perhaps best illustrated by PARP13, also termed the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Plant stress responses and immunity are also regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARPs promote inflammatory responses by stimulating proinflammatory signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Hence, PARP inhibitors show promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions with an inflammatory component, such as diabetes, arthritis, and stroke. These functions are correlated with the biophysical characteristics of PARP family enzymes. This work is important in providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis and host responses, as well as in the identification of inhibitors. This is important because the identification of inhibitors has been shown to be effective in arresting the progression of disease.","Brady, Pamlea N; Goel, Anupam; Johnson, Margaret A",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,95,1

INTRODUCTION During the Covid-19 outbreak, the health care institutions and the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) have been reorganized with significant consequences at both organizational and clinical levels. AIMS To investigate (1) the organizational changes of hospitals and ICUs in dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak; (2) the characteristics of the nursing care; (3) the most important challenges perceived by nurses in caring for Covid-19 patients. METHODS Cross-sectional online survey, available from May 11th and July 10th, 2020. Participants were nurses caring for Covid-19 patients in European ICUs. RESULTS A total of 62 nurses responded to the survey; average age 37.5 years, 31 (60.8%) were female, mostly from Italy, France and United Kingdom. All hospitals underwent many changes, such as the opening of new dedicated wards and the restriction of family visits. The number of ICU beds doubled during the pandemic (p<0.01), as well as the number of nurses per shift from 10.2 (SD 7.3) before to 17.9 (SD 13.6) during the pandemic (p<0.01). However, changes in the nurse-to-patient ratio were not significant: from 1:1.5 to 1:2 (p=0.05). Among nursing care activities, clinical risk management (n=14, 22.6%), psychological support for patients (n=22, 35.5%) and family's involvement (n=31, 50%) resulted as more challenging; 64.5% of nurses suffered from protective equipment shortages, and 66.1% experienced psychological burden. CONCLUSION These findings can help to reflect on how to better prepare both nurses and health care institutions for other events that may threaten clinical practice and require major and innovative efforts.","Danielis, Matteo; Palese, Alvisa; Terzoni, Stefano; Destrebecq, Anne Lucia Leona",Assistenza infermieristica e ricerca : AIR,95,24

We conducted searches in the special L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in databases, trial registries, preprint servers and websites relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included three randomized trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large increase in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is impossible to balance potential benefits, if there are any, with the adverse effects and costs.

In this work, we explored the function of miR-29b in cerebral ischemia. The level of miR-29b in white blood cells was evaluated in patients and mice after ischemic stroke. Brain infarct volume and National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) scores were analyzed to determine the relationship between miR-29b expression and the severity of stroke. The relationship of miR-29b and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was further studied in mice. We found that miR-29b was significantly downregulated in stroke patients (P<0.05). MiR-29b level negatively associated with NIHSS scores (r=-0.349, P<0.01) and brain infarct volume (r=-0.321, P<0.05). In ischemic mice, miR-29b in the brain and blood were both downregulated (r=0.723, P<0.05). MiR-29b overexpression reduced infarct volume (49.50±6.55 versus 35.48±2.28 mm(3), P<0.05), edema (164±4% versus 108±4%, P<0.05), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption compared with controls (15±9% versus 7±3%, P<0.05). Aquaporin-4 expression greatly decreased after miR-29b overexpression (28±7% versus 11±3%, P<0.05). Dual-luciferase reporter system showed that AQP-4 was the direct target of miR-29b (P<0.05). We concluded that miR-29b could potentially predict stroke outcomes as a novel circulating biomarker, and miR-29b overexpression reduced BBB disruption after ischemic stroke via downregulating AQP-4.","Wang, Yang; Huang, Jun; Ma, Yuanyuan; Tang, Guanghui; Liu, Yanqun; Chen, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Zhijun; Zeng, Lili; Wang, Yongting; Ouyang, Yi-Bing; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,95,1

This study aimed to identify parameters in routine blood tests that could be used to evaluate the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and, thus, assist with the clinical prediction of the extent of progression. Methods This retrospective study analyzed the epidemiological, clinical symptom, and laboratory examination data of 159 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The percentage of lymphocytes (Lym%) and hemoglobin (HGB) were integrated into a joint parameter, Lym% & HGB, through binary logistic regression. Results Individually, Lym% and HGB decreased gradually with disease progression whereas the joint parameter Lym% & HGB increased gradually with disease progression. When Lym%, HGB, and Lym% & HGB were used to predict the severity of COVID-19, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.89, 0.79, and 0.92, respectively. The dynamic change curves showed that Lym% and HGB continued to decline while Lym% & HGB continued to increase with disease progression in patients with severe COVID. The change in Lym% & HGB was more prominent than those in Lym% and HBG. Conclusions The joint parameter Lym% & HGB could serve as an effective tool for differentiating severe and nonsevere COVID-19, and its sensitivity and specificity are higher than those of Lym% or HGB alone.","Zhang, Wenping; Zhang, Zhongming; Ye, Yi; Luo, Yanting; Pan, Shiyao; Qi, Huan; Yu, Zhiyong; Qu, Jiuxin",Annals of translational medicine,95,1

Methods A total of 16 patients (10 males, 6 females; mean age 75.6±4.7 years; range, 68 to 81 years) who underwent carotid artery stenting with an embolic protection device between January 2017 and February 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The sizing was based on intraprocedural angiography findings with the same brand stent using distal protection device. Pre-procedural computed tomography angiography images used for diagnosis were obtained and modeled with three-dimensional printing method. Pre-procedural and threedimensional data regarding the size of stents and protection devices and implantation sites were compared. Results Measurements obtained from three-dimensional models manually and segmentation images from software were found to be similar and both were smaller than actually used for stent and embolic protection device sizes. The rates of carotid artery stenosis were similar with manual and software methods, but were lower than the quantitative angiographic measurements. Device implantation sites detected by the manual and software methods were different than the actual setting. Conclusion The planning and practicing of procedure with threedimensional models may reduce the operator-dependent variables, shorten the operation time, decrease X-ray exposure, and increase the procedural success.","Göçer, Hakan; Durukan, Ahmet Barış; Tunç, Osman; Naseri, Erdinç; Ercan, Ertuğrul",Turk gogus kalp damar cerrahisi dergisi,95,1

Prior research has not reached a consensus on the impacts of parental out-migration on children's growth, and little is known about how community contexts modify the impact of parental out-migration. OBJECTIVE We aim to assess the overall impacts of fathers' previous and current migration experiences on children's nutritional status in India and how the impacts are shaped by community socioeconomic contexts and community gender norms. METHODS Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey collected in 2011-2012, we estimated community fixed-effect regression models predicting the nutritional status of children (ages 10-15) and examined the interactions among fathers' migration, child's gender, and community contexts. RESULTS The results showed that children of returned migrants had lower height and Body Mass Index (BMI) than children of non-migrants. Fathers' current absence was associated with lower height and BMI for adolescents in communities with high levels of socioeconomic development but not for those in communities with low levels of development. Fathers' current absence due to migration was especially harmful for girls in communities with strict norms of female seclusion. CONTRIBUTION Our findings highlight that the effects of father's out-migration on children are conditioned by the level of communities' socioeconomic development and community gender contexts, which helps to reconcile the previously mixed findings on the effects of parental migration on child outcomes.","Lei, Lei; Desai, Sonalde; Chen, Feinian",Demographic research,95,1

High levels of social connection are positively associated with beneficial health outcomes, while social isolation is associated with poor long-term health outcomes including reduced life expectancy. The present study evaluates the impact of social distancing measures during the early period of COVID-19 on substance use behaviors among those in the United States. Methods: We used an internet-based survey with participants (n = 157; 86 male) reporting a history of problems related to drug use. We relied on ANOVA and logistic regression techniques to assess the associations between social connection and substance use. Results: People with more severe drug use problems reported feeling more socially isolated during social distancing. Those who primarily use alcohol reported higher global feelings of social connection than those who primarily use opioids. During social distancing, participants reported an increase in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and a decrease in cocaine use. Lastly, those who reported using drugs for social reasons were less likely to have decreased substance use during social distancing. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that social distancing guidelines have impacted both substance use behaviors and feelings of social and physical connection. Further, there are differential impacts based on drug of choice. These results advance delineation of the connection between sociality and drug use.","Christie, Nina C; Vojvodic, Vanya; Monterosso, John R",Substance use & misuse,95,1

Here, I use semistructured interviews of employees at two field sites, in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda and Loango National Park, Gabon, to understand if their employment influenced their attitude towards gorillas and conservation and led to behavior change. In contrast to western views of gorillas as ""gentle giants,"" staff viewed gorillas as dangerous animals before working for these projects. Overall, employment leads to viewing conservation and gorillas more positively, and in many cases, viewing the gorillas as kin. The most common value attributed to the gorillas was economic, yet intrinsic and non-use existence values were frequently mentioned. Loango staff, but not Bwindi staff, reported behavior change related to hunting and bushmeat consumption, which likely is related to bushmeat consumption being commonplace in Gabon but not in Uganda. The Bwindi staff seemed to have a more positive and broader outlook toward conservation than the Loango staff, possibly because they had more years of formal education, they worked with gorillas longer, there is more history of conservation activities in Bwindi, and/or they have been less directly affected by negative consequences of conservation (e.g., crop raiding). This study shows the importance of explaining that gorillas are not dangerous if not provoked and using their human-like characteristics as a means to change conservation values and interest of local communities, while concurrently recognizing that providing economic benefits and reducing negative effects of wildlife are a reality for conservation buy-in.","Robbins, Martha M",American journal of primatology,95,19

Evidence suggests that the biosynthesis of indigo alkaloids in plants occurs via the shikimate pathway. The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) is involved in plant metabolism; however, its underlying putative mechanism of regulating the production of indigo alkaloids is currently unknown. RESULTS One gene encoding EPSPS was isolated from B. cusia. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that BcEPSPS was expressed at the highest level in the stem and upregulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The results of subcellular localization indicated that BcEPSPS is mainly expressed in both the plastids and cytosol, which has not been previously reported. An enzyme assay revealed that the heterogeneously expressed BcEPSPS protein catalysed the generation of 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate. The overexpression of BcEPSPS in Isatis indigotica hairy roots resulted in the high accumulation of indigo alkaloids, such as indigo, secologanin, indole and isorhamnetin. CONCLUSIONS The function of BcEPSPS in catalysing the production of EPSP and regulating indigo alkaloid biosynthesis was revealed, which provided a distinct view of plant metabolic engineering. Our findings have practical implications for understanding the effect of BcEPSPS on active compound biosynthesis in B. cusia.","Yu, Jian; Zhang, Yihan; Ning, Shuju; Ye, Qi; Tan, Hexin; Chen, Ruibing; Bu, Qitao; Zhang, Rui; Gong, Peimin; Ma, Xiaoli; Zhang, Lei; Wei, Daozhi",BMC plant biology,95,29

The transumbilical single port has proved to be an attractive and safe alternative for a variety of minimally invasive abdominal surgeries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the initial results of a group of patients operated by single-port sleeve gastrectomy compared with a group operated by conventional laparoscopic technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present a prospective cohort study of two groups of consecutive patients with body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 55 kg/m(2), with an indication of sleeve gastrectomy. In 20 patients, we used a transumbilical single-port (TUSP) technique; in 22 patients, we used the conventional laparoscopic (CL) technique. All surgeries were performed between June and December 2009 in the Gastrointestinal Surgery Department of Hospital Clínic, Barcelona. The same medical team, in a standardized fashion, carried out all surgeries. RESULTS There were no differences between groups in body mass index (BMI), age, sex, number and type of comorbidities, or history of previous abdominal surgery. Operative time (79.2 min) was significantly higher in the TUSP group (p = 0.002) than in the CL group (54.1 min). There were no conversions to open surgery in any of the patients operated upon via CL, but one conversion to laparoscopic surgery, requiring the addition of three trocars, in the TUSP group. There were no significant differences in morbidity or hospital stay between the groups. Percentage excess weight loss and excess BMI loss at 3 and 6 months, as indexes for improvement and resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity, showed that there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical single-port sleeve gastrectomy has proved to be safe, technically feasible, and reproducible, with results that are similar to those obtained with conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Delgado, Salvadora; Ibarzabal, Ainitze; Adelsdorfer, Cedric; Adelsdorfer, Waldemar; Corcelles, Ricard; Momblán, Dulce; Lacy, Antonio M",Surgical endoscopy,95,24

The authors aimed to compare these two C:V ratios in a neonatal swine model of cardiac arrest following asphyxia. DESIGN Experimental animal study. SETTING Facility for animal research. SUBJECTS 22 newborn pigs (age 12-36 h, weight 2.0-2.7 kg). INTERVENTIONS Progressive asphyxia until asystole. Animals were randomised to receive C:V 3:1 (n=11) or 15:2 (n=11). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as a heart rate ≥ 100 bpm. Also of interest were haemodynamic parameters, cerebral and systemic oxygen saturation and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). RESULTS Two animals in each group did not achieve ROSC. Mean (SD) increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP; mm Hg) during compression cycles was significantly higher at a C:V ratio of 15:2 than 3:1 (7.1 (2.8) vs 4.8 (2.6)). Median time (IQR) to ROSC for the 3:1 group was 150 (140-180) s, and 195 (145-358) s for the 15:2 group. There were no significant differences in the temporal changes in haemodynamic parameters or oxygen saturation indices between the groups. IL-1β levels in cerebrospinal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION In neonatal pigs with asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest, the response to a C:V ratio of 15:2 is not better than the response to a C:V ratio of 3:1 despite better generation of DBP during resuscitation.","Solevåg, Anne L; Dannevig, Ingrid; Wyckoff, Myra; Saugstad, Ola D; Nakstad, Britt",Archives of disease in childhood.

AZA treatment increased apoptosis and inhibited the Wnt signaling transduction pathway, angiogenesis, and cell metastatic capacity to a significantly higher extent in the 231Br line. AZA treatment in mice with experimental brain metastases significantly reduced tumor burden (P = .0112) and increased survival (P = .0026) compared to vehicle.

Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify changes in attendances at emergency healthcare. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","McDonnell, Thérèse; McAuliffe, Eilish; Barrett, Michael; Conlon, Ciara; Cummins, Fergal; Deasy, Conor; Hensey, Conor; Martin, Ciara; Nicholson, Emma",HRB open research,95,1

With our experimental workflow, electrophysiological and ""flash-and-freeze"" electron microscopy experiments can be performed under identical conditions in artificial cerebrospinal fluid alone, without the addition of external cryoprotectants, which are otherwise needed to allow adequate tissue preservation upon freezing.

Of the 1,700 healthcare providers approached, 433 completed questionnaires could be used. The results show that the pandemic has had a profound impact on both the accessibility of oral healthcare and on care provided in oral healthcare practices. Extra attention was paid to hygiene and infection prevention: the types of personal protective equipment and the protocols and procedures were adjusted by many oral healthcare providers. The confirmed prevalence of oral healthcare providers with COVID-19 in this study was 1.6%. However, testing was not available to all respondents with complaints during this initial period. Over half of the respondents estimated that even with additional measures there is an increased risk of infection to oral healthcare providers during their work. The efficacy of the various additional measures in oral healthcare practices related to COVID-19 is still unknown.","Persoon, I F; Volgenant, C M C; van der Veen, M H; Opdam, N J M; Manton, D J; Bruers, J J M",Nederlands tijdschrift voor tandheelkunde,95,1

Np is one of the most abundant structural proteins and it serves as a diagnostic marker for the accurate and sensitive detection of COVID-19. After five rounds of selection, we obtained four DNA sequences with an affinity below 5 nM. The best one displayed a superb binding performance toward Np with a Kd value of 0.49 nM. Interestingly, we found that the four pairs of aptamers could bind to Np successively, suggesting a sandwich-type interaction. Using these sandwiched aptamers in ELISA and colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips, we were able to detect Np at the tens of pM level. The results demonstrate that aptamers are powerful molecular tools for virus detection, diagnosis, and antiviral therapy.","Zhang, Liyun; Fang, Xiaona; Liu, Xingbo; Ou, Huichao; Zhang, Haiyan; Wang, Jinjun; Li, Qian; Cheng, Huanyi; Zhang, Wenyi; Luo, Zhaofeng",Chemical communications,95,1

Current studies have found that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a cell surface receptor of the novel coronavirus that plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is of immense importance for the prevention of virus transmission and treatment to clarify the distribution and expression of ACE2 in various tissues and organs of the body. Methods RNAseq transcriptome data and sex data were obtained from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. We separately analyzed the distribution of ACE2 expression in different tissues in the GTEx and TCGA database, and explored the correlation between sex and ACE2 expression levels. Next, the expression levels of ACE2 in different tissues and organs and its correlation with sex were analyzed once again after combing all samples from the two databases. Results ACE2 expression data were collected from the GTEx database for 6738 normal tissues. Six hundred eighteen tumor tissue data were collected from the TCGA database. The results of the analysis are consistent from different databases. The results indicated that the expression of ACE2 was the highest in the small intestines, higher in tissues such as salivary glands in the testicular, kidney, heart, thyroid and adipose tissues, while the expression of ACE2 was lower in tissues such as the spleen, brain, muscle, pituitary, and skin. There were no significant differences in the expression of ACE2 in the different organs when it came to the individual's sex. Conclusions Our study deeply explored the distribution and expression of ACE2 in various tissues of the human body. The tissues and organs with high ACE2 expression were consistent with the current clinical and basic research results of the novel coronavirus. Our study is conducive to the discovery of potential target organs for viral infection, to provide a reference for the development of clinical progress of patients with novel coronavirus infection.","Han, Tao; Kang, Jing; Li, Gao; Ge, Jing; Gu, Jia",Annals of translational medicine,95,1

The novel electrode is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional wet electrodes such as skin irritation, skin preparation, and conductive gel requirements. It is based on the conductive and stretchable Ag NWs/PDMS composite material and produced by 3D printing technology. Meanwhile, a portable reconfigurable 8-channel EEG acquisition system based on the analog front end ADS1299 is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional EEG acquisition system such as, large in size, difficult to configure, and complicated to use. It can be reconfigured by adjusting the gain of system and sampling rate. To verify the performance of proposed electrodes, a comprehensive test including electrode characterization and signal quality measurement is performed in comparison with Ag/AgCl electrode and Gold Cup electrode. Experiments reveal that proposed electrode achieves favorably results with wet electrodes. Furthermore, the proposed EEG acquisition system with novel dry electrodes is evaluated and compared with the commercial product. The evoked EEG signals (the steady-state visual evoked potentials, SSVEP) acquisition tasks of the proposed system are also conducted. Experimental results exhibit that proposed system satisfies the requirements of multi-channel EEG acquisition and provides a portable and comfortable way for EEG acquisition. With the high-quality sensing ability of the novel electrodes and the programmable gain amplifier of the proposed system, it can be expected to acquire the physiological signals like the electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) in the future.","Wang, Zeyu; Chen, Chen; Li, Wei; Yuan, Wei; Han, Tongmeng; Sun, Chenglu; Tao, Linkai; Zhao, Yuting; Chen, Wei",Conference proceedings : ...

However, the nature of spatial computations across streams is unknown. Using functional MRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping, we measured pRFs in face-selective regions. Results reveal that spatial computations by pRFs in ventral face-selective regions are concentrated around the center of gaze (fovea), but spatial computations in lateral face-selective regions extend peripherally. Diffusion MRI reveals that these differences are mirrored by a preponderance of white matter connections between ventral face-selective regions and foveal early visual cortex (EVC), while connections with lateral regions are distributed more uniformly across EVC eccentricities. These findings suggest a rethinking of spatial computations in face-selective regions, showing that they vary across ventral and lateral streams, and further propose that spatial computations in high-level regions are scaffolded by the fine-grain pattern of white matter connections from EVC.","Finzi, Dawn; Gomez, Jesse; Nordt, Marisa; Rezai, Alex A; Poltoratski, Sonia; Grill-Spector, Kalanit",Nature communications,95,16

Recent progress with antioxidant enzyme inhibitors shows promise, but mortality rates are high. We modified the dosage and administration of an antioxidant enzyme inhibitor regimen to reduce mortality while inducing a chronic wound environment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To chemically induce a chronic wound environment, we applied modified doses of catalase (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; intraperitoneal 0.5 g/kg) and glutathione peroxidase (mercaptosuccinic acid; topical 300 mg/kg) inhibitors to the dorsal wounds of 11-week-old db/db mice. A cohort of these mice was treated with a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold. Both groups were compared with Diabetic control mice. RESULTS This study successfully induced a chronic wound in 11-week-old db/db mice, with no animal deaths. The antioxidant enzyme treated groups showed delayed wound contraction and significantly higher levels of inflammatory tissue, collagen deposition, cellular proliferation and leukocyte infiltration than the Diabetic control group. Angiogenesis was significantly higher in the antioxidant enzyme treated groups, but the vessels were immature and friable. Scaffold engraftment was poor but appeared to promote blood vessel maturation. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the two in vivo groups treated with the antioxidant enzyme inhibitors appeared to be arrested in the inflammatory stage of wound healing, while the Diabetic control group progressed to the maturation phase and ultimately remodeling. This model may be instrumental for the development of new wound therapeutics.","Panayi, Adriana C; Endo, Yori; Karvar, Mehran; Sensharma, Prerana; Haug, Valentin; Fu, Siqi; Mi, Bobin; An, Yang; Orgill, Dennis P",BMJ open diabetes research & care,95,6

In our institution, laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is offered to patients with high-grade internal prolapse and fecal incontinence. OBJECTIVE The present study was designed to evaluate the functional outcome after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy in patients with fecal incontinence associated with high-grade internal rectal prolapse. DESIGN This study was designed as a prospective observational study. SETTINGS The study took place in a university hospital. PATIENTS Between 2009 and 2011, 72 patients with fecal incontinence not responding to maximum medical treatment (including biofeedback) were included. All patients had a grade III or grade IV rectal prolapse. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preoperative endoanal ultrasonography and anorectal manometry were performed. Fecal continence was evaluated by using the Rockwood Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score before and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS The median fecal incontinence severity index score 1 year after surgery was lower than the median score before surgery (15 versus 31; p < 0.01), representing an improvement in fecal continence. LIMITATIONS This was a preliminary observational study with no control group, no postoperative proctography, and no postoperative anal physiology. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy can improve symptoms of fecal incontinence in patients with a high-grade internal rectal prolapse. Internal rectal prolapse contributes to the multifactorial origin of fecal incontinence.","Gosselink, Martijn P; Adusumilli, S; Gorissen, Kim J; Fourie, Simona; Tuynman, Jurriaan B; Jones, Oliver M; Cunningham, Chris; Lindsey, Ian",Diseases of the colon and rectum,95,13

METHODS Preoperative blood samples were prospectively and consecutivelyanalyzed from 472 patients treated with RP for clinically localized prostate cancerat four medical centers. Measured parameters were PSA, free PSA (fPSA), fPSA/PSA ratio, [- 2] proPSA (p2PSA), p2PSA/fPSA ratio and Prostate Health Index (PHI)(p2PSA/fPSA)*√PSA]. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the accuracy of markers for prediction of pathological Gleason score (GS) ≥7, Gleason score upgrading, extracapsular extension of the tumor (pT3) and the presence of positive surgical margin (PSM). The accuracy of predictive models was compared using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS Of 472 patients undergoing RP, 339 (72%) were found to have pathologic GS ≥ 7, out of them 178 (53%) experienced an upgrade from their preoperative GS = 6. The findings of pT3 and PSM were present in 132 (28%) and 133 (28%) cases, respectively. At univariable analysis of all the preoperative parameters, PHI was the most accurate predictor of pathological GS ≥7 (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p<0.001), GS upgrading (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p<0.003), pT3 disease (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p<0.007) and the presence of PSM (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p<0.002). Adding of PHI into the base multivariable model increased significantly the accuracy for prediction of pathological GS by 4.4% to AUC = 66.6 (p = 0.015) and GS upgrading by 5.0% to AUC = 65.9 (p = 0.025), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative PHI levels may contribute significantly to prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness and expansion of the tumor detected at final pathology.","Novak, Vojtech; Vesely, Stepan; Luksanová, Hana; Prusa, Richard; Capoun, Otakar; Fiala, Vojtech; Dolejsová, Olga; Sedlacková, Hana; Kucera, Radek; Stejskal, Jiri; Zalesky, Miroslav; Babjuk, Marko",BMC urology,95,31

Depression is a common mental health problem that deteriorates the quality of life of people with HIV/AIDS and found to be a strong predictor for noncompliance to antiretroviral therapy treatment. Therefore, epidemiological evidence on the factors associated with depression among patients with HIV/AIDS can contribute towards effective and efficient preventive health care strategies for this population. Objectives To assess the prevalence and factors associated with depression among HIV/AIDS-infected patients attending ART clinic at Jimma University Medical Center, Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia, in 2018. Methods This study followed an institution-based cross-sectional quantitative study design. A simple random sampling method yielded 303 participants who were interviewed from April to May 2018, using a pretested questionnaire, followed by their card review. The SPSS version 23 was used for bivariate analysis which was used to find out the significance of association. Variables that showed association in bivariate analysis at p value < 0.25 were entered to multivariable logistic regressions to control for confounders, and the significance of association was determined by 95% confidence interval and p value < 0.05. Results The point prevalence of depression was 94 (31%). Variables like sex (AOR = 0.510 (95%CI = 0.264-0.986)), marital status (AOR = 3.610 (95%CI = 1.649-7.901)), opportunistic infection (AOR = 3.122 (95%CI = 1.700-5.733)), and medication adherence (AOR = 0.470 (95%CI = 0.266-0.831)) were significantly associated with depression. Conclusion and Recommendation. From the findings of this study, it is possible to conclude that depression was highly prevalent among people living with HIV/ADS. Sex, marital status, opportunistic infection, and medication adherence were found to be associated with depression and need attention from the health professional working in the ART clinic.","Dorsisa, Beyene; Ahimed, Gutema; Anand, Susan; Bekela, Tariku",Psychiatry journal,95,19

As disease protection during the first six months of life is provided via placental transfer of maternal antibodies, a maternal GBS vaccine may provide an effective strategy to reduce infectious death and disability. An efficacy study may be difficult because of the large sample size required and alternative approaches such as serocorrelates of protection based on natural antibody concentration are being considered. Such studies would need to be undertaken in high burden settings such as Uganda. We therefore aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a GBS sero-epidemiology study in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: This is a prospective cohort and nested case-control study, conducted across two-centres with two entry points. A) consecutive women and their infants at birth, with collection of maternal swab, cord and maternal blood, and follow up by telephone until the infant is 3 months old; B) any infant under 3 months of age, presenting with signs of sepsis to any of the paediatric units, with collection of blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs. Any infants identified as having GBS disease (defined as GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) will be recruited and followed up for two years to assess their neurodevelopment. A nested qualitative study will investigate stakeholder (pregnant women and their families, healthcare workers and community leaders) opinions of sampling for such a study and understanding and potential uptake of vaccines in pregnancy.

Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) describes abnormal coagulation processes that are attributable to trauma. In the early hours of TIC development, hypocoagulability is typically present, resulting in bleeding, whereas later TIC is characterized by a hypercoagulable state associated with venous thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. Several pathophysiological mechanisms underlie TIC; tissue injury and shock synergistically provoke endothelial, immune system, platelet and clotting activation, which are accentuated by the 'lethal triad' (coagulopathy, hypothermia and acidosis). Traumatic brain injury also has a distinct role in TIC. Haemostatic abnormalities include fibrinogen depletion, inadequate thrombin generation, impaired platelet function and dysregulated fibrinolysis. Laboratory diagnosis is based on coagulation abnormalities detected by conventional or viscoelastic haemostatic assays; however, it does not always match the clinical condition. Management priorities are stopping blood loss and reversing shock by restoring circulating blood volume, to prevent or reduce the risk of worsening TIC. Various blood products can be used in resuscitation; however, there is no international agreement on the optimal composition of transfusion components. Tranexamic acid is used in pre-hospital settings selectively in the USA and more widely in Europe and other locations.

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors and incidence of POPF with different types of pancreatic stump management after robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy (RAPD). Materials and Methods This study is a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent RAPD at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System between September 2007 and January 2016. The cohort was divided based on the type of pancreatic stump management: pancreatic duct occlusion with cyanoacrylate glue (CG), pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ), posterior pancreaticogastrostomy (PPG), and transgastric pancreaticogastrostomy (TPG). Results The cohort included 69 patients: pancreatic duct occlusion with CG (n = 18), PJ (n = 12), PPG (n = 11), and TPG (n = 28). Pancreatic duct diameter < 3 mm and duct occlusion with CG were identified as risk factors for POPF (p < 0.05). The incidence of POPF was lower when TPG and PJ were performed (p < 0.001). Conclusions Reconstruction with PJ and TPG had better results compared to pancreatic duct occlusion with CG and PPG.

Millions of pregnant women now download and use mobile applications to access, store, and share health information. However, little is known about the consequences. An investigation of their impact on perinatal health outcomes is particularly topical. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of mobile app interventions during pregnancy on influencing healthy maternal behavior and improving perinatal health outcomes. METHODS Searches of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, WHO Global Health Library, POPLINE, and CABI Global Health were conducted with no date or language restrictions. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included if they reported perinatal health outcomes of interventions targeting pregnant women, using mobile apps compared with other communication modalities or with standard care. The primary outcome measure was the change in maternal behaviors (as defined by trial authors), by intervention goals. Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. RESULTS Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 456 participants were included. All studies targeted participants in early pregnancy; however, wide variation was evident in participant characteristics, intervention, and study outcomes measures. Three trials were based in hospital settings, comparing women using mobile apps with routine antenatal care. One community-based trial gave all participants a device to promote physical activity; the intervention arm was also given a mobile app. All studies reported data for the primary outcome measure, describing some benefit from the intervention compared with controls. However, few statistically significant primary or secondary outcomes were reported. Due to insufficient data, the planned meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were not performed. CONCLUSIONS Due to limited numbers, heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, and outcome measures, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the effects of mobile application interventions during pregnancy on maternal knowledge, behavior change, and perinatal health outcomes. As millions of women utilize mobile apps during pregnancy, rigorous studies are essential for health care and maternity care providers to optimally design, implement, and evaluate interventions.","Daly, Lisa M; Horey, Dell; Middleton, Philippa F; Boyle, Frances M; Flenady, Vicki",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,95,2

High immunization coverage is essential for reducing the risk of vaccine preventable diseases. METHODS We used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. RESULTS SIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. INTERPRETATION Our results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities.","Silveira, Mariangela F; Tonial, Cristian T; Goretti K Maranhão, Ana; Teixeira, Antonia M S; Hallal, Pedro C; Maria B Menezes, Ana; Horta, Bernardo L; Hartwig, Fernando P; Barros, Aluisio J D; Victora, Cesar G",Vaccine,95,1

In order to explore the interactions between the IFN pathway and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and to identify potential IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that may be involved in suppressing the replication of RSV, we utilized an IFN pathway-specific microarray to study the effects of RSV infection on the IFN pathway in HeLa cells. We showed that RSV infection enhanced the expression of a series of ISGs, including oligoadenylate synthetase 2, IFITM1 (IFN-induced transmembrane protein 1) and myxovirus resistance 2. Our results also showed that the IFITM proteins potently inhibited RSV infection mainly by interfering with both virus entry and the subsequent replication steps, but not the attachment process. The antiviral effect of IFITM3 was not affected by ubiquitination modification. Furthermore, knocking down the endogenous and IFN-induced expression of IFITM1 and 3 facilitated RSV infection. Expression of the IFITM proteins was found to delay the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 through interfering with the detection of viral RNA by MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I). These results demonstrated that the restriction of RSV infection by the IFITM proteins was achieved through the inhibition of virus entry and replication, and they provided further insight for exploring the mechanism of IFITM-protein-mediated virus restriction.","Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Lei; Zan, Yanlu; Du, Ning; Yang, Yang; Tien, Po",The Journal of general virology,95,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS 35 patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled for TvRARP. Preoperative data of patients [mean ± SD: patient age 63.4 ± 8.1 years, BMI 28.6 ± 5.3 kg/m2 , tPSA 10.8 ± 4.9 ng/ml, prostate volume 30.6 ± 14.4 ml; median (IQR): biopsy Gleason score 6 (6, 7), and IIEF-5 score 18 (16, 20)] were collected. Preoperative assessment revealed 28 case of cT2a and 7 case of cT2b. All patients were continent preoperatively (defined as no pad required or 1 dry pad per day for precaution). Surgical results and perioperative complications were assessed. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS The mean operation time was 150 ± 35 min. Estimated blood loss was 100 ± 45 ml. Urinary infection was noted in 1 patient and managed with levofoxacin. Another patient complained of nocturia on postoperative day 14 and relieved with solifenacin succinate. Urethral catheters were removed on postoperative day 7. 32 patients achieved immediate urinary continence, with 3 patients returning to full continence on postoperative day 14. Postoperative pathology confirmed 24 pT2a cases, 9 pT2b cases and 2 pT2c case [Gleason score 6 (6, 7)]. Positive surgical margin was found in 4 patients (11.4%). No urethral stricture or urinary leakage was noted on urethrocystography taken 3 months after surgery. Urodynamic studies performed preoperatively and 6 months after surgery: maximal urinary flow [pre-op verse 6 months post-op, 12.2 (10.2, 14.9) ml/s vs 13.7 (10.1, 15.0) ml/s], bladder capacity [385.3 (351.3, 410.2) ml vs 370.2 (330.1, 395.4) ml] and voiding phase detrusor contractility [38.5 (27.8, 42.3) mmH2 O vs 35.6 (28.3, 41.3) mmH2 O]. During a minimal of 12-month follow up, no biochemical recurrence was noted in all patients. IIEF-5 score was 17 (16, 19). CONCLUSIONS The transvesical approach is a valid alternative for RARP in selected patients, providing promising postoperative urinary continence. Long term functional and oncological results requires further investigation.","Zhou, Xiaochen; Fu, Bin; Zhang, Cheng; Liu, Weipeng; Guo, Ju; Chen, Luyao; Lei, Enjun; Zhang, Xu; Wang, Gongxian",BJU international,95,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on bone mineral density (BMD) in axSpA. Electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi (q)-RCTs with pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Independent reviewers undertook screening, and risk of bias and quality assessments. Primary outcomes of interest were BMD at spine and hip. Eight studies (two RCTs and six qRCTs) were included (602 participants). Moderate level evidence favoured alendronate over placebo at femoral neck [mean difference (MD) 2.01, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35], but there was low-level evidence showing no effect at the spine. There was moderate level evidence showing no effect of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) on BMD at total hip (MD - 0.01, 95% CI - 0.06 to 0.04). Very low-level evidence demonstrated no effect of TNFi on spine or femoral neck. Moderate level evidence favoured neridronate over infliximab at the spine (MD 3.26, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.38), but low-level evidence showed no effect at the total hip (MD 2.75, 95% CI - 0.21 to 5.71). There were no eligible studies investigating the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions. We conditionally recommend alendronate for management of low BMD in axSpA. The balance of evidence does not recommend the use of TNF-inhibitors for treating low BMD.

The complex and heterogeneous nature of native human skin however creates difficulties for the construction of physiologically comparable organotypic models. Within the present study, we utilized bioprinting technology for the controlled deposition of separate keratinocyte subpopulations to create a reconstructed epidermis with two distinct halves in a single insert, each comprised of a different keratinocyte sub-population, in order to better model heterogonous skin and reduce inter-sample variability. As an initial proof-of-concept, we created a patterned epidermal skin model using GPF positive and negative keratinocyte subpopulations, both printed into 2 halves of a reconstructed skin insert, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We then demonstrated the physiological relevance of this bioprinting technique by generating a heterogeneous model comprised of dual keratinocyte population with either normal or low filaggrin expression. The resultant model exhibited a well-organized epidermal structure with each half possessing the phenotypic characteristics of its constituent cells, indicative of a successful and stable tissue reconstruction. This patterned skin model aims to mimic the edge of lesions as seen in atopic dermatitis or ichthyosis vulgaris, while the use of two populations within a single insert allows for paired statistics in evaluation studies, likely increasing study statistical power and reducing the number of models required per study. This is the first report of human patterned epidermal model using a predefined bioprinted designs, and demonstrates the relevance of bioprinting to faithfully reproduce human skin microanatomy.","Madiedo-Podvrsan, Sabrina; Belaïdi, Jean-Philippe; Desbouis, Stephanie; Simonetti, Lucie; Ben-Khalifa, Youcef; Soeur, Jérémie; Rielland, Maïté",Scientific reports,95,8

A new helmet (NH) has proven to attenuate this limitation of the standard helmet (SH) in both bench study and healthy volunteers. The authors compared a NH and a SH in intensive care unit patients receiving noninvasive ventilation for prevention of postextubation respiratory failure; both helmets were also compared with the endotracheal tube in place before extubation. METHODS Fourteen patients underwent 30-min trials in pressure support during invasive ventilation and then with a SH and a NH in a random order. The authors measured comfort, triggering delays, rates of pressurization (airway pressure-time product [PTP] of the first 300 [PTP(300-index)] and 500 [PTP(500-index)] ms from the onset of effort, and the first 200 ms from the onset of insufflation [PTP200]), time of synchrony between effort and assistance (Time(synch)/Ti(neu)), respiratory drive and frequency, arterial blood gases (ABGs), and rate of asynchrony. RESULTS Compared with SH, NH improved comfort (5.5 [5.0 to 6.0] vs. 8.0 [7.8 to 8.0]), respectively, P < 0.001), inspiratory trigger delay (0.31 [0.22 to 0.43] vs. 0.25 [0.18 to 0.31] s, P = 0.007), and pressurization (PTP(300-index): 0.8 [0.1 to 1.8] vs. 2.7 [7.1 to 10.0]%; PTP(500-index): 4.8 [2.5 to 9.9] vs. 27.3 [16.2 to 34.8]%; PTP200: 13.6 [10.1 to 19.6] vs. 30.4 [24.9 to 38.4] cm H2O/s, P < 0.01 for all comparisons) and Time(synch)/Ti(neu) (0.64 [0.48 to 0.72] vs. 0.71 [0.61 to 0.81], P = 0.007). Respiratory drive and frequency, ABGs, and rate of asynchrony were not different between helmets.

As an infectious disease with no specific treatment, several measures have been established to minimize the outbreak of this disease, including social isolation. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the behavior of adolescents during the isolation period. METHODS This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the Adolescent Health Studies Center. Data were obtained from a questionnaire prepared on Google Forms, sent by a multiplatform instant messaging application, and analyzed using the Stata 14 software. RESULTS A total of 208 adolescents with a mean age of 15.3 years (SD ± 1.8) answered the questionnaire, 57.7% were female. About 93.3% of adolescents said they were in isolation with a changed routine, 67.3% increased their food consumption, 86.5% were inactive, and 58.7% reported screen time over 8 h/d. There was an association between anxiety and increased food consumption (odds ratio: 3.9; CI 95% 2-7.5; p = 0.00), sleeping difficulty (odds ratio: 3.6; CI 95% 1.9-6.8; p = 0.00), and conflicting family relationship (odds ratio: 5.7; CI 95% 1.6-7.8; p = 0.01).

METHOD A cross-sectional, web-based study, conducted in Israel. Study' participants included 817 community and hospital nurses. The Occupational Commitment Scale for Health Professionals during pandemic (PanHP-OCS) was used to gather data. Univariate and multivariant analyses explored associations between the PanHP-OCS score and demographic and professional variables.

Current laparoscopic surgical robots are expensive, bulky, and fundamentally constrained by a small entry incision. A new approach to minimally invasive surgery places the robot completely within the patient. Miniature in vivo robots may allow surgeons to overcome current laparoscopic constraints such as dexterity, orientation, and visualization. METHODS A collaborative research group from the Department of Surgery at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the College of Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln designed and built a surgical robot prototype capable of performing specific surgical tasks within the peritoneal cavity. RESULTS The basic robotic design consists of two arms each connected to a central body. Each arm has three degrees of freedom and rotational shoulder and elbow joints. This combination allows a surgeon to grasp, manipulate, cauterize, and perform intracorporeal suturing. The robot's workspace is a hollow hemisphere with an inner radius of 75 mm and an outer radius of 205 mm. Its versatility was demonstrated in four procedures performed in a porcine model: cholecystectomy, partial colectomy, abdominal exploration, and intracorporeal suturing. CONCLUSIONS Miniature in vivo robots have the potential to address the limitations of using articulated instrumentation to perform advanced laparoscopic surgical procedures. Once inserted into the peritoneal cavity, the robot provides a stable platform for visualization with sufficient dexterity and speed to perform surgical tasks from multiple orientations and workspaces.","Dolghi, Oleg; Strabala, Kyle W; Wortman, Tyler D; Goede, Matthew R; Farritor, Shane M; Oleynikov, Dmitry",Surgical endoscopy,95,31

The standardized mortality ratio for 2020 was calculated with the 2019 mortality coefficients as standards. The results showed 39,146 excess deaths for the period studied and is higher among men. This increase was more significant among the capitals of the North, Northeast, and Southeast regions. In the other municipalities in these regions, the increase was observed in May, indicating a possible inland-bound COVID-19 transmission.

We have previously generated Affibody molecules that inhibit heregulin-induced signaling of the HER3 pathways. The aim of this study was to improve the affinity of the binders to hopefully increase receptor inhibition efficacy and enable a high receptor-mediated uptake in tumors. We explored a novel strategy for affinity maturation of Affibody molecules that is based on alanine scanning followed by design of library diversification to mimic the result from an error-prone PCR reaction, but with full control over mutated positions and thus less biases. Using bacterial surface display and flow-cytometric sorting of the maturation library, the affinity for HER3 was improved more than 30-fold down to 21 pM. The affinity is among the higher that has been reported for Affibody molecules and we believe that the maturation strategy should be generally applicable for improvement of affinity proteins. The new binders also demonstrated an improved thermal stability as well as complete refolding after denaturation. Moreover, inhibition of ligand-induced proliferation of HER3-positive breast cancer cells was improved more than two orders of magnitude compared to the previously best-performing clone. Radiolabeled Affibody molecules showed specific targeting of a number of HER3-positive cell lines in vitro as well as targeting of HER3 in in vivo mouse models and represent promising candidates for future development of targeted therapies and diagnostics.","Malm, Magdalena; Kronqvist, Nina; Lindberg, Hanna; Gudmundsdotter, Lindvi; Bass, Tarek; Frejd, Fredrik Y; Höidén-Guthenberg, Ingmarie; Varasteh, Zohreh; Orlova, Anna; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Ståhl, Stefan; Löfblom, John",PloS one,95,14

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy +/- concurrent chemotherapy. Pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured in a 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography using a liver dependent standardized uptake value threshold. Cox regression analyses were performed to find associations with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS High values of MTV (>37 ml) were independently associated with a worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-7.84) and OS (HR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.41-7.57). Similar results were found for high values of TLG (>247 g) for DFS (HR = 3.32; 95% CI, 1.44-7.65) and OS (HR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.45-8.07). CONCLUSIONS MTV and TLG can be considered as independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. Considering how easily obtainable they are, they may be useful for predicting clinical outcomes in these patients.","Rijo-Cedeño, Jefferson; Mucientes, Jorge; Seijas Marcos, Sara; Romero, Jesús; Royuela, Ana; Carbonell, Sandra; Benlloch, Raquel; García-Berrocal, José Ramón",Head & neck,95,1

One way to manage health emergencies is to build and sustain national capacities. The Ebola epidemic of 2014 to 2015 resulted in greater infection prevention and control (IPC) capacity in Liberia, but few studies have investigated if and how that capacity was sustained. The purpose of this study was to examine the maintenance of IPC capacity in Liberia after Ebola. METHODS For this case study, data were collected via direct observation of nurse practice, semistructured interviews, and document collection. Data were collected in two counties in Liberia. Data were analyzed using directed content and general thematic analysis using codes generated from the safety capital theoretical framework, which describes an organization's intangible occupational health resources. FINDINGS Thirty-seven nurses from 12 facilities participated. Ebola was a seminal event in the development of safety capital in Liberia, particularly regarding nurse knowledge of IPC and facilities' investments in safety. The safety capital developed during Ebola is still being applied at the individual and organizational levels. Tangible resources, including personal protective equipment, however, have been depleted. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE IPC capacity in Liberia had been sustained since Ebola but was threatened by under-investments in physical resources. Donor countries should prioritize sustained support, both financial and technical, in partnership with Liberian leaders. Occupational health nurses participating in disaster response should advocate for long-term investment by donor countries in personal protective equipment, access to water, and clinician training.","Ridge, Laura Jean; Stimpfel, Amy Witkoski; Klar, Robin Toft; Dickson, Victoria Vaughan; Squires, Allison Patricia",Workplace health & safety,95,1

METHODS A total of 254 Chinese participants (51% male, 129/254; mean age: 27.90±9.06y) with DED completed paper- and web-based versions of C-OSDI questionnaires in a randomized crossover design. Ophthalmology examination and DED diagnosis were performed prior to the participants being invited to join the study. Participants were randomly designated to either group A (paper-based first and web-based second) or group B (web-based first and paper-based second). Final data analysis included participants that had successfully completed both versions of the C-OSDI. Demographic characteristics, test-retest reliability, and agreement of individual items, subscales, and total score were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman rank correlation, Wilcoxon test and Rasch analysis. RESULTS Reliability indexes were adequate, Pearson correlation was greater than 0.8 and ICCs range was 0.827 to 0.982; total C-OSDI score was not statistically different between the two versions. The values of mean-squares fit statistics were very low compared to 1, indicating that the responses to the items by the model had a high degree of predictability. While comparing the favorability 72% (182/254) of the participants preferred web-based assessment. CONCLUSION Web-based C-OSDI is reliable in assessing DED and correlation with the paper-based version is significant in all subscales and overall total score.

Robotic approach to this procedure has proven its efficacy and is gaining popularity. The introduction of barbed sutures such as ""V-Loc™"" (Covidien) has provided an addition to the sutures available for pyeloplasty. This work provides our experience with the V-Loc suture for closure of pelvis in children for robotic pyeloplasty (RP). MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of 10 pediatric RP (da Vinci Robotic System) during which the V-Loc suture was used was performed. Comparison was made with 15 cases in which 5-0 Vicryl® suture was used as an alternative. Overall median age was 4 (range 9 months to 16 years), M:F = 14:9. All had confirmed PUJO on renal ultrasound and mercaptoacetyltriglycine (mertiatide) (MAG-3). RP was done in the standard Anderson-Hynes manner with the placement of a multilength JJ ureteral stent intraoperatively. Patients had removal of the JJ stent 6 weeks postoperatively followed by renal ultrasound 3-4 months later. RESULTS Twenty-five RPs have been performed between May 2013 and November 2015, of which 10 have had closure of the pelvis performed using the V-Loc suture and 15 with Vicryl. One patient (6.67%) in the Vicryl group underwent redo-pyeloplasty secondary to a stent-related complication. The entire V-Loc group made an eventful initial recovery; however, four (40%) developed worsening hydronephrosis and drainage on ultrasound and MAG-3 after stent removal, despite remaining completely asymptomatic. These four required either restenting and observation (n = 1) or redo-pyeloplasty (n = 3). Histology demonstrated a ""plaque-like"" inflammatory reaction at the pelvic suture line. CONCLUSION Closure of the pelvis using V-Loc suture material during RP can lead to a significant hydronephrosis requiring further procedures, including redo-pyeloplasty. These children can be asymptomatic and so extra vigilance on postoperative follow-up is essential.","Radford, Anna; Turner, Alexander; Ashraf, Junaid; Subramaniam, Ramnath",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

One is the noncompacted implantation method, and the other is the implantation method of using push-pull technique. During the process of the implantation, the changes of the arterial shape around the aneurysm and the changes of the wall pressure at the contact area between the braided stent and the inner wall of the artery are analyzed. The results indicate that the average contact pressure in the area of low porosity is 57 mmHg using the push-pull technique, and the average contact pressure of the parent artery is 10.45 mmHg using the non-push-pull technique.

Fluvoxamine may prevent clinical deterioration by stimulating the σ-1 receptor, which regulates cytokine production. Objective To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease. Design, Setting, and Participants Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo. Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n = 80) or placebo (n = 72) 3 times daily for 15 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. Results Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72%] women), 115 (76%) completed the trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 1.8%-16.4%] from survival analysis; log-rank P = .009). The fluvoxamine group had 1 serious adverse event and 11 other adverse events, whereas the placebo group had 6 serious adverse events and 12 other adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days.

As the immune microenvironment may play a role in clinical progression, it is crucial to examine molecular interactions to gain insight into host response. Therefore, to elucidate any differences in host response related to age, the present study imputed ligand-receptor interactions within the nasopharyngeal immune microenvironment in patients affected with SARS-COV-2. Tissue purities, the proportion of non-immune cells in the tissue sample, of 467 nasopharyngeal transcriptome profiles were estimated using known mRNA expression signatures of stromal/immune cells. Using the purity estimates and bulk tissue expression values, non-negative linear regression was used to estimate average expression of each gene in the stromal/tumor compartments. The inferred expression profiles were annotated with a curated database of ligand-receptor interactions and assumed as reasonable proxies for the law of mass action, allowing for quantification of directional ligand-receptor complex concentrations under equilibrium. It was found that older patients (>60 years) exhibited decreased interactions with receptors selectin L receptor SELL and increased interactions with pro-inflammatory chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CCR1. Younger patients showed increased interactions with various members of the TNF receptor super family (TNFRSF). The interactions were further related to immune cell subtypes, with older patients predicted to have less CD8+ and CD4+ resting T cells but increased neutrophil proportions. Collectively, the results suggest certain ligand-receptor interactions of the nasopharyngeal immune microenvironment are age-associated in response to SARS-CoV-2.","Batchu, Sai; Yu, Siyuan",Immunological investigations,95,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS All pediatric and adult SCD patients evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our institution between January 1995 and July 2009 were identified. The medical records of SCD patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI as well as an equal-sized cohort of SCD patients who underwent unenhanced MRI were reviewed for adverse (vaso-occlusive and hemolytic) events within 1 week following imaging. RESULTS Eight (five mild and three moderate) adverse events were documented within 1 week following contrast-enhanced MRI (38 patients and 61 contrast injections), while six (five mild and one moderate) similar events occurred within 1 week following unenhanced MRI (61 patients and 61 unenhanced MRI examinations). This difference in the number of adverse events was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 5.2). No severe adverse event occurred in either patient cohort. CONCLUSION Gadolinium-based contrast materials do not appear to be associated with increased risk of vaso-occlusive or hemolytic adverse events when administered to SCD patients. Larger, prospective studies using multiple gadolinium-based contrast materials would be useful to confirm the results of our investigation.","Dillman, Jonathan R; Ellis, James H; Cohan, Richard H; Caoili, Elaine M; Hussain, Hero K; Campbell, Andrew D; Strouse, Peter J",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,95,16

METHODS Patients with early axSpA from the DESIR cohort were included. MRIs of the SIJ (MRI-SIJ) and spine (MRI-spine), obtained at baseline, 2 and 5 years, were scored by 3 central readers. Inflammation and structural damage on MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine were defined by the agreement of ≥2 of 3 readers (binary outcomes), and by the average of 3 readers (continuous outcomes). The effect of inflammation (MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine) on damage (MRI-SIJ/MRI-spine, respectively) was evaluated in two models: i. Baseline prediction model: effect of baseline inflammation on damage assessed at 5-year; and ii. Longitudinal model: effect of inflammation on structural damage assessed during 5 years. RESULTS 202 patients were included. Both the presence of bone marrow edema (BME) on MRI-SIJ and on MRI-spine at baseline were predictive of 5-year damage (≥3 fatty lesions) on MRI-SIJ [OR=4.2 (95% CI: 2.4; 7.3)] and MRI-spine [OR=10.7 (95% CI: 2.4; 49.0)], respectively, when adjusted for CRP. The association was also confirmed in longitudinal models (when adjusted for ASDAS) both in the SIJ [OR=5.1 (95% CI: 2.7; 9.6)] and spine [OR=15.6 (95% CI: 4.8; 50.3)]. Analysis of other structural outcomes (i.e. erosions) on MRI-SIJ yielded similar results. In the spine, a significant association was found for fatty lesions but not for erosions and bone spurs, which occurred infrequently over time. CONCLUSION We found a predictive and longitudinal association between MRI-inflammation and several types of MRI-structural damage in patients with early axSpA which adds to the proof for a causal relationship.","Sepriano, Alexandre; Ramiro, Sofia; Landewé, Robert; Moltó, Anna; Claudepierre, Pascal; Wendling, Daniel; Dougados, Maxime; van der Heijde, Désirée",Arthritis care & research,95,1

However, frequent changes in the surface antigens of influenza viruses allow them to avoid antibody-mediated immunity. On the other hand, it is known that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) populations directed against internal antigens of influenza A virus are broadly cross-reactive to influenza virus subtypes. The present authors have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes made using unsaturated fatty acids are cross-presented by APCs via MHC class I to CD8(+) T cells and induce antigen-specific CTLs. Based on this finding, a liposome vaccine that is capable of inducing CTL response against internal antigens of influenza viruses and removing virus-infected cells in the host has been developed. The CTL-based liposomal technique might be applicable for developing vaccines against influenza and other viruses, such as hepatitis C, HIV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus, which frequently change their surface antigenic molecules.","Uchida, Tetsuya",Microbiology and immunology,95,27

Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is an excellent tool in rational drug design that takes advantage of accurate methods such as unbiased molecular dynamics (UMD) simulation for designing and optimizing molecular entities by understanding the binding and unbinding pathways of the binders. Supervised molecular dynamics (SuMD) simulation is a branch of UMD in which long-duration simulations are turned into short simulations, called replica, and a specific parameter is monitored throughout the simulation. In this work, we utilized this strategy to reconstruct the unbinding pathway of the anticancer drug dasatinib from its target protein, the c-Src kinase. Several unbinding events with valuable details were achieved. Then, to assess the efficiency and trustworthiness of the SuMD method, the unbinding pathway was also reconstructed by conventional UMD simulation, which uncovered some of the limitations of this method, such as limited sampling of the active site and finding the metastable states in the unbinding pathway.

The mosquito-borne alphaviruses cause a range of diseases from rashes and arthritis to encephalitis, and no licensed drugs are available for treatment or vaccines for prevention. The alphavirus virulence factor nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) suppresses the formation of stress granules (SGs)-a class of cytoplasmic condensates enriched with translation initiation factors and formed during the early stage of infection. nsP3 has a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that hydrolyzes ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and a C-terminal hypervariable domain that binds the essential SG component G3BP1. Here, we show that macrodomain hydrolase activity reduces the ADP-ribosylation of G3BP1, disassembles virus-induced SGs, and suppresses SG formation. Expression of nsP3 results in the formation of a distinct class of condensates that lack translation initiation factors but contain G3BP1 and other SG-associated RNA-binding proteins. Expression of ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsP3 results in condensates that retain translation initiation factors as well as RNA-binding proteins, similar to SGs. Therefore, our data reveal that ADP-ribosylation controls the composition of biomolecular condensates, specifically the localization of translation initiation factors, during alphavirus infection.","Jayabalan, Aravinth Kumar; Adivarahan, Srivathsan; Koppula, Aakash; Abraham, Rachy; Batish, Mona; Zenklusen, Daniel; Griffin, Diane E; Leung, Anthony K L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,95,1

We sought to determine how effective and safe procedural skill acquisition is in French ICUs and to identify failure and complication risk factors. DESIGN Multicenter prospective observational study. Invasive procedures performed by residents were recorded during two consecutive semesters. SETTING Eighty-four residents. SUBJECTS Eighty-four residents. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Number of invasive procedures performed, failure and complication rates, supervision, and assistance provided. Five thousand six hundred seventeen procedures were prospectively studied: 1,007 tracheal intubations, 1,272 arterial and 2,586 central venous catheter insertions, 457 fiberoptic bronchoscopies, and 295 chest tube insertions. During the semesters, residents performed a median of 10 intubations, 14 arterial catheter insertions, and 26 central venous catheter insertions. Complication rates were low, similar to those in the literature: 8.6% desaturation and 7.4% esophageal placement during intubation; 0.4% and 2.3% pneumothorax with jugular and subclavian central venous catheter insertions, respectively. We identified risk factors for failure and complications. Higher rates of failure and complications for intubation were associated with residents with no or little previous experience (p < 0.001); failure of internal jugular vein catheterization was associated with left-side insertion (p = 0.005) and absence of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.007). Supervision and assistance were more frequent at the beginning of the semester and for intubation and chest tube insertion. Finally, residents had less access to fiberoptic bronchoscopy and chest tube insertion. CONCLUSION Procedural skills acquisition by residents in the ICU appears feasible and safe with complication rates comparable to what has previously been reported. We identified specific procedures and situations associated with higher failure and complication rates that could require proactive training. Questions still remain regarding minimal numbers of procedures to attain competence and how best to provide procedural training.","Roux, Damien; Reignier, Jean; Thiery, Guillaume; Boyer, Alexandre; Hayon, Jan; Souweine, Bertrand; Papazian, Laurent; Mercat, Alain; Bernardin, Gilles; Combes, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Diehl, Jean-Luc; du Cheyron, Damien; L'her, Erwan; Perrotin, Dominique; Schneider, Francis; Thuong, Marie; Wolff, Michel; Zeni, Fabrice; Dreyfuss, Didier; Ricard, Jean-Damien",Critical care medicine,95,28

OBJECTIVES To compare the sensitivity of digital photos at D7 to clinical readings, to assess the number of positive reactions appearing at D7 only (late reactions) and after D7 only (delayed reactions). METHODS Patients undergoing patch testing recruited from 6 different European clinics were instructed to forward photos of the patch test reactions to the respective clinics at D7 (before attending the clinic) and at D21. Only allergens in the baseline series or TRUE Test® were included in data analysis. RESULTS Two-hundred-and-ninety-three out of 629 patients had a total of 599 positive reactions with 6.3% occurring at D7 only. When substituting the D7 reading with a photo (90% submitted), 26.3% of late reactions were missed and nine false positive reactions were found. Delayed reactions were detected in 4 patients at D21 (65.3% submitted). CONCLUSION Our data shows that if the D7 reading is not performed, 6.3% of positive reactions from the baseline series would be missed, and if substituting the D7 reading by digital photo, 26.3% late reactions would be missed.

A social causation perspective suggests that exposure to economic hardship will harm well-being, but a social selection perspective suggests that the appearance of health effects of hardship during the pandemic are attributable to the increased risk of exposure to hardship associated with poor well-being at the start of the pandemic. We also propose a third perspective, economic selection, which suggests that economic hardship prior to the pandemic negatively affects health and increases risk of exposure to hardship during the pandemic; consequently, an association between health and economic hardship during the pandemic may be spurious, and entirely due to pre-existing levels of hardship. To test these competing perspectives, we use a longitudinal study based in Canada that began in late March of 2020 and followed respondents monthly in April, May, and June. Baseline psychological distress and self-rated health, as well as economic hardship prior to the pandemic, independently predict the accumulation of monthly periods of hardship from April to June. The accumulation of periods of hardship from April to June is deleteriously associated with psychological distress and self-rated health in June. Controls for prior economic hardship and baseline health weaken the association between accumulation of periods of hardship and psychological distress, while also eliminating the association between accumulation of hardship and self-rated health. These findings favor a social causation perspective for psychological distress and a social selection perspective for self-rated health, with less evidence found in support of economic selection. This study took place during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, and associations with self-rated health may have become more evident as hardship further wore on individual well-being over a longer period of time.","Bierman, Alex; Upenieks, Laura; Glavin, Paul; Schieman, Scott",Social science & medicine,95,16

Survivors are vulnerable to further health set-backs, most commonly because of infection and exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. Awareness of survivors' challenges are important given the anticipated rise in critical illness survivors because of SARS-CoV-2 viral sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS Studies continue to document challenges of critical illness survivorship. Beyond the cognitive, physical, and mental health sequelae encompassed by postintensive case syndrome, patients commonly experience persistent immunosuppression, re-hospitalization, inability to resume prior employment, and reduced quality of life. Although recommended practices for enhancing recovery from sepsis are associated with better outcomes, only a minority of patients receive all recommended practices. ICU follow-up programs or peer support groups remain important interventions to learn about and address the multifaceted challenges of critical illness survivorship, but there is little evidence of benefit to date. SUMMARY Survivors of sepsis and critical illness commonly experience impaired health status, reduced quality of life, and inability to return to prior employment. Although the challenges of critical illness survivorship are increasingly well documented, there are relatively few studies on enhancing recovery. Future studies must focus on identifying best practices for optimizing recovery and strategies to promote their implementation.","Prescott, Hallie C; Sussman, Jeremy B; Wiersinga, W Joost",Current opinion in critical care,95,12

METHODS The CO-MY-COVID registry was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in neuromuscular referral centers and general hospitals of the FILNEMUS network (between March 1, 2020, and June 8, 2020), including MG patients with a confirmed or highly-suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a nasopharyngeal swab and/or SARS-CoV-2 serology, thoracic computed tomography (CT-scan), or typical symptoms. The main outcome was COVID-19 severity based on location of treatment/management (home, hospitalized in a medical unit, or in an intensive care unit). We collected information on demographic variables, general history, and risk factors for severe COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal regression models were used to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS Among 3,558 MG patients registered in the French database for rare disorders, 34 (0.96%) had COVID-19. The mean age at COVID-19 onset was 55.0 ±19.9 years (mean MG duration: 8.5 ± 8.5 years). By the end of the study period, 28 patients recovered from COVID-19, 1 remained affected, and 5 died. Only high Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class (≥IV) before COVID-19 was associated with severe COVID-19 (p=0.004); factors that were not associated included gender, MG duration, and medium MGFA classes (≤IIIb). The type of MG treatment had no independent effect on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS This registry-based cohort study shows that COVID-19 had a limited effect on most patients, and immunosuppressive medications and corticosteroids used for MG management are not risk factors for poorer outcomes. However, the risk of severe COVID-19 is elevated in patients with high MGFA classes [odds ratio: 102.6 (4.4; 2,371.9)]. These results are important for establishing evidence-based guidelines for the management of MG patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Solé, Guilhem; Mathis, Stéphane; Friedman, Diane; Salort-Campana, Emmanuelle; Tard, Céline; Bouhour, Françoise; Magot, Armelle; Annane, Djillali; Clair, Bernard; Le Masson, Gwendal; Soulages, Antoine; Duval, Fanny; Carla, Louis; Violleau, Marie-Hélène; Saulnier, Tiphaine; Segovia-Kueny, Sandrine; Kern, Léa; Antoine, Jean-Christophe; Beaudonnet, Guillemette; Audic, Frédérique; Kremer, Laurent; Chanson, Jean-Baptiste; Nadaj-Pakleza, Aleksandra; Stojkovic, Tanya; Cintas, Pascal; Spinazzi, Marco; Foubert-Samier, Alexandra; Attarian, Shahram",Neurology,95,33

One such target is the inhibition of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) by monoclonal antibodies. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. SEARCH METHODS We performed a Cochrane Rapid Review, limiting our search to published studies in the English language. We searched databases of the medical literature, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, as well as trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Our search extended from January 2000 to June 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials except cross-over trials and cluster randomised trials. We excluded all other study designs. Participants included had locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (synonymous with second-/third-/fourth-line therapy). This review focused on pembrolizumab (synonyms: MK-3475, lambrolizumab, Keytruda). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included study. The certainty of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. MAIN RESULTS We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 542 participants, which compared the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Results were reported after a median follow-up of 14.1 months (range 9.9 to 22.1 months).Primary outcomesPembrolizumab probably reduces the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.90; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 115 fewer deaths (191 fewer to 38 fewer) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may slightly improve quality of life (change from baseline to week 15 assessed with the Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; higher value reflects better quality of life; scale 0 to 100) with a mean difference (MD) of 9.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 13.50; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Secondary outcomesPembrolizumab may have little or no effect on disease progression (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to three fewer patients (42 fewer to 24 more) whose disease progressed per 1000 participants at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab probably improves treatment response (based on complete or partial radiologic response) with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.77; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 97 more respondents (27 more to 202 more) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on treatment-related mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.79; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to one fewer (12 fewer to 44 more) treatment-related deaths per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on discontinuations due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10). This corresponds to 54 fewer discontinuations per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 7 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.83, 95 CI 0.72 to 0.97; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to 107 fewer serious averse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 176 fewer). We downgraded two levels for study limitations and imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The use of pembrolizumab in men with advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy probably improves overall survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. At 12 months follow-up about 70% of those in the chemotherapy group had died, compared with 59% of those treated with pembrolizumab. We are very uncertain about the effects of pembolizumab on quality of life. Pembolizumab may also improve treatment response rates, and reduce the risk of serious adverse events, but may make little or no difference to discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events. These conclusions are based on a single trial that was sponsored by the producer of pembrolizumab.","Narayan, Vikram; Kahlmeyer, Andreas; Dahm, Philipp; Skoetz, Nicole; Risk, Michael C; Bongiorno, Connie; Patel, Neil; Hwang, Eu Chang; Jung, Jae Hung; Gartlehner, Gerald; Kunath, Frank",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,95,1

This study aims to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Malaysian children with confirmed respiratory infections between July 2014 and July 2015. Methods A total of 394 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected prospectively from children age 0-5 years old with ARTIs from hospitals in Kuala Lumpur. Respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay was used to identify the viral aetiology of respiratory infections. Results From a total of 394 samples, the positive detection rate was 79.9% (n=315). A total of 15 types of RNA viruses and a single type of DNA virus were detected. Enterovirus/rhinovirus (n=112, 28.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n=85, 21.6%), adenovirus (n=64, 16.2%), human bocavirus (n=34, 8.6%), and human metapneumovirus (n=29, 7.4%) were the five predominant viruses. Enterovirus/rhinovirus and RSV constituted most of the viral respiratory infections among young children, especially among children less than 1 year old. No coronavirus was detected among children between 3 and 5 years old. Co-infection caused by 2 or 3 respiratory viruses were detected in 52 patients (13.2%). Enterovirus/rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus demonstrated pronounced seasonality. The infection rate peaked during mid-year, while the lowest activity occurred during early of the year. Conclusions The use of molecular assay as a routine diagnostic in the hospitals can improve the diagnosis and management of respiratory tract infections among children.","Yew, Su Mei; Tan, Ka-Liong; Yeo, Siok Koon; Ng, Kee Peng; Kuan, Chee Sian",Journal of thoracic disease,95,1

Two thirds of the vaccinees contained the chronic SIVsmE543-3 infection (controllers), whereas one third did not (noncontrollers). In this study, we investigated immune correlates of heterologous challenge control in rhesus macaques of Burmese origin. Because depletion of CD8+ cells in the controllers by administration of anti-CD8α Ab abrogated the control of viral replication, CD8+ cells were required for the protective immune response. However, classical SIV-specific CD8+ T cells did not account for the protective immune response in all controllers. Instead, IL-15-responding CD8α+ cells, including CD8+ T and NK cells, were significantly higher in the controllers than those in the noncontrollers, before and after vaccination with deglycosylated SIV. It is well established that IL-15 signal transduction occurs through ""trans-presentation"" in which IL-15 complexed with IL-15Rα on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells binds to IL-15 Rβ/γ expressed on CD8+ T and NK cells. Accordingly, levels of IL-15 stimulation were strongly affected by the depletion of monocytes from PBMCs, implying key roles of innate immune cells. These results suggest that intrinsic IL-15 responsiveness may dictate the outcome of protective responses and may lead to optimized formulations of future broadly protective HIV vaccines.","Watanabe, Satoru; Fujino, Masayuki; Saito, Yohei; Ahmed, Nursarat; Sato, Hirotaka; Sugimoto, Chie; Okamura, Tomotaka; Hanaki, Kenichi; Nakayama, Emi E; Shioda, Tatsuo; Matsushima, Kouji; Ansari, Aftab A; Villinger, Francois; Mori, Kazuyasu",Journal of immunology,95,1

It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, CagY constitutes a remarkable VirB10 member detected by TLR5, driving crucial innate immune responses by this human pathogen.","Tegtmeyer, Nicole; Neddermann, Matthias; Lind, Judith; Pachathundikandi, Suneesh Kumar; Sharafutdinov, Irshad; Gutiérrez-Escobar, Andrés Julián; Brönstrup, Mark; Tegge, Werner; Hong, Minsun; Rohde, Manfred; Delahay, Robin M; Vieth, Michael; Sticht, Heinrich; Backert, Steffen",Cell reports,95,32

We evaluated: 1) the application of the principles of exercise training in prescribed programs; 2) the reporting of the components of the exercise prescription; and 3) the reporting of adherence of participants to the prescribed programs. METHODS Building upon a previous review, a systematic review was conducted searching OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases from 2012-2017. Randomized controlled trials of at least four weeks of aerobic and/or resistance exercise in men diagnosed with prostate cancer that reported physical fitness outcomes, including body composition were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS Specificity was appropriately applied by 93%, progression by 55%, overload by 48%, initial values by 55%, and diminishing returns by 28% of eligible studies. No study adequately applied the principle of reversibility. Most (79%) studies reported all components of the exercise prescription in the study methods, but no study reported all components of adherence to the prescribed intervention in the study results. CONCLUSIONS Application of standard exercise training principles is inadequate in exercise trials in men with prostate cancer and could possibly lead to an inadequate exercise stimulus. While many studies report the basic components of the exercise prescription in their study methods, full reporting of actual exercise completed is needed to advance our understanding of the optimal exercise dose for men with prostate cancer and promote translation of controlled trials to practice.","Neil-Sztramko, Sarah E; Medysky, Mary E; Campbell, Kristin L; Bland, Kelcey A; Winters-Stone, Kerri M",BMC cancer,95,1

One of the most realistic avenues for clinical translation of iBCI technology is to enable control of a computer cursor-i.e. movement-related neural activity is interpreted (decoded) and used to drive cursor function. Both nonhuman primate and human studies have demonstrated high-level cursor translation control using attempted upper limb reaching movements. However, cursor click control-based on identifying attempted grasp-has only been successful in providing discrete click functionality; the ability to maintain click during translation does not yet exist. Here we present a novel decoding approach for cursor click based on identifying transient neural responses that emerge at the onset and offset of intended hand grasp. We demonstrate in a human participant, who used the BCI system independently in his home, that this transient-based approach provides high-functioning, generalized click control that can be used for both point-and-click and click-and-drag applications.

Patient whole family's SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were positive. Since THI is a diagnosis of exclusion, other reasons that may cause ALP elevation should be ruled out. ALP activity decreased and turned to normal ranges within the following month. THI has been reported to be in association with various conditions. Its relationship with many viruses has been reported previously. CONCLUSIONS If ALP elevation is detected in patients with COVID 19 due to the increasing number of infections, THI should be considered if there is no other accompanying pathology.","Erat, Tugba; Atar, Müge; Kontbay, Tugba",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,95,31

The health-care professionals play an important role in risk communication;however, health-care professionals have been found wanting when it comes to risk communication during any health-care crisis. The doctors/health-care professionals, being the technical personnel, are required to provide the technical information in a nontechnical or laymen language to the relevant authorities, which in turn are expected to share this knowledge to the people at risk. This study attempts to unravel the perceptions of health-care professionals on this important topic concerning public health. Methodology: A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed for the study question. An online survey was conducted based on Google Forms using snowball sampling technique. The data, collected using a pilot-tested questionnaire, were compiled in MS Excel and analyzed using SPSS software version 23. Requisite permission was taken from the institutional ethic committee. All participants were informed of the voluntary nature of the study, and the data collection was done in an anonymous manner. Results: A majority of participants (61.5%) answered in affirmative when asked if they know what risk communication is and 13 (7.7%) were not aware of it. A majority of the participants (60.9%) perceived risk communication as an exchange of information between health experts and general public, whereas 23 (13.6%) participants felt that risk communication is exchange of information between health experts and other health-care workers. Rumor management was not considered an essential part of risk communication by about half (48.5%) of the participants. Conclusion: We found significant gaps in the knowledge and perception of risk communication in the health-care professionals, which can be attributed to lack of training. Risk communication needs to be incorporated as a part of formal medical education to plug this gap. © 2021 Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y. Patil Vidyapeeth.","Kumar, S.; Yadav, A.

The envelope glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFc’s capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration of AvFc was well tolerated; after 11 consecutive doses every other day at 25 mg/kg, there were no significant changes in body or liver weights, nor any impact noted in blood human albumin levels or serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology further confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-stage liver disease patients.","Dent, Matthew; Hamorsky, Krystal; Vausselin, Thibaut; Dubuisson, Jean; Miyata, Yoshinari; Morikawa, Yoshio; Matoba, Nobuyuki",bioRxiv,95,5

Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) stand out in particular, as the UK fared much worse in both dimensions. I study whether these differences can be attributed to a ""smarter"" German containment policy using the COVID-Town economic-epidemiological agent-based model. After calibrating the model to a German baseline scenario, I show that a British containment policy scenario can accurately predict the UK number of deaths per capita. Furthermore, the UK scenario is associated with higher economic and social costs. The differences can largely be attributed to COVID-19 testing capacities and policy timing. While timing is associated with the known trade-off between public health and economic/social outcomes, increased testing can reduce deaths and increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) simultaneously.Alternate abstract:La primera ola de infecciones COVID-19 tuvo un impacto heterogéneo en las economías europeas en lo que concierne a la salud pública y a los efectos económicos.

There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this topic. Methods Systematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates vs. D3 blood levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex and diabetes. Data was analyzed using correlation and linear regression. Results One population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission. They independently showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk (r(17)=-.4154, p=.0770/r(13)=-.4886, p=.0646). For the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/ml (17.4 - 26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32)=-.3989, p=.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/ml D3. Conclusions The two datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/ml to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.","Borsche, L.; Glauner, B.; von Mendel, J.",,95,10

The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families.","Makin, Robert A.; Durbin, Steven M.",bioRxiv,95,30

While humanity may face serious ""unknown"" or ""other"" existential risks, Ord does not explain why they should be treated a priori as greater risks than either nuclear war or climate change. Secondly, Ord identifies the most serious anthropogenic existential risks, which are nuclear war, climate change, other environmental risks, bioengineered pandemics, and artificial intelligence. Personally, I see Ord's book as making a valuable contribution to a particular understanding of existential risk, shaped largely by the author's conception of ""humanity's potential."".

We evaluated the analytical performance of the Abbott Panbio RADT on nasopharyngeal samples stored at the Ministry of Health National Reference Lab in Nassau, Bahamas. The Panbio demonstrated a test sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100% on 50 PCR negative samples and 50 samples presumed to be infectious based on having PCR cycle threshold values below 30. Additionally, in our examination of operator results there was low interpersonal variation (1%) among three blind operators and significant correlation between sample Ct value and perceived signal strength on the RADT device. However, three PCR positive samples below Ct 30 were misdiagnosed by RADT, including one sample with Ct value less than 20. These results support the use of the Panbio in symptomatic persons to detect active SARS-COV-2 infections, with the caveat that RADT-negative samples should be confirmed by RT-PCR.","Johnson, C.; Ferguson, K.; Smith, T.; Wallace, D.; McConnell, K.; Conserve, D.; martin, i.",,95,1

Here, we evaluated receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific monomeric B8-mIgA1 and B8-mIgA2, and dimeric B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 against intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. These antibodies exhibited comparably potent neutralization against authentic virus by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for RBD binding. While reducing viruses in lungs, pre-exposure intranasal B8-dIgA1 or B8-dIgA2 led to 81-fold more infectious viruses and severer damage in NT than placebo. Virus-bound B8-dIgA1 and B8-dIgA2 could engage CD209 as an alternative receptor for entry into ACE2-negative cells and allowed viral cell-to-cell transmission. Cryo-EM revealed B8 as a class II neutralizing antibody binding trimeric RBDs in 3-up or 2-up/1-down conformation. Therefore, RBD-specific neutralizing dIgA engages an unexpected action for enhanced SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection and injury in Syrian hamsters.","Zhou, Biao; Zhou, Runhong; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zeng, Jianwei; Zhang, Qi; Yuan, Shuofeng; Liu, Li; Robinot, Rémy; Shan, Sisi; Ge, Jiwan; Kwong, Hugo Yat-Hei; Zhou, Dongyan; Xu, Haoran; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Chu, Hin; Yue, Ming; Kwan, Ka-Yi; Chan, Chun-Yin; Liu, Na; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Du, Zhenglong; Au, Ka-Kit; Huang, Haode; Man, Hiu-On; Cao, Jianli; Li, Cun; Wang, Ziyi; Zhou, Jie; Song, Youqiang; Yeung, Man-Lung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Ho, David D.; Chakrabarti, Lisa A.; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Linqi; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",bioRxiv,95,25

This article analyzes the responses of 89 respondents, over 18 years old, in teleworking or enrolled in university online education, in a survey at the beginning of 2021, when Portugal was in a new state of emergency. Variables such as gender, age and parenthood were used, as well as ownership of equipment, own workspace, and quality of internet, comparing distance learning/work with traditional methods and measuring levels of satisfaction and willingness to adopt this model in the future. These results suggest an association of gender and parenting in the valuation of telework/distance education;women were more positive than men and participants with children were more positive than participants without children. The same was the case for respondents with their own workspace and better-quality internet. There is a strong relation between paternity and the preference for the distance model, in the sense of valuing the distance model, as well as a relation between those who have their own work space and the appreciation of the distance model.

However, most deaths have been associated with patients with underlying immune dysfunction or a compromised immune system. As no specific therapeutics and vaccines have been reported, the strengthening of the immune system through nutritional intake and exercise is essential. Also, previous studies have documented the immune-activating capabilities of Vitamin A and D, along with supplementary induction, yielding positive results in combating previous viral challenges.

In Indonesia, a home food gardening program was initiated in the early 2010s to optimally utilize home yards for improving the adequacy of food consumption and nutrition intake of households. In the present challenging situation of Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in home gardens to help mitigate food insecurity caused by food supply chain disruptions and the emergence of physical and economic barriers that limit access to food. This paper is a review of pertinent literature to find out the characteristics of home gardens and home gardening program in Indonesia and then examine their contribution to each pillar of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. The experiences of home gardens worldwide are reviewed to understand the global context of home gardens and food security. Literature reviews found a positive impact of home gardening program on food availability, access, and utilization. However, improving food stability through a home food gardening program is still a challenging task. This finding implies that the positive contribution of the home food gardening program to household food security is largely limited to the program period. Nevertheless, the program is still an important strategy to address food insecurity and nutrition deficiency of low-income households. Future research should assess factors affecting the sustainability of the program to derive viable models applicable in diverse circumstances. There is a need for research to assess the value and importance of home gardens as a coping strategy to reduce vulnerability and food insecurity in the present global Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The understanding of the distorted immune response is still in the early stages. Objectives: To analyze comprehensively immune profile in MIS-C patients including detailed serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with control groups. Methods: Blood samples of consecutive MIS-C patients were collected at admission. Flow cytometric analysis of all lymphocyte populations including T and B cell differentiation was performed. Immunophenotyping was performed by six-color panels for the detection of lymphocyte subpopulations. Anti-SARSCoV-2 specific antibodies were measured in the patients serum. The IgA and IgG antibodies against S protein, the IgG S1 and S2 specific antibodies, antibodies against nucleoprotein and neutralising antibodies were measured. Patients were assessed for a wide range of auto-antibodies, namely ANA, anti-ENA (Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, SRP, Mi-2, Ku, Pm/Scl 100, Scl-70), myositis specific antibodies (EJ, MDA-5, TIH-Y, Ro52, SAE-1, SAE-2, NXP-2), anti-dsDNA, anti-phopholipid antibodies (aCl IgA, IgG, IgM, antiβ2GPI IgG, IgM) and ANCA. Control groups to compare specific antibody response consisted of 14 healthy children and 19 healthy adults, who had SARS-CoV-2 infection in the last 2 months. Results: Samples of 20 patients were included (14/20 boys, median age 12.4 years). Patients had higher percentage of double negative T cells and low numbers of of cytokine producing T cells Th1, Th2 and Th17. . Numbers of immune competent and CD21+ transitional B cells were also lowered. All patients had positive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including neutralising antibodies. Nine (9/19;47 %) patients had high titer (≥1:160) of neutralising antibodies. Results were compared with 2 control groups;14 healthy children (7/14 boys;median age 8 years,) and 19 healthy adults, who all experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the last two months. Patients with MIS-C had significantly higher levels of anti-S IgA (p<0.0001), patients with MIS-C and healthy children had significantly higher titers of anti-S1 (p=0.001) and significantly lower titers of anti-S2 (p=0.016) in comparison to adults (Figure 1). No differences were found in the titers of neutralising antibodies and anti-N antibodies. All patients were ANA negative, 19/20 patients were anti-ENA negative, whereas 1 patient had anti-Ro antibodies in low titre. Three patients had aCL IgG in medium titre and 2 patients anti-beta2GPI IgG in low titre. Patients were negative for all other autoantibodies. Conclusion: The immune response in MIS-C patients is specific with most prominent differences in elevated percentage of double negative T cells and low numbers of Th1, Th2, Th17 and CD21+ transitional B cells. MIS-C patients have distinct serologic response with high anti-S IgA, high anti-S1 and low anti-S2 titres.","Zajc Avramovic, M.; Emersic, N.; Kopitar, A.

A Zoom-delivered family-based intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes has the potential to enhance access to psychosocial services. Methods: Nine families enrolled in a pilot of a 6-session online (Zoom) intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected via online focus groups and surveys. Results: Teens' ages ranged from 12-17 years (M=14.9, SD=1.76) and most self-identified as male (78%). All parents self-identified as female and most families self-identified as non-Hispanic white (78%). Qualitative results revealed that participants found the program to be generally helpful and would recommend the program to others. Perceived benefits included increased parental empathy toward teens, enhanced parental involvement in teens' diabetes management, and decreased parent-teen conflict. Participants conveyed that these benefits were particularly impactful given increased family contact and tensions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Identified areas for improvement included adding follow-up group sessions with parents to maintain program impact on parenting over time and to target teens in early adolescence, when family dynamics are more malleable. Quantitative results from paired t-tests of pre-post comparisons revealed no significant differences in teen or parental diabetes distress or depression (all p>0.05), but should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size. Conclusions: Adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents responded positively to this program and found it particularly relevant during the current pandemic. Zoom delivery of these programs may be instrumental in their feasibility, acceptability, and ultimately dissemination in the future.","Wong, Jessie J.; Lanning, Monica S.; Ngo, Jessica Wu Christine A.; Hanes, Sarah Linzmeyer Haley M.; Naranjo, Diana Hood Korey K.",Diabetes,95,1

To this purpose, the objectives are to identify the key terms and features used in the tweets, and the interest in the COVID-19 topics. To address those goals the paper proposes an approach that combines peak detection and clustering techniques. Space-time features are extracted from the tweets and modeled as time series. After that, peaks are detected and the textual features are clustered based on the co-occurrence in the tweets. Each cluster obtained is then associated to a topic. Results, performed over a real-world dataset of tweets related to COVID-19 in US, show that the approach is able to detect several relevant topics, of varying importance and character. A case study about the correlation of Twitter data with COVID-19 confirmed cases has been presented, also evaluating the feasibility of exploiting Twitter for the outbreak diffusion prediction. Results highlight a high correlation between tweets and real COVID-19 data, proving that Twitter can be considered a reliable indicator of the epidemic spreading and that data generated by user activity on social media is becoming an invaluable source for capturing and understanding epidemics outbreaks.

We collected data on number of eligible patients receiving EMLA, as well as patient and physician feedback via phone calls within 2 days post encounter. Balancing measures included ED length of stay (LOS), patient and physician satisfaction with EMLA, and side effects of EMLA. Results We needed 3 PDSA cycles to reach our goal of 60% in 3 months, which was also maintained for 5 months. PDSA cycles used educational interventions, direct provider feedback about non-compliance and patient satisfaction results obtained via phone calls. Balancing measures were minimally impacted: 75% good patient satisfaction, No adverse events but an increase in LOS of patients who received EMLA compared to those who did not (1.79 +/- 0.66 VS 1.41 +/- 0.83 hours, p<0.001). The main reasons for dissatisfaction for physicians were the increased LOS and the preference for procedural sedation or intranasal medications. Conclusion With a few simple interventions, our aim of applying EMLA to 60% of eligible pediatric lacerations was attained and maintained.","Sawaya, R.; Faris, N.; Mrad, S.; Assi, N.; Mesto, M.; El Kebbi, O.",,95,20

Controlling for a host of variables, the analysis revealed that faith in Trump’s denials was robustly associated with neutralization beliefs. Support for techniques of neutralization also was affected by, among other variables, low self-control and binding foundations, a construct drawn from Haidt’s Moral Foundation Theory. These results suggest that in the early stages of the pandemic, President Trump’s denials served as a likely source of cognitions justifying noncompliance with social distancing health norms. More generally, the data indicate that in his assumed role of the “Denier in Chief,” Trump may have been influential in prompting faithful followers to engage in conduct (e.g., be maskless, associate indoors) that exposed them to coronavirus infection as the pandemic unfolded throughout 2020.

The book then weaves history, strategy, policy, and technology into a compelling analytical narrative that sets the scale of the challenge Europeans and their allies will face if Europe’s peace is to be upheld in a transformative century. The book challenges foundational assumptions about how Europe’s defence is organized, the role of a fast-changing transatlantic relationship, NATO, the European Union, and their constituent nation-states. At the heart of the book is a radical vision of a technology-enabling future European defence built around a new kind of Atlantic alliance, an innovative strategic public-private partnership, and the future hyper-electronic European force it must spawn.

Lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) based test strips provide a rapid, low-cost, and point-of-care approach to antibody testing against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These convenient and scalable tests, however, are qualitative in nature and cannot quantify the immune response of the infected and/or vaccinated individuals. This study reports on the development of a rapid, low cost and portable thermo-photonic device that enables sensitive detection and quantification of antibody levels using commercially available COVID-19 Antibody LFAs. Unlike conventional LFA readers, the developed technology is based on sensing the infrared thermal radiation of tag gold nanoparticles following laser excitation (aka photothermal response). Our proof-of-concept results with humanized monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG demonstrate that the thermo-photonic technology can detect and quantify antibody concentrations within the clinically relevant range and with a limit of detection of 0.1 μg/ml. The reader in conjunction with antibody LFAs offers a low-cost, portable, and scalable solution for assessment of the degree of immunity in populations, quality control of convalescent plasma donations for antibody therapeutics, and monitoring the immune response of infected individuals and vaccine recipients.

The sharing economy is a business model of the digital economy, born by the fourth industrial revolution during the Great Recession of 2008 and developing in the context of the unprecedented economic crisis of 2020, when the impact of the coronavirus pandemic simultaneously collapsed production, financial markets and consumer demand for goods and services, and the task of ""conscious consumption"" - to spend money correctly and reduce costs - became vital. The concept does not focus on ownership but rather on the sharing of assets and resources. A predictive construct is given: the sharing economy is not so much the introduction of new technologies to implement the world-old idea of renting on digital platforms, but a new paradigm of production and consumption and as such leads to a circular economy, causes systemic changes that form qualitatively new principles of business organization, the economy and society as a whole. The study concluded that the sharing model has proven its viability not only in a period of stable economic development, but also in a contemporary crisis, which is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it was during this period of force majeure that the sharing economy model showed its importance both in everyday life and in business. This allows us to conclude about the further growth of the sharing economy, the creation of new services - both in spite of and thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Belova, L.

The current COVID-19 pandemic does not deviate from this observation, in that disproportionately high mortality rates are observed in the poorest territories. These inequalities result from three main, often cumulative factors: differentiated vulnerability to the epidemic, higher risks of exposure to the virus due to living conditions and poorer access to healthcare and prevention.

However, direct comparisons of optimal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more beneficial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint assistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-the-loop optimization to find single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walking for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, confirming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that effective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. Assisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy expended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton assistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts. Exoskeletons can assist the entire limb for maximum effect, but a single well-chosen joint can be more efficient when considering additional factors such as weight and cost.","Franks, Patrick W.; Bryan, Gwendolyn M.; Martin, Russell M.; Reyes, Ricardo; Collins, Steven H.",bioRxiv,95,1

In response, high-intensity rotas were implemented with short notice. This project aimed to fairly and safely step down the COVID response rota as normal working patters resumed.A cross-sectional survey was distributed to doctors on the medical COVID rota. It explored their views on the step-down process. The majority of respondents (68%) had concerns including discrepancy between on calls and lack of opportunity to plan leave. A document of key themes in the feedback was prepared and presented to senior clinical managers.Intervention and ImprovementThe new rota produced ensured an even distribution of shifts and honoured pre-existing leave. The new rota was compliant and ran to completion for every trainee. Comparison of stepping down to the trust rota vs our new rota reduced inter-trainee shift variation. Night shift discrepancy SD reduced from 2.89 to 0.97, long day (ward cover) on-calls reduced from SD 3.57 to 1.12 and long day (take) shifts SD 0.98 to 0.56.Following implementation a second cross-sectional survey was distributed. 85% agreed or strongly agreed that there was sufficient staffing levels ‘on call’ and 80% agreed or strongly agreed that there was sufficient staffing levels on the wards. 95% found they were able to take their annual leave and 80% agreed or strongly agreed that there was an even distribution of on-call and night shifts.ConclusionThe success of our project relied on good engagement with colleagues to collect a representative view for leverage in discussions with seniors, and produced a result that was fairer for trainees, sustainable, and preferable for rota coordinators and senior clinical management. Active collaboration in the rota design process will improve junior doctor engagement, well-being and job satisfaction.","Gargan, Alice Dunhill-Turner Natasha Ireland Dervla Mitchell Colin",BMJ Leader,95,10

In our unit, EROS for elective caesarean delivery (eCD) was established in 2017, improving patient satisfaction whilst decreasing length of stay.1 Since then, we have faced multiple challenges including staffing changes or absences of key members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT), diamorphine supply issues, the implementation of electronic medical records and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic. These have led to changes in our practice such as loss of the paper EROS patient companion and routine use of intrathecal morphine starting in 2019. We reviewed the impact of such challenges on the delivery of EROS. Methods: We audited compliance to EROS protocols as defined by our department over a 10-week period from July–September 2020. We compared results with data collected in the 6-week period immediately after the introduction of EROS in 2017. Data were analysed using Student’s t-test and Fisher’s exact test. Results: EROS outcomes are listed in the table: [Formula presented] Discussion: Our compliance with EROS suffered mostly in our pre-op interventions resulting in an increase in prolonged fasting. When questioned, 35% of women felt that the level of pre-op information could be improved. We believe the absence of key members of the EROS MDT, combined with the trust switching to electronic medical records contributed to a decline in the delivery and understanding of information before eCD. Moreover, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, women avoiding face-to-face appointments may also have had an impact;especially since half of our cases were first time eCDs. Encouragingly, we found that the percentage of women achieving a discharge on post-op day 1 remained consistent at approximately 50%. This is above the national average of 36%2 and demonstrates the impact of strong intra- and post-operative EROS processes. We believe that maintaining EROS champions in all of the MDT specialties involved would improve the consistency of pre-op information delivery. In the future, newer interventions, such as EROS information apps or videos may facilitate this process better.","Oyewole, M.; Neall, G.; Ciechanowicz, S.; Patel, N.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,95,24

The MR is a steroid receptor in the same family as the glucocorticoid receptor, with which it shares the ligand corticosterone in addition to the MR selective ligand aldosterone. Recent studies have shown correlations between central amygdala (CeA) MR expression and alcohol drinking in rats and macaques, as well as correlations between aldosterone and alcohol craving in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Additionally, our previous work demonstrated that systemic treatment with the MR antagonist spironolactone reduced alcohol self-administration and response persistence in both male and female rats. This study examined if reductions in self-administration following MR antagonist treatment were related to dysregulation of MR-mediated corticosterone negative feedback. Female rats treated with spironolactone (50 mg/kg; IP) showed increased plasma corticosterone following self-administration which correlated with reduced alcohol self-administration. Next, local microinjection of the MR-selective antagonist eplerenone was used to identify the brain-regional locus of MR action on alcohol self-administration. Eplerenone infusion produced dose-dependent reductions in alcohol self-administration in the CeA, but had no effect in the dorsal hippocampus. Finally, to assay the functional role of CeA MR expression in alcohol self-administration, CeA MR was knocked down by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) infusion prior to alcohol self-administration. Rats showed a transient reduction in alcohol self-administration 1 day after ASO infusion. Together these studies demonstrate a functional role of CeA MR in modulating alcohol self-administration and make a case for studying MR antagonists as a novel treatment for AUD.","Makhijani, Viren H.; Irukulapati, Preethi; Van Voorhies, Kalynn; Fortino, Brayden; Besheer, Joyce",bioRxiv,95,20

This focus on IFN evasion highlights the essentiality of these cytokines in controlling viral infections. Apoptotic caspases have recently emerged as important regulators of type I IFN signaling in both non-infectious contexts and during viral infection2–5. Surprisingly, they promote viral immune evasion despite being widely considered anti-viral from triggering cell death2–5. Indeed, we previously discovered that the AIDS-associated oncogenic gammaherpesvirus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) exploits caspase-8 activity to suppress the antiviral type I IFN response and promote viral replication5. However, the mechanisms of this novel viral immune evasion strategy are poorly understood, particularly how caspase-8 antagonizes IFN signaling. Here we show that caspase activity inhibits the DNA sensor cGAS6 during KSHV lytic replication to block IFN induction. Furthermore, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to reveal that the potent antiviral state conferred upon caspase inhibition is mediated by an exceptionally small percentage of infected cells expressing IFN-β, thus uncovering further complexity of IFN regulation during viral infection. Collectively, these results provide insight into multiple levels of type I IFN regulation by the cell and the way in which viruses co-opt them for immune evasion. Unraveling these mechanisms can inform targeted therapeutic strategies for viral infections and reveal cellular mechanisms of regulating interferon signaling in the context of cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases.","Tabtieng, Tate; Lent, Rachel C.; Sanchez, Alvaro Monago; Gaglia, Marta Maria",bioRxiv,95,1

It gives the conditions of the asymptotical stability on the disease-free equilibrium of SARDDE. It proposes the necessary conditions of disease spreading for the SARDDE. Based on the reported data of the first and the second COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing and simulations, it determines the parameters of SARDDE, respectively. Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; the blocking rates of about 80% and 97.5% to the symptomatic individuals cannot prevent the spread of the first and second COVID19 epidemics in Beijing, respectively. Virtual simulations suggest that the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government are not only very effective but also completely necessary.

Basolateral medium was collected 24-hours post-exposure and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentrations were measured as biomarkers of cytotoxicity and inflammation, respectively. Results Contrast microbubbles remained intact following nebulization and enhanced sonographic delineation of ex vivo porcine tracheal walls, indicating adherence of the nebulized MCA to the lumenal mucosa. No significant cytotoxic or inflammatory effects were observed in cultured hBE cells following exposure to MCA. Conclusions We present proof-of-concept for an inhaled MCA for the enhancement of sonographic evaluations of the large airways. Pending further evaluations for safety and effectiveness, inhaled MCA may be feasible for clinical ultrasound applications, such as enhancing ultrasound-guided tracheal intubation, detecting airway bleeds, or monitoring large airway diseases in pediatric populations.","Clapp, Phillip W.; Durham, Phillip G.; Antinori, Jamie C.; Walmer, Rachel W.; Chlebowski, Jessica G.; Velasco, Brian; Snow, Samantha J.; Dayton, Paul A.; Caughey, Melissa C.",bioRxiv,95,29

This study aimed at investigating the performance of three high-throughput assays and one rapid lateral flow test relative to the recommended criteria defined by regulatory authorities. Methods: A total of 133 samples, including 100 pre-pandemic samples, 20 samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, and 13 potentially cross-reactive samples were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) and 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker Biotechnology Co). Results: All assays performed with a high level of specificity; however, only Abbott reached 100% (95% CI 96.3-100). The pre-pandemic samples analysed with Roche, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology resulted in two to three false-positive results per method (specificity 96.9-98.0%). Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the highest sensitivity (100%, CI 83.9-100). The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology were 85.0%, 77.8% and 75.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably as well as their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should therefore, be made with caution.","Ekelund, Oskar; Ekblom, Kim; Somajo, Sofia; Pattison-Granberg, Johanna; Olsson, Karl; Petersson, Annika",,95,19

The students learned in virtual collaborative study groups;developed project-based teams;shared experiences, skills, and professional competencies;and collaborated directly with their teachers, the researchers, and the labor force. Three virtual learning groups of undergraduate students (N = 131), presenting comparable course descriptors and disciplinary group compositions, participated in the study. This study aimed to determine the effects of disciplinary composition on virtual learning group process dynamics from the students’ perspectives. This study applied a quasi-experimental between-subjects study design: quantitative methods were used to validate a research instrument and to determine statistical differences in the group process dynamic between the three groups;a qualitative method was applied to identify an in-depth understanding of the students’ perception about the group learning experience. By analyzing the group dynamics in the three settings—mono-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and cross-cultural—the research results show the advantages of each virtual learning composition in the group dynamic and learning outcomes in terms of group skill acquisitions. The conclusions can help teachers design virtual team compositions, a crucial stage in ensuring the achievement of desired learning outcomes.","Dincă, Melinda Luștrea Anca Onițiu Atalia Crașovan Mariana Berge Trond",Sustainability,95,1

CTs play an important role in developing new treatments, expanding or refining treatments that are already available, and/or identifying behavioral changes that can prolong or improve the lives of subjects. Therefore, we believe it is important for patients and for society to maintain the inclusion rate in clinical trials despite COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We collected the number of bladder cancer patients evaluated for the first time in the Oncology department, the number of patients who were offered a clinical trial, the screen failures and the number of patients enrolled in CTs. Results: In 2019, we were able to increase the enrollment rate in CTs for bladder cancer patients to from 24% to 43,75% thanks to the ASCO-QTP. With this program we created a list of measures and identified the ones that would have a greater impact. The one that seems to have had the highest impact is the diffusion of CTs in the Investigation Unit and the Genitourinary (GU) board. In 2020, thanks to this measure and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to maintain a 40,81% enrollment rate. When analyzing the patients evaluated for the first time in the Oncology department, 48 in 2019 and 49 in 2020, there were some interesting differences. In 2020, 42,86% had stage IV disease with respect to 39,6% in 2019, and only 22,44% had non-muscle invasive disease (NMIBC) versus 33,33% in 2019. However, thanks to the diffusion of CTs in the Investigation Unit and in the GU-board, which translates in an early derivation of patients to Medical Oncology and an increase in the number of available CTs, we were able to offer a CT to 73,5% of patients in 2020 against 60,4% in 2019. Although there was an increase of screen failures in 2020 (32,65% vs. 16,66%), 50% of them were due to the absence of a biomarker in a biomarker driven CT, with respect to 25% in 2019. Conclusions: Using ASCO-QTP as an instrument, we identified the importance of the diffusion of CTs and the close collaboration between departments. Maintaining these measures, we were able to uphold the inclusion rate in CTs for bladder cancer patients in 40,81% despite the later diagnosis of patients due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Vidal, N.; Gomez, J.; Galante, I.; Senovilla, J.

Long-read DNA sequencing can resolve the genetic context of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and is a promising tool for non- culture-based monitoring of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and ARGs in environmental samples, but has not been rigorously validated against conventional methods. We tested long-read sequencing using the portable Nanopore MinION for surveying pathogens, ARGs, and antibiotic- resistant pathogens in municipal wastewater, hospital wastewater, and surface water collected from Boston, USA and Vellore, India. We compared detection of enteric pathogens by assembly of long reads, with and without short-read polishing, and unassembled raw long reads for ARGs to multiplex real-time PCR. Using real-time PCR as a benchmark, long-read metagenomics was 49% sensitive and 75% specific at pathogen detection in assembled contigs, and 16% sensitive and 100% specific at detecting 28 clinically relevant resistance genes in raw long reads. Short- read polishing did not substantially improve pathogen identification or impact ARG identification in the assembled contigs, demonstrating that short-read polishing is not required, which greatly reduces costs. The high specificity of ARG detection supports portable long-read sequencing as a valuable tool to profile ARGs and antibiotic-resistant pathogens for environmental surveillance programs.","Fuhrmeister, E.

In many low-middle income countries, screening method was developed as an initial examination because of limited availability of RT-PCR tests. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the screening methods of COVID-19 accuracy in pregnant women. Material and Methods We recruited all pregnant women with suspicion of COVID-19 from April - August 2020 at Universitas Airlangga hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. The participant was divided into two groups based on RT-PCR results: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 group. The proportion of positive signs & symptoms, rapid antibody test, abnormal findings in chest x-ray, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value were then compared between both groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DOR) were calculated. Results A total 141 pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 cases were recruited for this study. This consist of 62 COVID-19 cases (43.9%) and 79 non COVID-19 pregnant women (56.1%). The sensitivity, spesificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of each parameter are as follow: clinical sign & symptoms (24.19%, 75.95%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 65.87%), rapid antibody test (72.73%, 35.06%, 4.35%, 96.94%, 36.53%), chest x-ray (40.68%, 59.45%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 58.76%), and NLR > 5.8 (41.38%, 72%, 5.66%, 96.80%, 70.81%).

Aeromedical evacuation represents a unique challenge in which to manage ETT cuffs. We evaluated three methods of automatic ETT cuff pressure adjustment during changes in altitude in an altitude chamber. METHODS Size 7.5 and 8.0 mm ETTs that are currently included in the Critical Care Air Transport Team allowance standard were used for the evaluation. Three automatic cuff pressure controllers-Intellicuff, Hamilton Medical; Pyton, ARM Medical; and Cuff Sentry, Outcome Solutions-were used to manage cuff pressures. The fourth group had cuff pressure set at sea level without further adjustment. Each ETT was inserted into a tracheal model and taken to 8,000 feet and then to 16,000 feet at 2,500 ft/min. Baseline cuff pressure at sea level was approximately 25 cm H2O. RESULTS Mean cuff pressure at both altitudes with both size ETTs was as follows: Control arm, 141 ± 64 cm H2O; Pyton, 25 ± 0.8 cm H2O; Cuff Sentry, 22 ± 0.3 cm H2O; and Intellicuff, 29 ± 6.6 cm H2O. The mean time that cuff pressure was >30 cm H2O using Intellicuff at both altitudes was 2.8 ± 0.8 minutes. Pressure differences from baseline in the control arm and with Intellicuff were statistically significant. Cuff pressure with the Cuff Sentry tended to be lower than indicated on the device. CONCLUSIONS Mean cuff pressures were within the recommended range with all three devices. Intellicuff had difficulty regulating the cuff pressure initially with increases in altitude but was able to reduce the pressure to a safe level during the stabilization period at each altitude. The Pyton and Cuff Sentry allowed the least variation in pressure throughout the evaluation, although the Cuff Sentry set pressure was less than the actual pressure.

We established a web-based e-learning tool to introduce general surgery residents to bariatric surgery and evaluate them to determine the most appropriate implementation strategy for Internet-based interactive modules (iBIM) in surgical teaching. METHODS Usernames and passwords were assigned to general surgery residents at the University of Alberta. They were directed to the Obesity101 website and prompted to complete a multiple-choice precourse test. Afterwards, they were able to access the interactive modules. Residents could review the course material as often as they wanted before completing a multiple-choice postcourse test and exit survey. We used paired t tests to assess the difference between pre- and postcourse scores. RESULTS Out of 34 residents who agreed to participate in the project, 12 completed the project (35.3%). For these 12 residents, the precourse mean score was 50 ± 17.3 and the postcourse mean score was 67 ± 14 (p = 0.020). CONCLUSION Most residents who participated in this study recommended using the iBIMs as a study tool for bariatric surgery. Course evaluation scores suggest this novel approach was successful in transferring knowledge to surgical trainees. Further development of this tool and assessment of implementation strategies will determine how iBIM in bariatric surgery may be integrated into the curriculum.","Azer, Nader; Shi, Xinzhe; de Gara, Chris; Karmali, Shahzeer; Birch, Daniel W",Canadian journal of surgery.

The progression of MV infection has been widely studied; yet, the pathway for virus entry in polarized human airway epithelia has not been investigated. Herein we report the use of a replication-competent Edmonston vaccine strain of MV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (MV-eGFP) to infect primary cultures of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. Previous studies with polarized Caco-2 cells (intestine-derived human epithelia) and MDCK cells (kidney-derived canine epithelia) demonstrated that MV primarily infected and exited the apical surface. In striking contrast, our results indicate that MV preferentially transduces human airway cells from the basolateral surface; however, virus release remains in an apical direction. When MV-eGFP was applied apically or basolaterally to primary cultures of airway epithelia, discrete foci of eGFP expression appeared and grew; however, the cell layer integrity was maintained for the duration of the study (7 days). Interestingly, utilizing immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we observed widespread expression of the receptor for the vaccine strain of MV (CD46) at greatest abundance on the apical surface of the differentiated human airway epithelia as well as in human tracheal tissue sections. These data suggest that the progression of MV infection through the respiratory epithelium may involve pathways other than direct binding and entry through the apical surface of airway epithelia.","Sinn, Patrick L; Williams, Greg; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Cattaneo, Roberto; McCray, Paul B",Journal of virology,95,1

Variant strains are selected from this quasispecies population in response to changing environment. The quasispecies dynamics of a virus existing within an infected host differs from that in a cell culture-adapted population. This study was carried out to explore the genetic variations present in the VP1 coding region of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype O derived directly from infected cattle tongue epithelium. Molecular clonal populations of two serotype O strains belonging to lineages Ind2001 (IND 30/2011) and PanAsia2 (IND 5/2011) were sequenced at VP1 coding region. For IND 30/2011, 19 clones were sequenced and analysis showed variations at 12 nucleotide positions (nt) resulting in 8 amino acid (aa) replacements. Similarly, for IND 5/2011 virus, 18 clones were sequenced, of which six showed nt variations leading to 3 aa replacements. Most of the variable positions mapped to the surface-exposed loops and some of them were found in the neutralizing antigenic sites (position 81, 149, 169, 186 and 202 of IND 30/2011 and 141 of IND 5/2011), which potentially could be beneficial in rapid adaptive evolution of the virus by giving rise to antigenic variants to overcome neutralizing antibodies.

Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) has pleiotropic properties and functions in viral morphogenesis as well as pathogenesis. Recent reports show that the inhibition of NSP4 expression by small interfering RNAs leads to alteration of the production and distribution of other viral proteins and mRNA synthesis, suggesting that NSP4 also affects virus replication by unknown mechanisms. This report describes studies aimed at correlating the localization of intracellular NSP4 in cells with its functions. To be able to follow the localization of NSP4, we fused the C terminus of full-length NSP4 with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and expressed this fusion protein inducibly in a HEK 293-based cell line to avoid possible cytotoxicity. NSP4-EGFP was initially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as documented by Endo H-sensitive glycosylation and colocalization with ER marker proteins. Only a small fraction of NSP4-EGFP colocalized with the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker ERGIC-53. NSP4-EGFP did not enter the Golgi apparatus, in agreement with the Endo H sensitivity and a previous report that secretion of an NSP4 cleavage product generated in rotavirus-infected cells is not inhibited by brefeldin A. A significant population of expressed NSP4-EGFP was distributed in novel vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm, not colocalizing with ER, ERGIC, Golgi, endosomal, or lysosomal markers, thus diverging from known biosynthetic pathways. The appearance of vesicular NSP4-EGFP was dependent on intracellular calcium levels, and vesicular NSP4-EGFP colocalized with the autophagosomal marker LC3. In rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4 colocalized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms, the site of nascent viral RNA replication, suggesting a possible new mechanism for the involvement of NSP4 in virus replication.","Berkova, Z; Crawford, S E; Trugnan, G; Yoshimori, T; Morris, A P; Estes, M K",Journal of virology,95,33

Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2% and 20% of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecaloral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzymeimmunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reactionbased techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old. The role of toroviruses and picobirnaviruses as causative agents of gastroenteritis is still emerging.

At the Hédi Raies Institut of Ophthalmology of Tunis (HRIO), the need to ensure continuity in the teaching of ophthalmology has stimulated the development of a new e-learning resource based on clinical case studies. AIM To evaluate level of satisfaction of HRIO residents in regard to clinical case-study-based e-learning of ophthalmology. METHODS Cross-sectional survey including 40 ophthalmology residents doing their internship at the ROHI during the first half of 2020. Learners were tutored in e-learning via the Moodle online learning platform and using a problem-solving format based on clinical case studies describing various ophthalmologic conditions. Data collection was carried out through an online survey after four months of training, designed to assess learners' satisfaction with the e-learning. RESULTS Mean age of participants was 29.95 ± 1.73 years. The majority had found the navigation easy, the content relevant to their training objectives, and were satisfied with the discussion forums as a method of communication. All respondents were satisfied with clinical cases presented through the platform and felt that they helped them to better understand the content. Among them, 97.5% considered that this teaching method corresponded to their training needs. There was a statically significant difference in the level of knowledge before and after e-learning teaching, taking into account the residents' appreciation (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance of virtual learning in ophthalmology in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. E-learning is well appreciated by ophthalmology residents, relatively easy to integrate to their training program, and reduces issues of time, patient availability and case exposure.","Falfoul, Yousra; Chebil, Ahmed; Halouani, Safa; Bouraoui, Rim; Fekih, Olfa; El Matri, Leila",La Tunisie medicale,95,8

Results from each antibody test were related to four explanatory variables (breed, age, gender and health status at the time of blood collection) using univariate ordinal logistic regression analyses, Mann Whitney U tests, one-sample sign tests or Kruskal-Wallis analyses, as appropriate. RESULTS Results from 637 Coronase and 191 7B FIP antibody tests were recorded. There were significant differences in median Coronase antibody titres between breeds of cats (P < 0.0005). Specifically, the median Coronase antibody titres of Siamese, Persians, Domestic Shorthairs and Bengal cats (100) were significantly lower than that of British Shorthairs, Cornish Rex and Burmese cats (400, P < 0.0005). There was no statistical relationship between the Coronase or 7B FIP antibody titres and age, gender or overall health status, even when considering only those cats in which clinical signs suggestive of FIP were present. CONCLUSION This study reinforces the complexity of interpreting serological tests for FCoV in both healthy cats and patients with signs compatible with FIR Unique to this study is the detection of a significant relationship between breed and median FCoV antibody titre. This supports the theory that breed related differences exist in response to FCoV infection. The distribution of median Coronase antibody titres by breed was very similar to the pattern of breed predisposition to FIP recently reported in Sydney.","Bell, E T; Malik, R; Norris, J M",Australian veterinary journal,95,33

Objectives of the study were to compare the venous velocity induced by the Vadoplex with established intermittent pneumatic calf and leg compressors (Covidien and Huntleigh). METHODS The venous velocity was established in ten healthy volunteers with standardised Duplex ultraonography of the common femoral vein. Measurements were taken at rest and on standing, with each device inactive and active. RESULTS The Vadoplex induced an increased femoral venous velocity at least as enhanced as established calf and full leg sleeves.

Differential susceptibilities of primary and recall CD8+ T cell responses to the inhibitory CNS environment were monitored in naive and CD8+ T cell-immune mice challenged with a neurotropic coronavirus. Accelerated virus clearance and limited spread in immunized mice was associated with a rapid and increased CNS influx of virus-specific secondary CD8+ T cells. CNS-derived secondary CD8+ T cells exhibited increased cytolytic activity and IFN-gamma expression per cell compared with primary CD8+ T cells. However, both Ag-specific primary and secondary CD8+ T cells demonstrated similar contraction rates. Thus, CNS persistence of increased numbers of secondary CD8+ T cells reflected differences in the initial pool size during peak inflammation rather than enhanced survival. Unlike primary CD8+ T cells, persisting secondary CD8+ T cells retained ex vivo cytolytic activity and expressed high levels of IFN-gamma following Ag stimulation. However, both primary and secondary CD8+ T cells exhibited reduced capacity to produce TNF-alpha, differentiating them from effector memory T cells. Activation of primary and secondary CD8+ T cells in the same host using adoptive transfers confirmed similar survival, but enhanced and prolonged effector function of secondary CD8+ T cells in the CNS. These data suggest that an instructional program intrinsic to T cell differentiation, rather than Ag load or factors in the inflamed CNS, prominently regulate CD8+ T cell function.","Ramakrishna, Chandran; Stohlman, Stephen A; Atkinson, Roscoe A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of immunology,95,16

Different groups of PCPs could have different concerns and preparedness level. We assessed the concerns, perceived impact and preparedness for an outbreak among PCPs in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey of PCPs working in private practice (n=200) and public clinics (n=205) from March to June 2006 with an anonymous self-administered questionnaire on concerns (12- items), perceived impact (10 items) and preparedness (10 items) for an outbreak. RESULTS Two hundred and eighty-five PCPs responded - 149 (response rate: 72.7%) public and 136 (response rate: 67.3%) private. The majority were concerned about risk to their health from their occupation (95.0%) and falling ill with AI (89.7%). Most (82.5%) accepted the risk and only 33 (11.8%) would consider stopping work. For perceived impact, most felt that people would avoid them (69.6%) and their families (54.1%). The majority (81.3%) expected an increased workload and feeling more stressed at work (86.9%). For preparedness, 78.7% felt personally prepared for an outbreak. Public PCPs were more likely to be involved in infection-control activities and felt that their workplaces were prepared. CONCLUSIONS Most PCPs felt personally prepared for an outbreak but were concerned about their exposure to AI and falling ill. Other concerns included social ostracism for themselves and their families. Public PCPs appeared to have a higher level of preparation. Addressing concerns and improving level of preparedness are crucial to strengthen the primary-care response for any AI outbreak.","Wong, Teck Yee; Koh, Gerald C H; Cheong, Seng Kwing; Sundram, Meena; Koh, Kelvin; Chia, Sin Eng; Koh, David","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",95,16

In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth rates.","Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi; Kabi, Prasenjit; Unni, Vishnu R.; Saha, Abhishek",,95,1

The investigator-initiated studies were focused on integrating disease-associated, molecular, and physiological endpoints previously found by academic scientists into an industry standard guideline-compliant toxicity study. Thus, the goal of this collaboration was to provide a more comprehensive dataset upon which to base safety standards and to determine whether industry-standard tests are as sensitive and predictive as molecular and disease-associated endpoints. The goal of this report is to integrate the findings from the investigator-initiated studies into a comprehensive overview of the observed impacts of BPA across the multiple organs and systems analyzed. For each organ system, we provide the rationale for the study, an overview of methodology, and summarize major findings. We then compare the results of the CLARITY-BPA studies across organ systems with the results of previous peer-reviewed studies from independent labs. Finally, we discuss potential influences that contributed to differences between studies. Developmental exposure to BPA can lead to adverse effects in multiple organs systems, including the brain, prostate gland, urinary tract, ovary, mammary gland, and heart.

Because the low dose of BPA affected endpoints in the same animals across organs evaluated in different labs, we conclude that these are biologically - and toxicologically - relevant.","Heindel, Jerrold J; Belcher, Scott; Flaws, Jodi A; Prins, Gail S; Ho, Shuk-Mei; Mao, Jiude; Patisaul, Heather B; Ricke, William; Rosenfeld, Cheryl S; Soto, Ana M; Vom Saal, Frederick S; Zoeller, R Thomas",Reprod. toxicol.

The purpose of this study is to facilitate universities in planning disease mitigation interventions as they respond to the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based model is developed to mimic the virus transmission dynamics on campus. Scenario-based experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions including course modality shift (from face-to-face to online), social distancing, mask use and vaccination. A case study is performed for a typical US university. Findings With 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% course modality shift, the number of total cases can be reduced to 3.9%, 20.9%, 35.6%, 60.9% and 96.8%, respectively, comparing against the baseline scenario (no interventions). More than 99.9% of the total infections can be prevented when combined social distancing and mask use are implemented even without course modality shift. If vaccination is implemented without other interventions, the reductions are 57.1%, 90.6% and 99.6% with 80%, 85% and 90% vaccine efficacies, respectively. In contrast, more than 99% reductions are found with all three vaccine efficacies if mask use is combined. Practical implications This study provides useful implications for supporting universities in mitigating transmissions on campus and planning operations for the upcoming semesters. Originality/value An agent-based model is developed to investigate COVID-19 transmissions on campus and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation interventions.","Zhou, Y.; Li, L.; Ghasemi, Y.; Kallagudde, R.; Goyal, K.; Thakur, D.",Information Discovery and Delivery,95,16

The lack of protective vaccine or treatment led most of the countries to follow the flattening of the infection curve with social isolation measures. There is evidence that socioeconomic inequalities have been shaping the COVID-19 burden among low and middle-income countries. This study described what sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were associated with the greatest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality and how did the importance of key neighbourhood-level socioeconomic factors change over time during the early stages of the pandemic in the Rio de Janeiro municipality, Brazil. METHODS: We linked socioeconomic attributes to confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 and computed age-standardised incidence and mortality rates by domains such as age, gender, crowding, education, income and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: The evidence suggests that although age-standardised incidence rates were higher in wealthy neighbourhoods, age-standardised mortality rates were higher in deprived areas during the first 2 months of the pandemic. The age-standardised mortality rates were also higher in males, and in areas with a predominance of people of colour, which are disproportionately represented in more vulnerable groups. The population also presented COVID-19 'rejuvenation', that is, people became risk group younger than in developed countries. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is a strong health gradient for COVID-19 death risk during the early stages of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases continued to move towards the urban periphery and to more vulnerable communities, threatening the health system functioning and increasing the health gradient.","Silva, Julio; Ribeiro-Alves, Marcelo",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),95,26

The maximum R2O3 content of light rare-earth compounds reached 63 mol % and decreased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+. The thermal, optical, vibrational, and structural properties were investigated, particularly for 50R2O3-50B2O3 glasses. The glass transition temperature increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+, while the thermal stability was not affected by the glass composition. The packing density increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+ due to lanthanoid contraction. Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that, in the rare-earth-rich glasses, no conventional three-dimensional networks consisting of corner-sharing BOn (n = 3 or 4) units existed because all B atoms were formed as isolated BO3 units. The simple environment around B atoms in the glasses led to additional IR transmittance regions, irrespective of the kinds of R. The total correlation functions obtained from high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements were analyzed using the pair-function method and compared with those of various RBO3 crystalline phases. It was suggested that the local structure around R resembles the &#957;-NdBO3-type crystal structure, and the O coordination number of R ranged from 6.5 to 7.7, smaller than that of the crystalline phase. The glass-forming ability depending on R was discussed based on the structural similarities between the melt, glass, and crystalline phases.","Sasaki, Shunta; Masuno, Atsunobu; Ohara, Koji; Yanaba, Yutaka; Inoue, Hiroyuki; Watanabe, Yasuhiro; Kohara, Shinji",Inorg. chem,95,33

It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (e-VLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made e-VLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated e-VLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered e-VLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.","Bellier, Bertrand; Saura, Alicia; Lujan, Lucas; Molina, Cecilia; Lujan, Hugo D; Klatzmann, David",,95,20

The N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to quantify the viral load in the wastewater using RT-qPCR. The trend in Ct values in the wastewater samples mirrored the number of new daily positive cases officially reported for the country, confirmed by RT-qPCR testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 100% of the influent wastewater samples (7889 ± 1421 copy/L - 542,056 ± 25,775 copy/L, based on the N1 assay). A mathematical model for wastewater-based epidemiology was developed and used to estimate the number of people in the population infected with COVID-19 from the N1 Ct values in the wastewater samples. The estimated number of infected population on any given day using the wastewater-based epidemiology approach declined from 542,313 ± 51,159 to 31,181 ± 3081 over the course of the sampling period, which was significantly higher than the officially reported numbers. However, seroprevalence data from Qatar indicates that diagnosed infections represented only about 10% of actual cases. The model estimates were lower than the corrected numbers based on application of a static diagnosis ratio of 10% to the RT-qPCR identified cases, which is assumed to be due to the difficulty in quantifying RNA losses as a model term. However, these results indicate that the presented WBE modeling approach allows for a realistic assessment of incidence trend in a given population, with a more reliable estimation of the number of infected people at any given point in time than can be achieved using human biomonitoring alone.","Saththasivam, Jayaprakash; El-Malah, Shimaa S; Gomez, Tricia A; Jabbar, Khadeeja A; Remanan, Reshma; Krishnankutty, Arun K; Ogunbiyi, Oluwaseun; Rasool, Kashif; Ashhab, Sahel; Rashkeev, Sergey; Bensaad, Meryem; Ahmed, Ayeda A; Mohamoud, Yasmin A; Malek, Joel A; Abu Raddad, Laith J; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Abu Halaweh, Hussein A; Lawler, Jenny; Mahmoud, Khaled A",Sci Total Environ,95,1

MEHODS: An online survey was used to explore the views of young people with epilepsy (n = 71) and caregivers (n = 130) in June 2020. It included questions on the impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions on the child's epilepsy and on child and parental wellbeing. RESULTS: One in three young people and 29 % of caregivers reported that the young person's seizures had increased during the pandemic (only 10 % of young people and 8% of caregivers reported a decrease). Half of young people reported that they were more reluctant to go to hospital. Thirty-one percent of young people and 20 % of parents reported difficulties getting epilepsy medication whilst a significant minority of young people (18 %) and caregivers (25 %) reported that the young person had investigations/assessments cancelled by their hospital. The majority of young people reported their sleep (72 %), mood (64 %) and levels of physical activity (53 %) had deteriorated. Caregivers experienced increases in stress (55 %) and anxiety (52 %). Epilepsy nurses were seen as the most helpful support CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the pandemic and associated restrictions have had a negative impact on young people with epilepsy. Perceived increases in seizures, reluctance to go to hospital and cancelled investigations are likely to impact on epilepsy management. The wider psychosocial impact is also likely to be significant with increases in child and caregiver mental health problems in an already vulnerable group.","Reilly, Colin; Muggeridge, Amy; Cross, J Helen",Seizure,95,32

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki's disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH. Of 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C (laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and 4 with suspected MIS-C (met clinical and epidemiologic criteria), 53 (54%) were male; 31 of 78 (40%) were black, and 31 of 85 (36%) were Hispanic. A total of 31 patients (31%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 42 (42%) were 6 to 12 years of age, and 26 (26%) were 13 to 20 years of age.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of HSYF on the progression to severe disease in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a quarantine station in Wuchang District, Wuhan. Using the real-time Internet information collection application and Centers for Disease Control for the Wuchang District, patient data were collected through patient self-reports and follow-ups. HSYF intervention was defined as the exposure. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who progressed to a severe disease status, and a stratification analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify influencing factors that may affect the outcome. Further, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effect of HSYF intervention on the conversion of mild and moderate to a severe disease status. Totally, 721 mild and moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 430 HSYF users (exposed group) and 291 non-users (control group). No cases in the exposed group and 19 (6.5 %, P < 0.001) cases in the control group progressed to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -6.5 % [95 % confidence interval (CI): (-8.87 %, -4.13 %)]. Univariate regression analysis revealed sex (male), age, fever, cough, and fatigue as risk factors for progression to severe disease. After PSM, none of the HSYF users and 7 (4.7 %, P = 0.022) non-users transitioned to severe disease, and the difference between the two groups (exposed group-control group) was -4.7 % [95 % CI: (-8.2 %, -1.2 %)]. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that sex (male) [OR: 3.145; 95 % CI: 1.036-9.545; P = 0.043] and age (> 48 years) [odds ratio (OR): 1.044; 95 % CI: 1.001-1.088; P = 0.044] were independent risk factors for conversion to severe disease. Therefore, HSYF can significantly reduce the progression to severe disease in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, which may effectively prevent and treat the disease. However, further larger clinical studies are required to verify our results.","Tian, Jiaxing; Yan, Shiyan; Wang, Han; Zhang, Ying; Zheng, Yujiao; Wu, Haoran; Li, Xiuyang; Gao, Zezheng; Ai, Yanke; Gou, Xiaowen; Zhang, Lei; He, Liyun; Lian, Fengmei; Liu, Baoyan; Tong, Xiaolin",Pharmacol Res,95,20

Method We overview recent research about stuttering and social anxiety in the context of contemporary cognitive models of social anxiety disorder. That emerging evidence for self-focused attention and safety behavior use with those who stutter is considered in relation to current treatment approaches for stuttering: speech restructuring and social anxiety management. Results The emerging information about social anxiety and stuttering suggests a conflict between the two clinical approaches. For those clients who wish to control their stuttering and where speech restructuring is deemed the most suitable approach, it is possible that speech restructuring may (a) induce or increase self-focused attention, (b) promote the use of safety behaviors, and (c) become a safety behavior itself. This conflict needs to be explored further within clinical and research contexts. Conclusions The issues raised in this review article are complex. It appears that evidence-based speech treatment procedures are in conflict with current best-practice treatment procedures that deal with social anxiety. In this review article, we propose directions for future research to inform the development of improved treatments for those who stutter and recommendations for interim clinical management of stuttering.","Lowe, Robyn; Menzies, Ross; Onslow, Mark; Packman, Ann; O039,; Brian, Sue",J Speech Lang Hear Res,95,7

Different types of ethical issues in COVID-19 communication are presented in four main sections. The first deals with ethical issues in informing the public about the risk of the pandemic and dilemmas regarding communicating uncertainty, using threats and scare tactics, and framing the pandemic as a war. The second concerns unintended consequences that relate to increasing inequities, stigmatization, ageism, and delaying medical care. The third raises ethical issues in communicating about specific mitigation practices: contact tracing, wearing face masks, spatial (also referred to as social) distancing, and handwashing or sanitizing. The fourth concerns appealing to positive social values associated with solidarity and personal responsibility, and ethical challenges when using these appeals.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of the pandemic to parenting stress, exploring differences in parenting stress among new parents before and during the crisis, the role of background and personal variables, and the possibility that the study phase moderated the associations of gender and personal resources with parenting stress. METHOD: Israeli parents (n = 1591) whose first child was 3-12 months old were recruited twice through social media: in 2019, before the spread of COVID-19 (n = 985); and in March 2020, during the pandemic (n = 606). RESULTS: Sociodemographic variables, perception of the childbirth as traumatic, lower meaning in life, higher search for meaning, less marital satisfaction, and study phase all contributed to greater parenting stress. In addition, the association between gender and stress was moderated by study phase, with fathers reporting a greater increase in stress during the pandemic. Moreover, only during the pandemic did fathers report higher parenting stress than mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the vulnerability of new parents of young infants to parenting stress during the crisis, and the special attention which should be paid to fathers.

As a C-2 epimer of glucose, d-mannose can alleviate bone loss and repress immunopathology by upregulating regulatory T cells; however, the role of d-mannose in OA-related cartilage degeneration remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the chondroprotective effect of d-mannose in vitro and in vivo on OA. We found that incubating interleukin (IL)-1ß-treated rat chondrocytes with d-mannose restrained OA degeneration by elevating cell proliferation, strongly activating autophagy, reducing apoptosis, and downregulating catabolism. Additionally, oral gavage administration of d-mannose to monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-treated rats revealed that a median (1.25 g/kg/day) rather than high or low dose of d-mannose suppressed OA progression and attenuated OA development based on lower macroscopic scores for cartilage, decreased histological scores for cartilage and synovium, strongly activated autophagy, and downregulated catabolism. In terms of a downstream mechanism, we showed that d-mannose might attenuate OA degeneration by activating autophagy in IL-1ß-treated rat chondrocytes by promoting the phosphorylation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our in vitro findings revealed that d-mannose delayed IL-1ß-induced OA degeneration in rat chondrocytes by enhancing autophagy activation through the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, the in vivo results indicated that a median dose of d-mannose suppressed MIA-induced OA development. These results suggested that d-mannose exhibits chondroprotective effects and represents a potential disease-modifying drug and novel therapeutic agent for OA.","Lin, Zhiming; Miao, Jianing; Zhang, Tao; He, Ming; Zhou, Xiaonan; Zhang, He; Gao, Yue; Bai, Lunhao",Biomed Pharmacother,95,16

We aimed to analyze cognitive decline during the pandemic year in people evaluated in a memory clinic in northern Italy, the epicenter of COVID-19 spread. (2) Methods: A single-center retrospective study was carried out, including individuals with annual follow-up evaluated in three different years (2020-GROUP, 2019-GROUP, 2018-GROUP). We performed an intergroup comparison of cognitive decline over a one-year follow-up, and an intragroup comparison in the 2020-GROUP to analyze the five-year cognitive decline trajectory, as measured by the MMSE. (3) Results: The 2020-GROUP showed a significant loss of MMSE points per year in the considered follow-up period compared with the 2019-GROUP and 2018-GROUP (p = 0.021).

If not detected and treated in time, COVID-19 can cause multi-organ failure and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the behavior of the spread of COVID-19 as well as the projection of infections and deaths. This information is very relevant so that public health organizations can distribute financial resources efficiently and take appropriate containment measures. In this research, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile. METHODS: The methodology used in this research consisted of modeling cases of both confirmed diagnoses and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA henceforth) models, Exponential Smoothing techniques, and Poisson models for time-dependent count data. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions using a training set and a test set. RESULTS: The dataset used in this research indicated that the most appropriate model is the ARIMA time series model for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Chile, the most suitable approach is the damped trend method. CONCLUSION: The ARIMA models are an alternative to modeling the behavior of the spread of COVID-19; however, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, other methodologies can better predict the behavior of these records, for example, the Holt-Winter method implemented with time-dependent count data.","Barría-Sandoval, Claudia; Ferreira, Guillermo; Benz-Parra, Katherine; López-Flores, Pablo",PLoS One,95,14

He developed SARI, cytokines storm and septicaemia, treated with antibiotics, enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine, insulin, anti-hypertensives, put on ventilator, subsequently developed septicaemia, multi-organ failure and died. Two M-bands on serum capillary electrophoresis with presence IgG-&#954; on both the M-bands indicates a biclonal gammopathy of unknown significance in this patient. We conclude that like MGUS, early stage biclonal gammopathy, although rare, gets manifested with M-bands on plasma protein electrophoresis. It is probably due to high level of IL-6 associated with cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 that stimulate early stage dyscratic plasma cells. Such biclonal gammopathy might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and associated mortality.","Vashistha, Pooja; Gupta, Ajay Kumar; Arya, Mona; Kumar Singh, Vijay; Dubey, Abhishek; Chandra Koner, Bidhan",Clin Chim Acta,95,16

They owe their unique properties to a group of secondary metabolites known as phytocannabinoids, which are specific for this genus. Phytocannabinoids, and cannabinoids generally, can interact with cannabinoid receptors being part of the endocannabinoid system present in animals. Over the years a growing body of scientific evidence has been gathered, suggesting that these compounds have therapeutic potential. In this article, we review the classification of cannabinoids, the molecular mechanisms of their interaction with animal cells as well as their potential application in the treatment of human diseases. Specifically, we focus on the research concerning the anticancer potential of cannabinoids in preclinical studies, their possible use in cancer treatment and palliative medicine, as well as their influence on the immune system. We also discuss their potential as therapeutic agents in infectious, autoimmune, and gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases. We postulate that the currently ongoing and future clinical trials should be accompanied by research focused on the cellular and molecular response to cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts, which will ultimately allow us to fully understand the mechanism, potency, and safety profile of cannabinoids as single agents and as complementary drugs.","Sledzinski, Pawel; Nowak-Terpilowska, Agnieszka; Zeyland, Joanna",Int. j. mol. sci.

Despite the high relevance for public authorities to adequately address stockpiling behavior, empirical studies on the psychological underpinnings of toilet paper stockpiling are still scarce. In this study, we investigated the relation between personality traits, perceived threat of Covid-19, and stockpiling of toilet paper in an online survey (N = 996) across 22 countries. Results suggest that people who felt more threatened by Covid-19 stockpiled more toilet paper. Further, a predisposition towards Emotionality predicted the perceived threat of Covid-19 and affected stockpiling behavior indirectly. Finally, Conscientiousness was related to toilet paper stockpiling, such that individuals higher in Conscientiousness tended to stockpile more toilet paper. These results emphasize the importance of clear communication by public authorities acknowledging anxiety and, at the same time, transmitting a sense of control.","Garbe, Lisa; Rau, Richard; Toppe, Theo",PLoS One,95,21

Harm reduction centres are often linked to social services, mental health services, and infectious disease testing, in addition to tools and services that help to reduce the harms associated with injecting drugs. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services in four autonomous communities in Spain. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that employed a seven-section structured survey administered electronically to 20 centres in July 2020. Data from the most heavily affected months (March-June) in 2020 were compared to data from the same period in 2019. Averages were calculated with their ranges, rates, and absolute numbers. RESULTS: All 11 responding centres reported having had to adapt or modify their services during the Spanish state of alarm (14 March-21 June 2020). One centre reported complete closure for 2 months and four reported increases in their operating hours. The average number of service users across all centres decreased by 22% in comparison to the same period in the previous year and the average needle distribution decreased by 40% in comparison to 2019. Most centres reported a decrease in infectious disease testing rates (hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis) for March, April, and May in 2020 compared to the previous year. Reported deaths as a result of overdose did not increase during the state of alarm, but 2/11 (18%) centres reported an increase in overdose deaths immediately after finalisation of the state of alarm. CONCLUSION: Overall, Spanish harm reduction centres were able to continue operating and offering services by adjusting operating hours. The number of overall service users and needles distributed fell during the Spanish state of alarm lockdown period, suggesting that fewer clients accessed harm reduction services during this time, putting them at greater risk of reusing or sharing injecting equipment, overdosing, acquiring infectious diseases with decreased access to testing or discontinuing ongoing treatment such as methadone maintenance therapy, hepatitis C treatment, or antiretroviral therapy.","Picchio, Camila A; Valencia, Jorge; Doran, Jason; Swan, Tracy; Pastor, Marta; Martró, Elisa; Colom, Joan; Lazarus, Jeffrey V",Harm Reduct J,95,26

Indeed, due to such an increased attention, several software libraries and scientific tools have been developed to ease the access to epidemic modeling. However, only a handful of such resources were designed with the aim of providing a simple proxy for the study of the potential effects of public interventions (e.g., lockdown, testing, contact tracing). In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that, overcoming such limitations, allows to generate ""what if"" epidemic scenarios incorporating several public interventions (and their combinations). UTLDR is designed to be easy to use and capable to leverage information provided by stratified populations of agents (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns ). Moreover, the proposed framework is generic and not tailored for a specific epidemic phenomena: it aims to provide a qualitative support to understanding the effects of restrictions, rather than produce forecasts/explanation of specific data-driven phenomena.","Rossetti, Giulio; Milli, Letizia; Citraro, Salvatore; Morini, Virginia",J Intell Inf Syst,95,1

The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes. The receiver operating characteristic curves showed area under the curve values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively. iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer has shown highly accurate results for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies profile and can be considered an excellent tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.","Infantino, Maria; Grossi, Valentina; Lari, Barbara; Bambi, Riccardo; Perri, Alessandro; Manneschi, Matteo; Terenzi, Giovanni; Liotti, Irene; Ciotta, Giovanni; Taddei, Cristina; Benucci, Maurizio; Casprini, Patrizia; Veneziani, Francesca; Fabbri, Sergio; Pompetti, Adolfo; Manfredi, Mariangela",J. med. virol,95,1

To date, 18 species of virus from 12 genera have been demonstrated to be dependent on DDX3 for virulence. In addition, DDX3 has been shown to function within 7 of 10 subcellular regions that are involved in the metabolism of viruses. As such, due to its direct interaction with viral components across most or all stages of viral life cycles, DDX3 can be considered an excellent host target for pan-antiviral drug therapy and has been reported to be a possible broad-spectrum antiviral target. Along these lines, it has been demonstrated that treatment of virally infected cells with small molecule inhibitors of DDX3 blunts virion productions. On the other hand, DDX3 bolsters an innate immune response and viruses have evolved capacities to sequester or block DDX3, which dampens an innate immune response. Thus, enhancing DDX3 production or co-targeting direct viral products that interfere with DDX3's modulation of innate immunity would also diminish virion production. Here we review the evidence that supports the hypothesis that modulating DDX3's agonistic and antagonistic functions during viral infections could have an important impact on safely and efficiently subduing a broad-spectrum of viral infections.","Winnard, Paul T; Vesuna, Farhad; Raman, Venu",Antiviral Res,95,26

I don't want to die!”,14.969291,5.651494,2021,"Introduction: While access to health care is free in Australia, access to lung cancer treatments is not always affordable or timely, especially for a rare cancer patient like the author Diagnosed with ROS1+ NSCLC, the author had to crowdfund to pay for her first targeted therapy the price of which exceeded what most Australians could afford Acutely aware that her participation in a subsequent clinical trial is uncommon for someone with a similar minority background, the author seeks to explore the concept of patient experience in the context of diversity and inequity Patient experience is multidimensional and integrated The quality and safety of services provided, the costs incurred, and the outcomes achieved are all important facets of the patient experience [1] The ultimate goals of advocates are to achieve optimal patient experience by ensuring that patients’ needs are heard, and problems are resolved To do this effectively, advocates must understand the unmet needs of the patients they seek to represent However, lung cancer patient experience is not homogenous and is impacted by social determinants In Australia, lung cancer outcomes differ across socioeconomic status (SES), indigenous status and remoteness For example: (a) the incidence rates of lung cancer in 2010-14 were 27% higher in remote and very remote areas combined, compared to major Australian cities;(b) the mortality rate was highest in the lowest SES areas (SES1, 38 5 per 100,000 persons), compared to the highest SES areas (SES5, 20 1 per 100,000 persons);and (c) the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer in 2010-2014 was 8 5% for Indigenous Australians compared to 14 2% for non-Indigenous Australians [2] Health inequities exist both within and among countries [3], so the lung cancer patient experience would no doubt also differ within and between countries The aim of this presentation is to draw insights from the author’s lung cancer patient experience as well as patient anecdotes from other countries and continents Method: Three separate interviews were conducted through a cloud-based video conference service The interviewees were asked to share stories of lung cancer patient experience in their country, observations on key areas of improvement, and comments on how the global lung cancer community can support them Results: The interviewees comprised of two female lung cancer patients from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and a male lung cancer advocate from Nigeria Interview 1: Experience from The Netherlands: The insights of the patient advocate from the Netherlands were mostly very positive She described her experience of free access to healthcare, timely and free access to treatment, optimal level of nursing care, and integrated psychosocial services While there remains is a need to address stigma systematically and collaboratively, the interviewee observes that lung cancer care in the Netherlands may be held as a model for healthcare Interview 2: Experience from New Zealand: The anecdotes shared by the patient advocate from New Zealand somewhat differ While access to healthcare is free, most lung cancer patients are treated by general oncologists The patient advocate’s key area of concern is the limited access to biomarker testing, treatment options and clinicals trials She calls on the global lung cancer community to raise awareness about the lack of treatment options in New Zealand Interview 3: Experience from Nigeria: The third interview was with a former caregiver and advocate from Nigeria provided anecdotes and observations that were drastically different from the others Tragically, because healthcare costs are not subsidized and can be prohibitive, many people do not get diagnosed at all If diagnosed, a lung cancer patient would attend a general cancer clinic to see a general oncologist Treatment options are very limited as there is currently no access to any lung cancer biomarker testing, targeted therapy or immunotherapy There are currently no lung cancer clinical trials in Nigeria The interviewee descr bed feelings of sadness and despair when watching presentations on global lung cancer research and medical advancements He believes that the first step to tackle the dire position of lung cancer patients in Nigeria and Africa is to understand the current standard of lung cancer care in these respective areas He calls on the global community to provide support in that regard Conclusion: Lung cancer patient experience is not only multidimensional but also diverse The key insights drawn from the interviews are that, to ensure a comprehensive lung cancer patient experience, it is crucial that: (a) lung cancer advocates are aware and mindful of social determinants as well as issues that can significantly impact on patient outcomes, including inequity, accessibility, resourcing and poverty;(b) lung cancer researchers, clinicians and policy makers actively address disparities by engaging with a wide variety of patients and caregivers in their work;and (c) the lung cancer global community is sensitive to the impact of accelerating medical advancements on the widening gap of global health inequities, and ensure that all communication is appropriately respectful The reduction of inequities is a moral obligation [4] It may be difficult to comprehend in the year of the dawn of COVID-19, but it is time for us to advance beyond just tackling diseases It is our collective ethical responsibility to consider the whole patient experience in all aspects of lung cancer care, and to do so through the lenses of health inequities As the World Health Organisation states “[r]educing health inequities is… an ethical imperative Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale ” [5] Acknowledgements: My gratitude to Caleb Egwuenu, Lily Huang and Merel Hennink for generously sharing their time and experience

Parenting Health Initiative (SELPHI) provides expectant and parenting youth ages 16-24 in Philadelphia with supports to improve educational, social, and economic outcomes to shape their health and the health of their children. Phone, text, video-based, and social media communication technology is built in to SELPHI's program design to facilitate case management and connect clients to a broad referral network. Given the novelty of using information and communication technology (ICT) in case management, the reported lessons learned seek to give providers a specific and nuanced picture of ICT in case management. METHODS: In its initial 6-month implementation period, SELPHI's five case managers, called Navigators, served 59 clients. Data from feedback surveys and case records were collected from clients and Navigators. Data included client demographic characteristics, needs assessment, and contact records to inform continuous quality improvement (CQI). RESULTS: ICT's benefits included having multiple ways to connect to difficult-to-reach clients, the ability to be more responsive to clients, and the flexibility to address scheduling and transportation barriers. ICT's challenges are related to Navigators' boundary setting, limitations on rapport building, and data security considerations. CQI data are presented to illustrate the lessons learned. Text messages were the most prevalent ICT; phone calls were most successful in engaging clients. Clients' ICT preferences differed by purpose of communication. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that programs should understand the nuances of client contact preferences.

Despite demonstrating a beneficial role in the control and prevention of COVID-19, there are crucial concerns regarding the large-scale use of disinfectants and sanitizers, including the side effects on human and animal health along with harmful impacts exerted on the environment and ecological balance. This article discusses the roles of disinfectants and sanitizers in the control and prevention of the current pandemic and highlights updated disinfection techniques against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This article provides evidence of the deleterious effects of disinfectants and sanitizers exerted on humans, animals, and the environment as well as suggests mitigation strategies to reduce these effects. Additionally, potential technologies and approaches for the reduction of these effects and the development of safe, affordable, and effective disinfectants are discussed, particularly, eco-friendly technologies using nanotechnology and nanomedicine.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Kumar, Rakesh; Masand, Rupali; Rana, Jigyasa; Yatoo, Mohd Iqbal; Tiwari, Ruchi; Sharun, Khan; Mohapatra, Ranjan K; Natesan, Senthilkumar; Dhawan, Manish; Ahmad, Tauseef; Emran, Talha Bin; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Harapan, Harapan",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,95,29

We reviewed the chest CT scans, laboratory findings, and clinical records of 66 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to affiliated hospitals of Nanchang university, Nanchang, China, from Jan 21 to Feb 2, 2020. CT was used to evaluate the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Only 4 patients (4/66, 6%) claimed their exposure to COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The major symptoms were fever (60/66, 91%) and cough (37/66, 56%). The predominant features of lesion were scattered (43/66, 65%), bilateral (50/66, 76%), ground-glass opacity (64/66, 97%), and air bronchogram sign (47/66, 71%). Forty-eight patients (48/66, 73%) had more than two lobes involved. Right lower lobe (58/66, 88%) and left lower lobe (49/66, 74%) were most likely invaded. Twelve patients (12/66, 18%) had at least one comorbid condition. Pleural traction (29/66, 44%), crazy paving (15/66, 23%), interlobular septal thickening (11/66, 17%), and consolidation (7/66, 11%) were also observed. The typical radiology features of COVID-19 patients are scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lobes. Fever and cough are the major symptoms.

Here, we demonstrated that the symbiosis of Vigna radiata (mung bean) with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110 is determined by NopE, and this symbiosis is highly dependent on host genotype. NopE specifically triggered incompatibility with V. radiata cv. KPS2, but it promoted nodulation in other varieties of V. radiata, including KPS1. Interestingly, NopE1 and its paralogue NopE2, which exhibits calcium-dependent autocleavage, yield similar results in modulating KPS1 nodulation. Furthermore, NopE is required for early infection and nodule organogenesis in compatible plants. Evolutionary analysis revealed that NopE is highly conserved among bradyrhizobia and plant-associated endophytic and pathogenic bacteria. Our findings suggest that V. radiata and B. diazoefficiens USDA110 may use NopE to optimize their symbiotic interactions by reducing phytohormone-mediated ETI-type (PmETI) responses via salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis suppression.","Piromyou, Pongdet; Nguyen, Hien P; Songwattana, Pongpan; Boonchuen, Pakpoom; Teamtisong, Kamonluck; Tittabutr, Panlada; Boonkerd, Nantakorn; Alisha Tantasawat, Piyada; Göttfert, Michael; Okazaki, Shin; Teaumroong, Neung",Sci Rep,95,33

However, simulation studies have suggested an increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity for older individuals inoculated by house-bound children. This study examines whether the March 2020 lockdown in New York City (NYC) was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in neighborhoods with larger proportions of multigenerational households. MethodsWe obtained daily age-segmented COVID-19 hospitalization counts in each of 166 ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in NYC. Using Bayesian Poisson regression models that account for spatiotemporal dependencies between ZCTAs, as well as socioeconomic risk factors, we conducted a difference-in-differences study amongst ZCTA-level hospitalization rates from February 23 to May 2, 2020. We compared ZCTAs in the lowest quartile of multigenerational housing to other quartiles before and after the lockdown. FindingsAmong individuals over 55 years, the lockdown was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in ZCTAs with more multigenerational households. The greatest difference occurred three weeks after lockdown: Q2 vs. Q1: 54% increase (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 22 - 96%); Q3 vs. Q1: 48%, (17 - 89%); Q4 vs. Q1: 66%, (30 - 211%). After accounting for pandemic-related population shifts, a significant difference was observed only in Q4 ZCTAs: 37% (7 -76%). InterpretationBy increasing house-bound mixing across older and younger age groups, city-wide lockdown mandates imposed during the growth of COVID-19 cases may have inadvertently, but transiently, contributed to increased transmission in multigenerational households.

Cancer patients are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 and many have been or will be infected. Although an unfortunate minority will die from the infection, most will recover. This poses a challenge in which clinicians must weigh the benefits of initiation or resumption of antineoplastic therapy against the risks that antineoplastic treatment may worsen outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. A recent study of 423 patients at our institution found that patients in active cancer treatment who develop COVID-19 infection did not fare any worse than other hospitalized patients yet guidance as to who requires testing prior to antineoplastic therapy and when to resume therapy post-COVID diagnosis remains unknown. Our institution, therefore, commissioned a task force to help create guidelines for treating oncologists using available published literature. The taskforce focused on the ambulatory care testing guidelines only, as all inpatients receiving antineoplastic therapy are tested for COVID-19 prior to hospital admission. The guidelines focus solely on the safety and well-being of the individual patient undergoing antineoplastic therapy and are not designed to address infection control issues.","Reidy-Lagunes, Diane; Saltz, Leonard; Postow, Michael; Scordo, Michael; Moskowitz, Alison; Tew, William; Zamarin, Dmitriy; Redelman-Sidi, Gil",J. natl. cancer inst,95,6

Identifying themes in policy responses provides a framework for subsequent evaluations of the relationship between state policies and health service utilization.Methods: Between May and June 2020, we searched all Single State Agencies for Substance Abuse Services (SSA) websites for statements of SUD treatment policy responses to the pandemic. We conducted Iterative Categorization of policies for outpatient programs, opioid treatment programs, and other treatment settings to identify themes in policy responses.Results: We collected 220 documents from SSA websites from 45 states and Washington D.C. Eight specific themes emerged from our content analysis: delivery of pharmacological and non-pharmacological services, obtaining informed consent and documentation for remote services, conducting health assessments, facility operating procedures and staffing requirements, and permissible telehealth technology and billing protocols. Policy changes often mirrored federal guidance, for instance, by expanding methadone take-home options for opioid treatment programs. The extent and nature of policy changes varied across jurisdictions, including telehealth technology requirements and staffing flexibility.Conclusion: States have made significant policy changes to SUD treatment policies during COVID-19, particularly regarding telehealth and facilitation of remote care. Understanding these changes could help policymakers prioritize guidance during the pandemic and for future health crises. Impacts of policies on disparate treatment populations, including those with limited technological access, should be considered.","Andraka-Christou, Barbara; Bouskill, Kathryn; Haffajee, Rebecca L; Randall-Kosich, Olivia; Golan, Matthew; Totaram, Rachel; Gordon, Adam J; Stein, Bradley D",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,95,1

To quickly identify the pathogen, we designed and screened primer sets, and established a sensitive and specific qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV 2; the lower limit of detection (LOD) was 14.8 (95% CI: 9.8-21) copies per reaction. We combined this qRT-PCR assay with an automatic integration system for nucleic acid extraction and amplification, thereby establishing an automatic integrated gene detection system (AIGS) for SARS-CoV 2. Cross reactive analysis performed in 20 other respiratory viruses and 37 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% specificity of the assay. Using two fold diluted SARS-CoV 2 culture, the LOD of AIGS was confirmed to be 365 copies/ml (95% CI: 351-375), which was Comparable to that of conventional q RT-PCR (740 copies/ml, 95% CI: 689-750). Clinical performances of AIGS assay were assessed in 266 suspected COVID-19 clinical respiratory tract samples tested in parallel with a commercial kit. The clinical sensitivity of the AIGS test was 97.62% (95% CI: 0.9320-0.9951) based on the commercial kit test result, and concordance analysis showed a high agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the two assays, Pearson R was 0.9623 (95% CI: 0.9523-0.9703). The results indicated that this AIGS could be used for rapid detection of SARS-CoV 2. With the advantage of simple operation and less time consuming, AIGS could be suitable for SARS-CoV2 detection in primary medical institutions, thus would do a great help to improve detection efficiency and control the spread of COVID-19.","Li, Yuchang; Li, Jing; Zhang, Ying; Dai, Lizhong; Li, Lin; Liu, Juan; Zhang, Sen; Wu, Xiaoyan; Hu, Yi; Qin, Chenfeng; Jiang, Tao; Kang, Xiaoping",Emerg Microbes Infect,95,20

Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). METHODS: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. RESULTS: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. CONCLUSION: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.","Bikson, Marom; Hanlon, Colleen A; Woods, Adam J; Gillick, Bernadette T; Charvet, Leigh; Lamm, Claus; Madeo, Graziella; Holczer, Adrienn; Almeida, Jorge; Antal, Andrea; Ay, Mohammad Reza; Baeken, Chris; Blumberger, Daniel M; Campanella, Salvatore; Camprodon, Joan A; Christiansen, Lasse; Loo, Colleen; Crinion, Jennifer T; Fitzgerald, Paul; Gallimberti, Luigi; Ghobadi-Azbari, Peyman; Ghodratitoostani, Iman; Grabner, Roland H; Hartwigsen, Gesa; Hirata, Akimasa; Kirton, Adam; Knotkova, Helena; Krupitsky, Evgeny; Marangolo, Paola; Nakamura-Palacios, Ester M; Potok, Weronika; Praharaj, Samir K; Ruff, Christian C; Schlaug, Gottfried; Siebner, Hartwig R; Stagg, Charlotte J; Thielscher, Axel; Wenderoth, Nicole; Yuan, Ti-Fei; Zhang, Xiaochu; Ekhtiari, Hamed",Brain Stimul,95,21

Scientists are trying to map the pattern of the transmission of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Many countries are in the phase of lockdown in the globe. In this paper we predict about the effect of coronavirus COVID-19 and give a sneak peak when it will reduce the transmission rate in the world via mathematical modelling. In this research work our study is based on extensions of the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) family of compartmental models and later we observe the new model changes into (SEIR) without changing its physical meanings. The stability analysis of the coronavirus depends on changing of its basic reproductive ratio. The progress rate of the virus in the critically infected cases and the recovery rate have major roles to control this epidemic. The impact of social distancing, lockdown of the country, self-isolation, home quarantine and the wariness of global public health system have significant influence on the parameters of the model system that can alter the effect of recovery rates, mortality rates and active contaminated cases with the progression of time in the real world.

However, the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents’ mental health might be moderated by their existing psychological resources. The present study sought to investigate whether the relationship between adolescents’ perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was alleviated by their character strengths. A total of 617 adolescents were recruited and completed the online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that adolescents’ perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly positively correlated with their depression symptoms. Character strengths were significantly negatively correlated with adolescents’ perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms. Moreover, the moderating effect of character strengths on the relationship between adolescents’ perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was significant. Therefore, adolescents’ character strengths as a protective factor could buffer the effect of perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic on their depression symptoms and contribute to maintaining their mental health.","Liu, Qianwen Wang Zhenhong",Personality and Individual Differences,95,1

We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1.

However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious ‘shortcuts’. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired ‘shortcuts’ learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","DeGrave, A.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with COVID-19-related concerns, precautionary behaviors, and willingness to return to activity. METHODS: National survey data were obtained from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, an ongoing cross-sectional weekly survey. The sample was provided by Lucid, a web-based market research platform. Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) COVID-19-related concerns, (2) precautionary behaviors, and (3) willingness to return to activity. Key independent variables included age, gender, race or ethnicity, education, household income, political party support, religion, news consumption, number of medication prescriptions, perceived COVID-19 status, and timing of peak COVID-19 infections by state. RESULTS: The data included 125,508 responses from web-based surveys conducted over 20 consecutive weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (comprising approximately 6250 adults per week), between March 19 and August 5, 2020, approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board for analysis.

However, changes in pollutant concentrations are also affected by chemical transformation and meteorology. Decreases in concentrations were also not as obvious in Beijing when compared with Hubei Province, where lockdown was especially strict. Declines in concentrations between 2019 and 2020 are evident for both NO2 (37.0 to 26.2 µg m-3) and SO2 (5.86 to 4.15 µg m-3), but there was little evidence of change for PM2.5 (50.0 to 53.8 µg m-3) and CO (0.71 to 0.74 mg m-3). Despite this, Fourier analysis revealed that the weekly cycle of PM2.5 evident in 2019 was not apparent in 2020. In 2019, CO showed both diurnal and weekly signals, but these were absent under the restrictions of 2020.

When PM enters into a respiratory tract, the first body tissues to be directly exposed are the cells of respiratory tissues and pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a pivotal component to modulate surface tension of alveoli during respiration. Many studies have proved that PM would interact with pulmonary surfactant to affect the alveolar activity, and meanwhile, pulmonary surfactant would be adsorbed to the surface of PM to change the toxic effect of PM. This review focuses on recent studies of the interactions between micro/nanoparticles (synthesized and environmental particles) and pulmonary surfactant (natural surfactant and its models), as well as the health effects caused by PM through a few significant aspects, such as surface properties of PM, including size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, shape, chemical nature, etc. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that PM leads to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis, and cancerization in living bodies. By providing a comprehensive picture of PM-surfactant interaction, this review will benefit both researchers for further studies and policy-makers for setting up more appropriate regulations to reduce the adverse effects of PM on public health.","Wang, Feifei; Liu, Jifang; Zeng, Hongbo",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,95,16

Material and method: A retrospective analysis of non-enhanced computer tomographic scans has been performed in the main center for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Prince Hamzah Hospital for those scanned from 13th of March 2020 to 13th of May 2020. Included scans were routinely performed during 24-hs of admission apart from having respiratory complaint. CT protocol included non-enhanced 1 mm slice thickness by Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands).All computer tomographic scans were reviewed by two senior radiologists with more than 8 years of experience each and senior registrar.Several factors have been thoroughly studied including patient age, gender, positive versus negative pulmonary findings, laterality of lung involvement, lobar distribution, pattern of pulmonary changes on initial and follow-up scans. Results: The total number of patients evaluated was 302. There were 188 men and 114 women studied. Among the totally studied 302 cases; 181 cases (59.9 %) showed no pulmonary changes.Positive findings were present in 121 patients with a total number of 191 computer tomographic scans including initial and follow-up scans. Positive findings were present in 51 female and 70 male patients (age range, 12-87 years; mean age ± standard deviation, 46.1 ± 16.5).Bilateral disease was more frequently encountered presented in 86 cases (71.1 %), while unilateral disease showed two times more predilection for the right lung compared to the left. The incidence of lobar involvement in descending order: right lower (75.2 %), left lower (71.9 %), right upper (62.8 %), left upper (60.3 %) and right middle (50.4 %). The incidence of the affected lobes on the initial scans were as follow: one lobe (24 %), two lobes (10.7 %), three lobes (9.1 %), four lobes (16.5 %) five lobes (36.4 %). In cases with single lobar involvement (24 %); the left upper and right middle lobes showed lowest incidence of involvement accounting for 10.3 % & 13.8 %, respectively; on the other hand, in cases with four lobar involvement (16.5 %); the right middle lobe was most commonly spared in two third of cases (63.2 %).Several initial patterns of the pulmonary changes resulting from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were present with a descending order; ground-glass pattern (96.7 %), lenticular pattern (32.2 %), Halo sign (15.7 % %), rounded (14.9 %), nodular (10.7 %), ground-glass with consolidation (8.3 %), tree-in-bud (1.7 %) and pleural effusion (1.7 %). Pathologically-enlarged lymph node was not a feature of COVID-19.The total number of patients with positive findings having follow-up scans was 57 including single (45 patients) versus two (12 patients) follow-up scans. Initial follow up scans showed regression and progression of the pulmonary changes in 35 and 22 patients, respectively.A remarkable pattern was seen in almost all regressed cases that showed patchy reticular pattern changes with septal thickening which was referred to ""pulmonary synapses"" (34 patients) with only one patient showed complete resolution of the parenchymal changes. Patterns seen in progressed cases were lenticular ground-glass (63.6 %) vs patchy ground-glass (36.4 %) patterns. Conclusion: Computer tomographic scan of the chest is a principal diagnostic measure for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pulmonary changes showed more propensity being bilateral disease and affecting the lower lobes, while the right middle lobe was the least likely involvement. Several pattern of pulmonary changes can be seen on initial scans including ground glass, consolidation, Halo sign, lenticular, nodular, pleural effusion and tree-in-bud patterns. The tree-in-bud is first-time described pattern of COVID-19 in the current article and thought to be an excluding criterion. In follow-up scans; the lenticular and patchy ground-glass patterns were present in cases with disease progression, compared with ""pulmonary synapses"" pattern encountered in cases with disease regression.","Albtoush, Omar M; Al-Shdefat, Rawan B; Al-Akaileh, Alabed",Eur J Radiol Open,95,24

Patients' physical activity decreased from week 7 to week 11 (10.9% vs. 6.9%; RRR 36.7%; P<0.0001) with an increase between week 11 and week 16 (6.9% vs. 8.5%; RRR 18.8%; P<0.0001). Patients' perceptions about physical activity showed a very low correlation with remote monitoring-assessed physical activity levels (r2=0.035). Conclusions: Telemedicine and remote monitoring characterized the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on vital signs and physical activity levels of heart failure patients, playing a crucial role in the prediction of heart failure worsening during circumstances discouraging outpatient visits.","Bertagnin, Enrico; Greco, Antonio; Bottaro, Giuseppe; Zappulla, Paolo; Romanazzi, Imma; Daniela Russo, Maria; Lo Presti, Marco; Valenti, Noemi; Sollano, Giuseppe; Calvi, Valeria",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,95,26

However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this article , we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs. Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100-160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower-risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6-3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0-33.7). We therefore find a 50-person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8-99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3-99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.","Manheim, David; WiÈ©cek, Witold; Schmit, Virginia; Morrison, Josh",Risk Anal,95,4

We discuss 'beneficial' exposomes (green/natural outdoor spaces, sun exposure, healthy diets and features of built environments) that could synergise with physical activity to prevent metabolic dysfunction, particularly that related to lifestyle diseases of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity may also reduce the capacity of some adverse exposomes, specifically those with significant levels of air pollution, to contribute towards metabolic dysfunction. Other exposomes, such as those experienced during pandemics (including COVID-19), potentially limit opportunities for physical activity, and there may be unexpected combined effects of physical activity with other infections (e.g. adenovirus-36) on metabolic health.

SETTING: CINER Rehabilitation Center. METHODS: We administered and video recorded the Spanish version of the Berg Balance Scale to 20 incomplete SCI patients. Two raters scored the videos on two different occasions at least three weeks apart. We used intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a confidence interval (CI) of 95% to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-rater (test-retest) reliability of the BBS total scores. RESULTS: ICC values for inter-rater reliability at first and second observation were 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-1.00), respectively. Intra-rater ICC for rater 1 was 1.00 (95% CI 1.00-1.00) and for rater 2 was 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00). All of them were excellent.

He presented initially with vague gastrointerestinal symptoms and later a cough. His atypical presentation led to a delay in diagnosis, but ultimately he was isolated and tested. On confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19, the patient was isolated in a separate hospital with a dedicated medical care team. All contacts were traced and quarantined. The patient's respiratory status deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antivirals, antibiotics, and intensive supportive care. He required intubation and was given a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin to modulate his likely aberrant immune response.

In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.","Hacimusalar, Yunus; Kahve, Aybeniz Civan; Yasar, Alisan Burak; Aydin, Mehmet Sinan",J Psychiatr Res,95,1

However, only a few cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate a case of concomitant GBS with COVID-19 in Colombia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to a teaching hospital in Barranquilla, Colombia with a history of progressive general weakness with lower limb dominance. Previous symptoms such as ageusia, anosmia and intense headache were reported. Upon admission, facial diplegia, quadriparesis with lower extremity predominance and Medical Research Council muscular strength of 2/5 in the lower limbs and 4/5 in the upper limbs were reported. During clinical evolution, due to general areflexia, hypertensive emergency and progressive diaphragmatic weakness, the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed protein-cytological dissociation and the GBS diagnosis was confirmed via a nerve conduction and electromyography test. With regard to the symptoms before hospitalisation, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was performed with positive results in the second test. The patient was managed with supportive care and was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few cases of COVID-19 with GBS have been reported. Different subtypes have been previously identified, such as Miller-Fisher syndrome and dysautonomic GBS with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigated the first confirmed case of COVID-19 with concomitant GBS in Colombia. In patients with GBS, several viral and bacterial pathogens have been found in case-control studies but the factors that induce the immune-mediated destruction of the nerve tissues have not been determined.

Recently, an association between COVID-19 and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease has been proposed. We report on a patient with recurrence of anti-GBM disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: The 31-year-old woman had a past medical history of anti-GBM disease, first diagnosed 11 years ago, and a first relapse 5 years ago. She was admitted with severe dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates and acute on chronic kidney injury. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive with a high cycle threshold. Anti-GBM autoantibodies were undetectable. A kidney biopsy revealed necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear deposits of IgG, IgM and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane, confirming a recurrence of anti-GBM disease. She was treated with steroids, plasma exchange and two doses of rituximab. Pulmonary disease resolved, but the patient remained dialysis-dependent. We propose that pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 caused exposure of alveolar basement membranes leading to the production of high avidity autoantibodies by long-lived plasma cells, resulting in severe pulmonary renal syndrome.

We identify viral protein phosphorylation and define phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways are activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathways targetable by approved drugs. The inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant.

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. METHODS: Cross-sectional 'snapshot' survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. FINDINGS: Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2.0% (23/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35.70 (IQR:32.42-37.57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 1.38-8.67; pâ¯=â¯0.008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. INTERPRETATION: The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling.

This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase® registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017-2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017-2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017-2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005). The in-hospital observed mortality and predicted mortality during the pandemic period were not different compared to the non-pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: During this first wave of COVID-19 in France, and more specifically during lockdown there was a significant reduction of patients admitted to designated trauma centers. Despite the reallocation and reorganization of medical resources this reduction prevented the saturation of the trauma rescue chain and has allowed maintaining a high quality of care for trauma patients.","Moyer, Jean-Denis; James, Arthur; Gakuba, Clément; Boutonnet, Mathieu; Angles, Emeline; Rozenberg, Emmanuel; Bardon, Jean; Clavier, Thomas; Legros, Vincent; Werner, Marie; Mathais, Quentin; Ramonda, Véronique; Le Minh, Pierre; Berthelot, Yann; Colas, Clélia; Pottecher, Julien; Gauss, Tobias",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,95,24

Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders - and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder - seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Kunas, Stefanie Lydia; Wyka, Sarah; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Plag, Jens; Asselmann, Eva; Ströhle, Andreas",J Anxiety Disord,95,20

Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations: Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.","Southall, Emma; Tildesley, Michael J; Dyson, Louise",PLoS Comput Biol,95,16

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of changes in social media use among children aged 12 to 18 years who were at risk for excessive use of social media during the pandemic period with anxiety and a sense of loneliness. Material and Methods: The study population consisted of children aged 12 to 18 years and living in Turkey. Participants completed the COVID-19 information form, the Social Media Disorder Scale, the Loneliness Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: This study evaluated the data of 1,142 patients. The mean age of the participants was 15.6 years, and 63.2% were females. Among the participants, 63.8% stated that they knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19 in their family or close environment, and 7.1% stated that they were diagnosed with CO-VID-19. Furthermore, 46.4% stated that what they learned from the media increased their anxiety, and 60.4% stated that their academic success decreased during the pandemic period. In the model, STAI (B: 0.166 p: 0.001), age (B: 0.397, p: 0.001), and UCLA loneliness (B: 0.150, p: 0.001) were observed to predict social media addiction. Discussion: The present study has revealed factors predicting an increase in social media addiction in this period, during which the use of social media by adolescents in the high-risk group for social media addiction has increased. Taking the necessary measures to reduce the risks and increase the protective factors is the most important way to protect adolescents’ mental health in times of difficult life conditions.","Kılınçel, Ş Muratdağı G.",Annals of Clinical and Analytical Medicine,95,24

Here, we investigate whether inclusion of cGAMP within viral vaccine vectors enhances their immunogenicity. We immunise mice with virus-like particles (VLPs) containing HIV-1 Gag and the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G). cGAMP loading of VLPs augments CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. It also increases VLP- and VSV-G-specific antibody titres in a STING-dependent manner and enhances virus neutralisation, accompanied by increased numbers of T follicular helper cells. Vaccination with cGAMP-loaded VLPs containing haemagglutinin induces high titres of influenza A virus neutralising antibodies and confers protection upon virus challenge. This requires cGAMP inclusion within VLPs and is achieved at markedly reduced cGAMP doses. Similarly, cGAMP loading of VLPs containing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein enhances Spike-specific antibody titres. cGAMP-loaded VLPs are thus an attractive platform for vaccination.","Chauveau, Lise; Bridgeman, Anne; Tan, Tiong K; Beveridge, Ryan; Frost, Joe N; Rijal, Pramila; Pedroza-Pacheco, Isabela; Partridge, Thomas; Gilbert-Jaramillo, Javier; Knight, Michael L; Liu, Xu; Russell, Rebecca A; Borrow, Persephone; Drakesmith, Hal; Townsend, Alain R; Rehwinkel, Jan",EMBO Rep,95,24

Although its psychometric properties have been extensively studied, one critical piece of information that is missing from the literature is evidence of its longitudinal factorial invariance-that is, whether the RAS measures the same recovery construct across time. The authors empirically tested the longitudinal factorial invariance assumption for the RAS. METHODS: Structural equation modeling was used to test the longitudinal factorial invariance of the RAS with data longitudinally obtained at three time points from 167 people with severe mental illness. RESULTS: The longitudinal factorial invariance assumption was supported (i.e., configural, metric, partial scalar, factor variance and covariance invariance).

There is a higher incidence in some regions and countries, especially where close association exists between growing numbers of cattle (the major source of Mycobacterium bovis) and people, many suffering from poverty, and where dairy products are consumed unpasteurised. More attention needs to be focused on possible increased zTB incidence resulting from growth in dairy production globally and increased demand in low income countries in particular. Evidence of new zoonotic mycobacterial strains in South Asia and Africa (e.g. M. orygis), warrants urgent assessment of prevalence, potential drivers and risk in order to develop appropriate interventions. Control of M. bovis infection in cattle through detect and cull policies remain the mainstay of reducing zTB risk, whilst in certain circumstances animal vaccination is proving beneficial. New point of care diagnostics will help to detect animal infections and human cases.

264940,264940,264940,Acceptance and Intake of COVID-19 Vaccines among Older Germans,14.963748,5.374624,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial reduction in gastrointestinal endoscopies, creating a backlog of procedures. We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 9·5% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (84·5% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775-181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398-130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564-215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 15·4%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 43·8%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 82·5% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 µg haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

However, accumulated facts dispute this version of events. The first infected patient appeared in September in the United States, in December - in France. in November-December pneumonia of similar severity raged in Russia. It is difficult to explain numerous outbreaks of simultaneous contagions in isolated staffs, including military garrisons. In most of healthy adults' antibodies to coronavirus are found. The most of infected patients have no symptoms of disease. To explain these paradoxes ecological hypothesis is proposed - humanity and coronaviruses have been interacting evolutionarily for thousands years in system of biogeocenosis, periodically confronting under influence of cyclical ecological processes. The purpose of study is to investigate relationship between mortality of acute out-of-hospital pneumonia, coronavirus ones included, and cyclical fluctuations of environmental conditions. The primary material was obtained from data of Rosstat, international information bases, results of scientific studies. The classic methods of medical statistics were applied. The summer solstice (June) was used as reference point for estimating dynamics of monthly mortality in 2015-2020. The analysis of dynamics of mortality of pneumonia averaged for 2015-2020 revealed three epidemic waves with peaks in October, January, and March. Such cyclical pattern was consistently reproduced for particular years in 2015-2020. The first wave always was the lowest one. When the second wave exceeds the third one, increase in mortality in February and March was the smallest one. The greatest epidemic losses were established at the plateau. In 2020, the rate of coronavirus infection in the world coincides with the established cyclicity. The stable reproducibility of three peaks of mortality in same months testifies their regular character. The cause of all this may be the cyclicity of ecological interactions between coronaviruses and human population.","Gundarov, I A",Probl Sotsialnoi Gig Zdravookhranenniiai Istor Med,95,26

An unprecedented amount of over 14 billion USD moved into DeFi projects offering trading, loans and insurance. But its growth has also drawn the attention of malicious actors. Many projects were exploited as quickly as they launched and millions of USD were lost. While many developers understand integer overflows and reentrancy attacks, security threats to the DeFi ecosystem are more complex and still poorly understood. In this paper we provide the first overview of in-the-wild DeFi security incidents. We observe that many of these exploits are market attacks, weaponizing weakly implemented business logic in one protocol with credit provided by another to inflate appropriations. Rather than misusing individual protocols, attackers increasingly use DeFi's strength of permissionless composability against itself. By providing the first holistic analysis of real-world security incidents within the nascent financial ecosystem DeFi is, we hope to inform threat modeling in decentralized cryptoeconomic initiatives in the years ahead.","Oosthoek, Kris",,95,26

The COVID 19 pandemic caused additional fall to crude oil price expectedly, given the dynamics of demand and supply. Following world economic shut down, crude oil prices dipped to all time low. Global economies were heavily impacted by the crude oil price drop and Africa, which is known to be at the top of receiving end of fluctuating oil prices historically, once more suffered negative consequences. Africa energy security and sustainability becomes paramount following the continued negative impact of global oil prices change on the continent. Issues with crude oil transportation, storage and accessibility in Africa remains significant. Nigeria, whose economy is predominantly dependent on revenue from crude oil, witnessed another round of devaluation of the naira and with inflation in the negative direction due to the collapse in oil price. This paper focused on global energy security and sustainability in Africa. It explored the windows of opportunities in areas of transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and in advanced world and how Africa can adopt such methods. It looked at how Africa can take advantage of the advanced technology deployed in conventional petroleum development globally and in unconventional areas like nuclear, solar and wind energy. The results considered how Nigeria can be preserved from negative oil prices and the technologies available to boost her petroleum industry, particularly developments of unconventional resources beyond 2025 and sustainability of energy security within the polity. Suitable alternative and the sustainability of refined petroleum transportation and distribution is critical with reference to energy security in Africa.","Amadi, C. S.; Onuoha, K. M.; Onwuka, J.

In a representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 5,010), this research tested whether COVID-19 financial hardship was associated with higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation (supported), and whether the reasoned action framework could usefully predict help-seeking intentions in this context (supported). The reasoned action framework explained 36% of the variance in help-seeking intentions in the U.S. population and identified injunctive norm (social support) as primary determinant of intention. Neither suicidal ideation, COVID-19 financial hardship, or self-stigma of seeking help influenced determinants of help-seeking. Future research should test injunctive norm as causal predictor of help-seeking in the U.S. population to usefully inform effective help-seeking campaigns, particularly among those who have experienced COVID-19 financial hardship. Additionally, effective dissemination strategies for help-seeking campaigns should be tested and identified, such as broader targeted approaches as well as intentional mis-targeting techniques.","Lueck, Jennifer A",Psychiatry Res,95,16

This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, Uâ=â4.932, Pâ=â0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, &#967;â=â9.291, Pâ=â0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, Uâ=â2.057, Pâ=â0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, &#967;â=â5.611, Pâ=â0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, Uâ=â4.030, Pâ=â0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group.

CRF and Ucn1 activate both CRF1 and CRF2, while Ucn2 and Ucn3 activate selectively CRF2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CRF, Ucn1, Ucn2 and Ucn3 on the hippocampal acetylcholine release through which they may modulate cognitive functions, including attention, learning and memory. In this purpose male Wistar rats were used, their hippocampus was isolated, dissected, incubated, superfused and stimulated electrically. The hippocampal slices were first pretreated with selective CRF1 antagonist antalarmin or selective CRF2 antagonist astressin2B, and then treated with non-selective CRF1 agonists, CRF or Ucn1, and selective CRF2 agonists, Ucn2 or Ucn3. The hippocampal acetylcholine release was increased significantly by CRF and Ucn1 and decreased significantly by Ucn2 and Ucn3. The increasing effect of CRF and Ucn1 was reduced significantly by antalarmin, but not astressin2B. In contrast, the decreasing effect of Ucn2 and Ucn3 was reversed significantly by the selective CRF2, but not the selective CRF1 antagonist. Our results demonstrate that CRF and Ucn1 stimulate the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF1, whereas Ucn2 and Ucn3 inhibit the hippocampal acetylcholine release through CRF2. Therefore, the present study suggests the existence of two apparently opposing CRF systems in the hippocampus, through which CRF and the urocortins might modulate cholinergic activity and thereby cognitive functions.","Pintér, Dávid; Balangó, Beáta; Simon, Balázs; Palotai, Miklós; Csabafi, Krisztina; Dobó, Éva; Ibos, Katalin Eszter; Bagosi, Zsolt",Neuropeptides,95,20

The competition of approaches is expressed in the confrontation between supporters of energy based on renewable sources and supporters of traditional energy resources. A comparative analysis of changes in the energy sector, depending on the prevalence of a particular approach to energy development, shows that external conditions play a key role in promoting the energy strategy. The strategy of priority development of ""green"" energy carried out under Barack Obama could not be realized because of the shale boom. As a result, many companies working with renewable energy sources did not stand up to the competition. The opposite approach of Donald Trump's focus on developing traditional energy resources to ensure US energy security and to increase jobs has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has virtually nullified the US administration's efforts under this approach. The current concept of President J. Biden is aimed at continuing the strategy of Barack Obama for the development of ""green"" energy in the United States. Proponents of this concept hope for the possibility of its at least partial implementation in the absence of a shale boom. The lifting of the embargo on the export of American oil has led to an increase in oil supplies abroad. As of 2018, the United States has overtaken Saudi Arabia in terms of oil and gas exports, taking a leading position in the global oil market. In 2019-2020, the United States retained the first place in the world in oil production. This article examines the conceptual approaches of American administrations to the issue of energy policy and analyzes the statistical data that characterize the traditional and ""clean energy"" industries. An important factor is the degree of influence of the US energy policy on global oil prices. To analyze this issue, this research uses curved regression equations to assess the impact of US energy policy on world oil prices under the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The results of the correlation show that a more effective interaction between the variables was carried out during the presidency of Barack Obama, when Exports of Crude Oil influenced the price dynamics of oil quotes with an inverse relationship. With the arrival of the Biden administration, the strategy started under Obama in favor of developing clean energy was continued. In the context of the spread of covid-19, the growth of crisis phenomena in the national economy, the growth of production costs in the oil and gas industry, and the fall in the world energy prices, the development of green energy can have a certain effect, given the Biden administration's approach to energy development. The subsequent actions of the Biden administration may offset Trump's efforts to develop traditional energy to strengthen the economic potential of the United States and strengthen the position of American companies in the global oil market.

OBJECTIVE.­: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. DESIGN.­: All suspected cases of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center in Wuhan from January 20 to March 19, 2020, were included. Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS.­: Twenty-seven pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) with laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 neonates born to the 23 women in late pregnancy were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13 of 27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11 of 27), cough (9 of 27), and vomiting (1 of 27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.5% (22 of 27) of patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography scan, whereas 1 patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest computed tomography. One mother developed severe pneumonia 3 days after her delivery. No maternal or perinatal death occurred. Moreover, 1 early preterm newborn born to a mother with the complication of premature rupture of fetal membranes, highly suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, was SARS-CoV-2 negative after repeated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Statistical differences were observed between the groups of women in early and late pregnancy with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS.­: No major complications were reported among the studied cohort, though 1 serious case and 1 perinatal infection were observed.

The HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) system is a platform used extensively in studies of cell entry, screening of novel entry inhibitors, assessing the phenotypes of clinically observed E1 and E2 glycoproteins and, most pertinently, in characterizing neutralizing antibody breadth induced upon vaccination and natural infection in patients. Nonetheless, some patient-derived clones produce pseudoparticles that are either non-infectious or exhibit infectivity too low for meaningful phenotyping. The mechanisms governing whether any particular clone produces infectious pseudoparticles are poorly understood. Here we show that endogenous expression of CD81, an HCV receptor and a cognate-binding partner of E2, in producer HEK 293T cells is detrimental to the infectivity of recovered HCVpp for most strains. Many HCVpp clones exhibited increased infectivity or had their infectivity rescued when they were produced in 293T cells CRISPR/Cas9 engineered to ablate CD81 expression (293TCD81KO). Clones made in 293TCD81KO cells were antigenically very similar to their matched counterparts made parental cells and appear to honour the accepted HCV entry pathway. Deletion of CD81 did not appreciably increase the recovered titres of soluble E2 (sE2). However, we did, unexpectedly, find that monomeric sE2 made in 293T cells and Freestyle 293-F (293-F) cells exhibit important differences. We found that 293-F-produced sE2 harbours mostly complex-type glycans whilst 293T-produced sE2 displays a heterogeneous mixture of both complex-type glycans and high-mannose or hybrid-type glycans. Moreover, sE2 produced in 293T cells is antigenically superior; exhibiting increased binding to conformational antibodies and the large extracellular loop of CD81. In summary, this work describes an optimal cell line for the production of HCVpp and reveals that sE2 made in 293T and 293-F cells are not antigenic equals. Our findings have implications for functional studies of E1E2 and the production of candidate immunogens.","Kalemera, Mphatso D; Capella-Pujol, Joan; Chumbe, Ana; Underwood, Alexander; Bull, Rowena A; Schinkel, Janke; Sliepen, Kwinten; Grove, Joe",J. gen. virol,95,24

Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance.AimsThis study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.MethodsWe extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation. A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay. Secondary attack rate was also estimated.ResultsThe empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81). Containment delay increased significantly over time. Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay. The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation. The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.

It can lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic crisis like COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a long-term restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic cost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to manage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for COVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The social distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently accessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community mobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven economic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the search of the efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic control problem. We propose to solve the problem with a deep-learning approach. By applying our framework to the US data, we empirically examine the efficiency of the US social distancing policy and offer recommendations generated from the algorithm.","Chen, Kexin; Pun, Chi Seng; Wong, Hoi Ying",,95,0

Here, we use mobility and case data to quantify how coordinated exit strategies could delay continental resurgence and limit community transmission of COVID-19. We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe.

However, it was heterogeneous in the existing studies. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively summarize the VST of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, CNKI, CSTJ, and Wanfang up to October 25, 2020, for studies that reported VSTs of SARS-CoV-2. Pooled estimates and 95% CIs for the VSTs were calculated using log-transformed data. The VSTs in SARS-CoV-2 infections based on different demographic and clinical characteristics, treatments and specimens were stratified by subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 35 studies involving 3,385 participants met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean VST was 16.8 days (95% CI: 14.8-19.4, I 2 = 99.56%) in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The VST was significantly longer in symptomatic infections (19.7 days, 95% CI: 17.2-22.7, I 2 = 99.34%) than in asymptomatic infections (10.9 days, 95% CI: 8.3-14.3, I 2 = 98.89%) (P < 0.05). The VST was 23.2 days (95% CI: 19.0-28.4, I 2 = 99.24%) in adults, which was significantly longer than that in children (9.9 days, 95% CI: 8.1-12.2, I 2 = 85.74%) (P < 0.05). The VST was significantly longer in persons with chronic diseases (24.2 days, 95% CI: 19.2-30.2, I 2 = 84.07%) than in those without chronic diseases (11.5 days, 95% CI: 5.3-25.0, I 2 = 82.11%) (P < 0.05). Persons receiving corticosteroid treatment (28.3 days, 95% CI: 25.6-31.2, I 2 = 0.00%) had a longer VST than those without corticosteroid treatment (16.2 days, 95% CI: 11.5-22.5, I 2 = 92.27%) (P = 0.06). The VST was significantly longer in stool specimens (30.3 days, 95% CI: 23.1-39.2, I 2 = 92.09%) than in respiratory tract specimens (17.5 days, 95% CI: 14.9-20.6, I 2 = 99.67%) (P < 0.05). Conclusions: A longer VST was found in symptomatic infections, infected adults, persons with chronic diseases, and stool specimens.","Yan, Danying; Zhang, Xiaobao; Chen, Can; Jiang, Daixi; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Zhou, Yuqing; Huang, Chenyang; Zhou, Yiyi; Guan, Zhou; Ding, Cheng; Chen, Lu; Lan, Lei; Fu, Xiaofang; Wu, Jie; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Shigui",Front Public Health,95,1

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), making RdRp an excellent target for antiviral agents. RdRp is a multi-subunit complex composed of 3 viral proteins named nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 that ensure the ~30 kb RNA genome's transcription and replication. The main strategies employed so far for the overproduction of RdRp consist of expressing and purifying the three subunits separately before assembling the complex in vitro. However, nsp12 shows limited solubility in bacterial expression systems and is often produced in insect cells. Here, we describe an alternative strategy to co-express the full SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in E. coli, using a single plasmid. Characterization of the purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shows that it forms a complex with the expected (nsp7)(nsp8)2(nsp12) stoichiometry. RNA polymerization activity was measured using primer-extension assays showing that the purified enzyme is functional. The purification protocol can be achieved in one single day, surpassing in speed all other published protocols. Our construct is ideally suited for screening RdRp and its variants against very large chemical compounds libraries and has been made available to the scientific community through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene ID: 165451).","Madru, Clément; Tekpinar, Ayten Dizkirici; Rosario, Sandrine; Czernecki, Dariusz; Brûlé, Sébastien; Sauguet, Ludovic; Delarue, Marc",PLoS One,95,24

METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed, mild to severe Covid-19 in a French university hospital. Patients who received hydroxychloroquine (200mg tid dosage for 10 days) on a compassionate basis in addition to SOCwere compared to patients without contraindications to hydroxychloroquine who received SOCalone. A propensity score-weighted analysis was performed to control for confounders: age, sex, time between symptom onset and admission &#8804; 7 days, Charlson comorbidity index, medical history of arterial hypertension, and obesity, NEWS2 score at admission, and pneumonia severity. The primary endpoint was time to unfavorable outcome, defined as: death, admission to an intensive care unit, or decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments, whichever came first. RESULTS: Data from 89 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 were analyzed, 84 of whom were considered in the primary analysis; 38 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and 46 patients treated with SOCalone. At admission, the mean age of patients was 66 years, the median Charlson comorbidity index was 3, and the median NEWS2 severity score was 3. After propensity score weighting, treatment with hydroxycholoroquine was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of unfavorable outcome (HR 0.90 [0.38; 2.1], p = 0.81). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups (HR 0.89 [0.23; 3.47], p = 1). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with Covid-19, no significant reduction of the risk of unfavorable outcomes was observed with hydroxychloroquine in comparison to standard of care. Unmeasured confounders may however have persisted despite careful propensity-weighted analysis and the study might be underpowered. Ongoing controlled trials in patients with varying degrees of initial severity on a larger scale will help determine whether there is a place for hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19.","Paccoud, Olivier; Tubach, Florence; Baptiste, Amandine; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Hajage, David; Monsel, Gentiane; Tebano, Gianpiero; Boutolleau, David; Klement, Elise; Godefroy, Nagisa; Palich, Romain; Itani, Oula; Fayssal, Antoine; Valantin, Marc-Antoine; Tubiana, Roland; Burrel, Sonia; Calvez, Vincent; Caumes, Eric; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Pourcher, Valérie",Clin. infect. dis,95,16

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19-related public health measures on orthopaedic presentations to a regional Australian hospital. METHODS: A case-control study was performed at a regional trauma hospital in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data was collected prospectively from patients that required orthopaedic review in the period corresponding to a declaration of a global pandemic to the end of the NSW lockdown, and compared with retrospective data from the corresponding period in 2019. The five-year average of orthopaedic presentations to ED during the study period were obtained for comparison. The primary outcomes were overall number of presentations, mechanism and anatomical location of injuries, operative versus non-operative management and disposition. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, presentations requiring orthopaedic review were significantly more frequent than 2019 (496 vs. 280, p < 0.0001), with more requiring admission in 2020 (p < 0.0001). The absolute number of patients managed operatively was higher (p = 0.0002) and significantly more patients were referred for community follow-up (p < 0.0001). There was a 20% increase of consults in 2020 compared to the average number of referrals during the same period in the previous five years. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to other published literature, lockdown conditions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a surprising 77% increase in orthopaedic presentations to this regional Australian hospital.

Heparin is a cornerstone of treatment in critically ill COVID-19 patients. HIT antibodies can be detected by antigen tests and functional tests. Often strong reactivity in the antigen test is used as surrogate marker for the presence of clinically relevant, platelet activating antibodies. We observed an unexpectedly high percentage of COVID-19 patients, clinically suspected to have HIT, with high titer anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, but a negative functional test. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether in COVID-19 patients a serum-derived factor inhibits the heparin-induced platelet activation test (HIPA). METHODS AND RESULTS: 12 COVID-19 patients with suspected HIT were tested. Three samples tested negative in all assays; nine samples tested positive by antigen tests, among which only three tested also positive by HIPA. When we spiked COVID-19 serum or control serum with the human HIT antibody like mAb 5B9, reactivity of 5B9 remained the same. Also the purified IgG fractions of COVID-19 sera testing strongly positive in the PF4/heparin antigen test but negative in the functional test did not show increased reactivity in the functional test in comparison to the original serum. Both results make a functionally inhibitory factor in the serum/plasma of COVID-19 patients highly unlikely. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients often present with strong reactivity in PF4/heparin antigen tests without the presence of platelet-activating antibodies. Diagnosis of HIT requires confirmation of heparin-dependent, platelets activating antibodies to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment with non-heparin anticoagulants.","Brodard, Justine; Kremer Hovinga, Johanna A; Fontana, Pierre; Studt, Jan-Dirk; Gruel, Yves; Greinacher, Andreas",J. thromb. haemost,95,16

We developed recommendations for monitoring outside the ICU on the basis of available evidence and expert opinion. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies addressing the utility of cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in common pediatric conditions and drafted candidate monitoring recommendations based on our findings. We convened a panel of nominees from national professional organizations with diverse expertise: nursing, medicine, respiratory therapy, biomedical engineering, and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness and necessity in 3 sequential rating sessions and a moderated meeting. RESULTS: The panel evaluated 56 recommendations for intermittent and continuous monitoring for children hospitalized outside the ICU with 7 common conditions (eg, asthma, croup) and/or receiving common therapies (eg, supplemental oxygen, intravenous opioids). The panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of monitoring recommendations for 55 of 56 indications and on necessity of monitoring for 52. For mild or moderate asthma, croup, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, the panel recommended intermittent vital sign or oximetry measurement only. The panel recommended continuous monitoring for severe disease in each respiratory condition as well as for a new or increased dose of intravenous opiate or benzodiazepine. CONCLUSIONS: Expert panel members agreed that intermittent vital sign assessment, rather than continuous monitoring, is appropriate management for a set of specific conditions of mild or moderate severity that require hospitalization.","Schondelmeyer, Amanda C; Dewan, Maya L; Brady, Patrick W; Timmons, Kristen M; Cable, Rhonda; Britto, Maria T; Bonafide, Christopher P",Pediatrics,95,16

In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5 percent but a much higher 24.4 percent when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6 percent) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2 percent) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States.","Couch, Kenneth A; Fairlie, Robert W; Xu, Huanan",J Public Econ,95,1

Design: Single-center prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary-care University Hospital. Patients: All adult patients admitted in either the first (from March 15 to May 15, 2020) or second (from October 1 to November 30, 2020) wave of coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. During the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, 33 patients (4.8%) were transferred due to overcrowding and excluded from analysis. There were 341 (first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) and 695 (second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the hospital, with median age first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as 68 (57-80) and second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as 71 (60-80) (p = 0.15), and similar admission severity. For the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic versus second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, 30-day mortality was 74/341 (22%) and 98/662 (15%) (p = 0.007). In the ward, 11/341 (3.2%) and 404/662 (61%) received dexamethasone (p &lt; 0.001);6/341 (2%) and 79/662 (12%) received high-flow nasal oxygen (p &lt; 0.0001);2/341 (0.6%) and 88/662 (13.3%) received remdesivir (p &lt; 0.0001);249/341 (73%) and 0/662 (0%) received hydroxychloroquine (p &lt; 0.0001);and 87/341 (26%) and 128/662 (19%) (p = 0.024) patients were transferred to ICU. On ICU admission, median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was 6 (3-7) and 4 (3-6) (p = 0.02). High-flow nasal oxygen was given to 16/87 (18%) and 102/128 (80%) (p &lt; 0.001);69/87 (79%) and 56/128 (44%) received mechanical ventilation (p &lt; 0.001) with durations 17 days (10-26 d) and 10 days (5-17 d) (p = 0.01). Median ICU length of stay was 14 days (5-27 d) and 6 days (3-11 d) (p &lt; 0.001). Finally, 16/87 (18%) and 8/128 (6%) received renal replacement therapy (p = 0.0055);and 64/87 (74%) and 51/128 (40%) needed vasopressor support (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The main therapeutic changes between the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were use of steroids, unrestrictive use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic patients, and transfer of patients to other geographic areas in the case of ICU overcrowding. These changes were associated with a decrease in 30-day mortality, ICU admission, and organ support.","Lambermont, B.; Rousseau, A. F.; Seidel, L.; Thys, M.; Cavalleri, J.; Delanaye, P.; Chase, J.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in 'flattening' or 'squashing the curve' in Germany. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19. Results: A shutdown that is successful in 'flattening the curve' is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.01 and 0.05 life years (0.1 to 0.6 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between 616 and 4797 per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 1% to 12% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in 'squashing the curve' is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.8 life years (0.9 months) per capita, corresponding to 19% of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population. Nevertheless, questions around the affordability and underfunding of other parts of the healthcare system emerge.","Gandjour, Afschin",,95,16

However, there are tensions between GHS and UHC strategy and implementation. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between GHS and UHC using two recent quantitative indices. METHODS: We conducted a macro-analysis to determine the presence of relationship between GHS index (GHSI) and UHC index (UHCI). We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 with a 95% level of confidence. FINDINGS: There is a moderate and significant relationship between GHSI and UHCI (r = 0.662, p<0.001) and individual indices of UHCI (maternal and child health and infectious diseases: r = 0.623 (p<0.001) and 0.594 (p<0.001), respectively). However, there is no relationship between GHSI and the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) index (r = 0.063, p>0.05). The risk of GHS threats a significant and negative correlation with the capacity for GHS (r = -0.604, p<0.001) and the capacity for UHC (r = -0.792, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The aspiration for GHS will not be realized without UHC; hence, the tension between these two global health agendas should be transformed into a synergistic solution. We argue that strengthening the health systems, in tandem with the principles of primary health care, and implementing a ""One Health"" approach will progressively enable countries to achieve both UHC and GHS towards a healthier and safer world that everyone aspires to live in.","Assefa, Yibeltal; Hill, Peter S; Gilks, Charles F; Damme, Wim Van; Pas, Remco van de; Woldeyohannes, Solomon; Reid, Simon",PLoS One,95,25

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the knowledge level, causes, prevalence, and determinants of self-medication practices for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between June and July 2020 among the Nigerian population, using a self-reported questionnaire. Statistical analysis of descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses was done using STATA 15. Results: A total of 461 respondents participated in the survey. Almost all the respondents had sufficient knowledge about self-medication (96.7%). The overall prevalence of self-medication for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was 41%. The contributing factors were fear of stigmatization or discrimination (79.5%), fear of being quarantine (77.3%), and fear of infection or contact with a suspected person (76.3%). The proximal reasons for self-medication were emergency illness (49.1%), delays in receiving hospital services (28.1%), distance to the health facility (23%), and proximity of the pharmacy (21%). The most commonly used drugs for self-medication were vitamin C and multivitamin (51.8%) and antimalarials (24.9%). These drugs were bought mainly from pharmacies (73.9%). From the multivariable logistic regression model, males (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.07-0.54), and sufficient knowledge on SM (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.19-0.77) were significantly associated with self-medication. Conclusion: The key finding of this study was the use of different over-the-counter medications for the prevention (mainly vitamin C and multivitamins) and treatment (antibiotics/antimicrobial) of perceived COVID-19 infection by Nigerians with mainly tertiary education. This is despite their high knowledge and risk associated with self-medication. We suggest that medication outlets, media and community should be engaged to support the rational use of medication.","Wegbom, Anthony Ike; Edet, Clement Kevin; Raimi, Olatunde; Fagbamigbe, Adeniyi Francis; Kiri, Victor Alangibi",Front Public Health,95,15

The origin of the virus appears to be zoonotic; it has been proposed that it comes from a bat and that it may have had an intermediate host that led to its introduction in the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, with a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and it binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme, present in susceptible cells, to infect the human respiratory system. Although other coronaviruses have been previously known, they have not had the same impact, and, therefore, research on pharmacological treatments is not sufficiently developed to face the current challenge. Almost since the beginning of the epidemic, several molecules have been proposed for the treatment of infection; however, there is not yet a drug available with sufficient effectiveness for treatment.

METHOD: We mapped the distribution of Aotearoa New Zealand's population and the location of potential vaccine delivery facilities under each scenario. Geostatistical techniques identified population clusters for Maori, Pacific peoples and people aged 65 years and over. We calculated travel times between all potential facilities and each Statistical Area 1 in the country. Descriptive statistics indicate the size and proportion of populations that could face significant travel barriers when accessing COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: Several areas with significant travel times to potential vaccine delivery sites were also communities identified as having an elevated risk of COVID-19 disease and severity. All potential scenarios for vaccine delivery, with the exception of schools, resulted in travel barriers for a substantial proportion of the population. Overall, these travel time barriers disproportionately burden Maori, older communities and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSION: The equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines is key to an elimination strategy. However, if current health services and facilities are used without well-designed and supported outreach services, then access to vaccination is likely to be inequitable.","Whitehead, J.; Scott, N.; Carr, P.

What started as an interesting report of pneumonia of unknown etiology in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, bloomed into an international crisis by mid-January 2020. However, it was not until late January, when the first case was reported in the United States, that a new reality took shape for US public health agencies. After all, severe acute respiratory syndrome never made it to this country, and the only 2 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome here were imported and never spread. Local public health agencies are notoriously short-staffed and underfunded. Therefore, when a crisis looms, personnel from a multitude of areas within the agencies are called upon to help out. Under its innovative and forward-thinking leadership, the St. Louis County Department of Health internally implemented the Incident Command System, a component of the National Incident Management System. While reassignment of individuals to new responsibilities under a new and temporary reporting structure did not always go perfectly, ICS kept its promise to be adaptable to a fast-evolving situation, to clearly outline needed areas of responsibility, and to provide scaffolding that kept the Department of Health functional in chaotic times. It was able to be implemented quickly within hours of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in St. Louis County and enhanced the quality and timeliness of the public health response.

The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected cases. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases. RESULTS: We included 5 retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Critical cases with complications were 9%, intensive care unit admission was required in 7.3%, invasive ventilation in 3.4%, and mortality was 2.4%. CONCLUSION: Otolaryngologists should know that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, olfactory, and gustative disorders could be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical presentation together with radiological and laboratory findings could help to identify suspected cases.","Lovato, Andrea; de Filippis, Cosimo",Ear Nose Throat J,95,33

DESIGN: Real-world prospective observational study. SETTING: VH remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (postaccident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or postinpatient admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care during VH follow-up and for 2 weeks post-VH discharge. RESULTS: 900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 postinpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced clinical deterioration (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of clinical deterioration were increase in age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 (95% CI 1.41 to 5.82)), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.04)), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30=9.09 (95% CI 2.01 to 41.09)) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.60)). CONCLUSIONS: These predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services.

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay (~1500 bps) to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20 J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays (~300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay. The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 31 clinical samples (7 fully-sequenced swab samples, and 24 uncharacterized ones) and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported. The long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs (93%), allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples. The Spanish variant was detected in 14/24 of the uncharacterized samples as well. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20 J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.","La Rosa, G; Mancini, P; Bonanno Ferraro, G; Veneri, C; Iaconelli, M; Lucentini, L; Bonadonna, L; Brusaferro, S; Brandtner, D; Fasanella, A; Pace, L; Parisi, A; Galante, D; Suffredini, E",Water Res,95,24

To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder architecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets.

COVID-19 is primarily associated with lung injury, but many other clinical symptoms such as loss of smell and taste demonstrated broad tissue tropism of the virus. Early SARS-CoV-2-host cell interactions and entry mechanisms remain poorly understood. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissue culture, we found that the protease TMPRSS2 determines the entry pathway used by the virus. In the presence of TMPRSS2, the proteolytic process of SARS-CoV-2 was completed at the plasma membrane, and the virus rapidly entered the cells within 10 min in a pH-independent manner. When target cells lacked TMPRSS2 expression, the virus was endocytosed and sorted into endolysosomes, from which SARS-CoV-2 entered the cytosol via acid-activated cathepsin L protease 40-60 min post-infection. Overexpression of TMPRSS2 in non-TMPRSS2 expressing cells abolished the dependence of infection on the cathepsin L pathway and restored sensitivity to the TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through distinct, mutually exclusive entry routes and highlight the importance of TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 sorting into either pathway.","Koch, Jana; Uckeley, Zina M; Doldan, Patricio; Stanifer, Megan; Boulant, Steeve; Lozach, Pierre-Yves",EMBO J,95,16

Our aim was to monitor the effect of the coronavirus lockdown in diabetes management in children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) wearing insulin pump equipped with continuous glucose monitoring system. METHODS: In 34 children with T1DM on Medtronic 640G insulin pump equipped with the Enlite Sensor uploaded CareLink data were categorized in 2 three-week periods before and after the 10th of March. RESULTS: Mean time in range (TIR) did not significantly differ between the two periods. However, a significantly higher Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicating an increased glucose variability in the pre-lockdown period was observed (39.52% versus 37.40%, p = 0.011). Blood glucose readings were significantly fewer during the lockdown period (7.91 versus 7.41, p = 0.001). No significant difference was recorded regarding the total daily dose of insulin and the reported carbohydrates consumed. However, the meal schedule has changed dramatically as the percentage of breakfast consumed before 10.00 a.m. has fallen from 80.67% to 41.46% (p < 0.001) during the lockdown. Correspondingly, the percentage of dinner consumption before 10.00 p.m. significantly fell during the lockdown period (60.22% versus 53.78%, p = 0.019).

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Liu, Chang; Yount, Boyd; Gully, Kendra; Yang, Yang; Auerbach, Ashley; Peng, Guiqing; Baric, Ralph; Li, Fang",PLoS Pathog,95,20

The policy was revised in three subsequent stages (Lockdown 2.0-4.0 between 15 April to 18 May 2020), and restrictions were lifted (Unlockdown 1.0) on 1 June 2020. This study evaluated the effect of lockdown policy on the COVID-19 incidence rate at the national level to inform policy response for this and future pandemics. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with a segmented regression model using publicly available data on daily reported new COVID-19 cases between 2 March 2020 and 1 September 2020. National-level data from Google Community Mobility Reports during this timeframe were also used in model development and robustness checks. Results showed an 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 6-9%] reduction in the change in incidence rate per day after Lockdown 1.0 compared to prior to the Lockdown order, with an additional reduction of 3% (95% CI = 2-3%) after Lockdown 4.0, suggesting an 11% (95% CI = 9-12%) reduction in the change in COVID-19 incidence after Lockdown 4.0 compared to the period before Lockdown 1.0. Uptake of the lockdown policy is indicated by decreased mobility and attenuation of the increasing incidence of COVID-19. The increasing rate of incident case reports in India was attenuated after the lockdown policy was implemented compared to before, and this reduction was maintained after the restrictions were eased, suggesting that the policy helped to 'flatten the curve' and buy additional time for pandemic preparedness, response and recovery.","Thayer, Winter M; Hasan, Md Zabir; Sankhla, Prithvi; Gupta, Shivam",Health policy plan,95,1

In this study, we investigated the clinical benefits and initiation of favipiravir treatment in patients with non-severe coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to calculate the area under the curve, and the optimal cut-off values for the time to initiate favipiravir treatment were calculated to predict defervescence within seven days. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential influencing factors of defervescence. This was defined as a body temperature of less than 37 °C for at least 2 days. RESULTS: Data from 41 patients were used for the efficacy assessment. The days from the onset of fever to defervescence showed a positive correlation with the duration from the onset of fever to initiation of favipiravir treatment (r = 0.548, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off value was the administration of favipiravir on day 4. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the optimal cut-off value from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment: early treatment group (within 4-days) and late treatment group (more than 4-days). In the multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, and days from onset to initiation of favipiravir treatment, the significant factors were male sex and days of initiation of the favipiravir treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that if favipiravir is to be used for treatment, it should be initiated as early as possible.","Fujii, Satoshi; Ibe, Yuta; Ishigo, Tomoyuki; Inamura, Hirotoshi; Kunimoto, Yusuke; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Kuronuma, Koji; Nakata, Hiromasa; Fukudo, Masahide; Takahashi, Satoshi",J. infect. chemother,95,24

IPV victimization may, in turn, contribute to physical and mental health, substance use, and social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of the current study was to understand the extent to which 1) COVID-19 stressors are associated with IPV victimization and 2) IPV victimization is associated with health and health behaviors. Participants (N = 1,813) completed an online survey between May 15 and 28, 2020 that assessed COVID-19 stressors (financial anxiety, social disconnection, health anxiety, COVID-19-specific stress), IPV victimization, physical and mental health, substance use, and movement outside of the home. Structural equation modeling indicated that greater COVID-19-related stressors were associated with greater IPV victimization during the pandemic, even after controlling for enduring vulnerabilities associated with IPV victimization. Additionally, greater IPV victimization during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with higher levels of substance use and movement outside of the home, but not poorer physical and mental health. COVID-19 stressors may have detrimental relationship effects and health implications, underscoring the need for increased IPV intervention and support services during the pandemic. Findings from the current work provide preliminary correlational evidence for a theoretical model centered on IPV victimization, rather than perpetration.","Gresham, Abriana M.; Peters, Brett J.; Karantzas, Gery Cameron Linda D.; Simpson, Jeffry A.",Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,95,11

However, little is known about the exact mechanism of this signaling. A recent study from Dr. David C. Rubinsztein's lab showed that ULK1 is activated by AMPK upon glucose starvation, resulting in the phosphorylation of the lipid kinase PIKFYVE on S1548. The activated PIKFYVE consequently enhances the formation of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtdIns5P)-containing autophagosomes, and therefore drives autophagy upregulation. The novel discovery of how ULK1 regulates the non-canonical autophagy signaling (PtdIns5P-dependent autophagy), not only expands our knowledge of autophagy, but also sheds light on therapeutic strategies for curing human disorders, where glucose-induced starvation can play an important role.","Yang, Ying; Klionsky, Daniel J",Autophagy,95,21

Our electoral institutions survived that test, but the fragility of our democracy was exposed by a concerted effort to overturn the results of the presidential election, first in the courts and then with an insurrection at the nation's Capitol on January 6, 2021. We examine how this happened. Specifically, we will attempt to answer the following questions: How did the big lie evolve and what were its claims? How did the COVID pandemic and foreign interference complicate the voting process and contribute to the claims of fraud? How did the courts adjudicate the claims of fraud? Finally, how do we restore trust in the voting process?","Canon, David T.; Sherman, Owen",Presidential Studies Quarterly,95,16

To evaluate COVID-19 health disparities in the community and inform public health, health system, and community-based interventions, local public health authorities analyzed the sociodemographic characteristics of persons who were diagnosed, hospitalized, and who died with COVID-19 in Denver, Colorado. During the first 7 months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denver (March 6-October 6, 2020) the majority of adult COVID-19 cases (54.8%), hospitalizations (62.1%), and deaths (51.2%) were among persons identifying as Hispanic, more than double the proportion of Hispanic adults in the Denver community (24.9%) (1). Systemic drivers that influence how Hispanic persons live and work increase their exposure risks: compared with non-Hispanic persons, Hispanic persons with COVID-19 in Denver reported larger household sizes and were more likely to report known exposures to household and close contacts with COVID-19, working in an essential industry, and working while ill. Reducing the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among Hispanic persons will require implementation of strategies that address upstream social and environmental factors that contribute to an increased risk for both infection and transmission and that facilitate improved access to culturally congruent care.","Podewils, Laura Jean; Burket, Tori L; Mettenbrink, Christie; Steiner, Abigail; Seidel, Allison; Scott, Kenneth; Cervantes, Lilia; Hasnain-Wynia, Romana",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,95,7

METHODS: We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from PubMed and other COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative and accurate subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant. We used this subset to construct a knowledge graph, and applied five state-of-the-art, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, and STELP) to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. RESULTS: Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.854) in identifying accurate semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1 = 0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as others that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled identification of additional candidate drugs and generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the links between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (i.e., paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, metoclopramide, and oxymatrine) and the mechanistic explanations for their potential use are further discussed. CONCLUSION: We showed that a LBD approach can be feasible not only for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, but also for generating mechanistic explanations. Our approach can be generalized to other diseases as well as to other clinical questions.

Elevated D-dimer levels which correlated inversely with overall survival were recently reported in Chinese cohort studies. Critically however, ethnicity has major effects on thrombotic risk, with a 3-4-fold lower risk in Chinese compared to Caucasians and a significantly higher risk in African-Americans. In this study, we investigated COVID19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients. Our findings confirm that severe COVID19 infection is associated with a significant coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity. Importantly however, Caucasian COVID19 patients on low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis rarely develop overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In rare COVID19 cases where DIC does develop, it tends to be restricted to late-stage disease. Collectively, these data suggest that the diffuse bilateral pulmonary inflammation observed in COVID19 is associated with a novel pulmonary-specific vasculopathy termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) as distinct to DIC. Given that thrombotic risk is significantly impacted by race, coupled with the accumulating evidence that coagulopathy is important in COVID19 pathogenesis, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulmonary vasculopathy may contribute to the unexplained differences that are beginning to emerge highlighting racial susceptibility to COVID19 mortality.","Fogarty, Helen; Townsend, Liam; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Browne, Paul; Bacon, Christopher L; Gaule, Richard; Gillett, Alexander; Byrne, Mary; Ryan, Kevin; O039,; Connell, Niamh; Sullivan, Jamie M; Conlon, Niall; Donnell, James S",Br J Haematol,95,16

Since there is neither a vaccine nor a drug for Covid-19, people with an increased risk for severe and fatal courses of disease particularly need protection. Furthermore, factors increasing these risks are of interest in the search of potential treatments. A systematic literature review on the risk factors of severe and fatal Covid-19 courses is presented. METHODS: The review is carried out on PubMed and a publicly available preprint dataset. For analysis, risk factors are categorized and information regarding the study such as study size and location are extracted. The results are compared to risk factors listed by four public authorities from different countries. RESULTS: The 28 records included, eleven of which are preprints, indicate that conditions and comorbidities connected to a poor state of health such as high age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease courses. Furthermore, severe and fatal courses are associated with organ damages mainly affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Coagulation dysfunctions could play a critical role in the organ damaging. Time to hospital admission, tuberculosis, inflammation disorders and coagulation dysfunctions are identified as risk factors found in the review but not mentioned by the public authorities. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with increased risk of severe or fatal disease courses were identified, which include conditions connected with a poor state of health as well as organ damages and coagulation dysfunctions. The results may facilitate upcoming Covid-19 research.","Wolff, Dominik; Nee, Sarah; Hickey, Natalie Sandy; Marschollek, Michael",Infection,95,26

We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the squid Euprymna scolopes. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (&#916;ssrA) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host's response to colonization by the &#916;ssrA strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the &#916;ssrA strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont's sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on the number of patients visiting theEmergency Surgical Department (ESD) of a tertiary Greek hospital. It is common sense that the vast majority of patientsexamined in the ESDs have no symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2. Methods In this retrospective study, data exported from the Sismanogleio General Hospital's Emergency Department (ED)were studied during 4 different periods;a) the full lockdown period of 53 days, from 03/13/2020 to 05/04/2020, b) theperiod of 53 days right before the lockdown, from 01/20/2020 to 03/12/2020, c) the period of 53 days right after thelockdown, from 05/05/2020 to 06/26/2020 and d) the time period of the previous year that is analogous with the lockdownduration, from 03/13/2019 to 05/04/2019. Results The number of patients visiting the ESD of our hospital was significantly altered during the lockdown period([ Tab.1 ]). The reduction of this number is remarkable compared to the rest time periods of the study. To be exact, this decreaseis 55.32 %, 52.58 %, and 55.79 % compared to the pre-traffic ban duration, the post-ban span, and the previous year'ssimilar time period. Conclusions Data provided by our ED is congruent with many other reports all over the world showing a dramaticlessening of people attending the ESD amid the outbreak of COVID-19.

We surveyed Pennsylvania school nurses (N = 350) in May 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on nurses' concerns about returning to school and impact on practice. Data were analyzed using &#967;2 tests and regression analyses. Urban school nurses were more concerned about returning to the school building without a COVID-19 vaccine than rural nurses (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.05, 2.38]). Nurses in urban locales were more likely to report being asked for guidance on COVID-19 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI [1.06, 2.68]), modify communication practices (OR = 2.33, 95% CI [1.42, 3.82]), and be ""very/extremely concerned"" about their safety (OR = 2.16, 95% CI [1.35, 3.44]).

Hence, it is of high importance for public health officials to know whether people are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to examine the willingness of adult residents in Greece to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional was survey conducted among the adult general population of Greece between April 28, 2020 to May 03, 2020 (last week of lockdown), using a mixed methodology for data collection: Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer Assisted web Interviewing (CAWI). Using a sample size calculator, the target sample size was found to be around 1000 respondents. To ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population according to the Greek census 2011, a proportionate stratified by region systematic sampling procedure was used to recruit particpants. Data collection was guided through a structured questionnaire. Regarding willingness to COVID-19 vaccination, participants were asked to answer the following question: ""If there was a vaccine available for the novel coronavirus, would you do it?"" RESULTS: Of 1004 respondents only 57.7% stated that they are going to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Respondents aged > 65 years old, those who either themselves or a member of their household belonged to a vulnerable group, those believing that the COVID-19 virus was not developed in laboratories by humans, those believing that coronavirus is far more contagious and lethal compared to the H1N1 virus, and those believing that next waves are coming were statistically significantly more likely to be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Higher knowledge score regarding symptoms, transmission routes and prevention and control measures against COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher willingness of respondents to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of individuals in the general population are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, stressing the need for public health officials to take immediate awareness-raising measures.","Kourlaba, Georgia; Kourkouni, Eleni; Maistreli, Stefania; Tsopela, Christina-Grammatiki; Molocha, Nafsika-Maria; Triantafyllou, Christos; Koniordou, Markela; Kopsidas, Ioannis; Chorianopoulou, Evangelia; Maroudi-Manta, Stefania; Filippou, Dimitrios; Zaoutis, Theoklis E",Glob Health Res Policy,95,21

Main cause of death is cardiorespiratory arrest with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Respiratory depression is mediated by opioid µ receptors expressed on respiratory neurons in the CNS. Studies on the major sites in the brainstem mediating respiratory rate suppression, the pre-BÓ§tzinger complex and parabrachial complex (including the KÓ§lliker Fuse nucleus), have yielded conflicting findings and interpretations but recent investigations involving deletion of µ receptors from neurons have led to greater consensus. Some opioid analgesic drugs are histamine releasers. The range of clinical effects of released histamine include increased cardiac output due to an increase in heart rate, increased force of myocardial contraction, and a dilatatory effect on small blood vessels leading to flushing, decreased vascular resistance and hypotension. Resultant hemodynamic changes do not necessarily relate directly to the concentration of histamine in plasma due to a range of variables including functional differences between mast cells and histamine-induced anaphylactoid reactions may occur less often than commonly believed. Opioid-induced histamine release rarely if ever provokes bronchospasm and histamine released by opioids in normal doses does not lead to anaphylactoid reactions or result in IgE-mediated reactions in normal patients. Hypersensitivities to opioids, mainly some skin reactions and occasional type I hypersensitivities, chiefly anaphylaxis and urticaria, are uncommon. Hypersensitivities to morphine, codeine, heroin, methadone, meperidine, fentanyl, remifentanil, buprenorphine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan are summarized. In 2016, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication concerning the association of opioids with serotonin syndrome, a toxicity associated with raised intra-synaptic concentrations of serotonin in the CNS, inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and activation of 5-HT receptors. Opioids may provoke serotonin toxicity especially if administered in conjunction with other serotonergic medications. The increasing use of opioid analgesics and widespread prescribing of antidepressants and psychiatric medicines, indicates the likelihood of an increased incidence of serotonin toxicity in opioid-treated patients.","Baldo, Brian A",Arch. toxicol,95,1

This meta-analysis aimed to address the current interest of whether the administration of PPI could increase the susceptibility and risk of poor outcome in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, EBSCOhost, and EuropePMC databases up until 3 December 2020. The main outcome was composite poor outcome which comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 in this study was defined as patients with COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe CAP, including the need for intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was susceptibility, based on cohort comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. RESULTS: There were a total of 290,455 patients from 12 studies in this meta-analysis. PPI use was associated with increased composite poor outcome (OR 1.85 [1.13, 3.03], p = 0.014; I2 90.26%). Meta-regression analysis indicate that the association does not vary by age (OR 0.97 [0.92, 1.02], p = 0.244), male (OR 1.05 [0.99, 1.11], p = 0.091), hypertension (OR 9.98 [0.95, 1.02], p = 0.317), diabetes (OR 0.99 [0.93, 1.05], p = 0.699), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.01 [0.93, 1.10], p = 0.756), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (OR 1.02 [0.96, 1.09], p = 0.499), and pre-admission/in-hospital PPI use (OR 0.77 [0.26, 2.31], p = 0.644). PPI use was not associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19 (OR 1.56 [0.48, 5.05], p = 0.46; I2 99.7%).

Further, the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on residency selection that is undetermined. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine to what degree and the type of PRS SM content that drives prospective applicants' interest of a residency program, especially in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective PRS residency applicants were surveyed anonymously. RESULTS: An average of 60% of respondents reported that PRS social media (SM) content influenced their perception of a program. Fifty-eight percent reported that resident lifestyle content made them gain interest in a program. Separately, 32% reported that resident lifestyle content influenced them to rank a program higher. Seventy-two percent of respondents claimed SM content did not make them lose interest in a program. Rarely posting, outdated content, and lack of engagement were cited as factors for loss of interest in a program. A majority of respondents (53%) reported wanting to see more resident life and culture content on SM. Of the existing PRS SM content, respondents were most interested in resident lifestyle, followed by clinical and program-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the importance of SM PRS residency selection. Resident lifestyle content was consistently indicated as more likely to make respondents gain interest in a program, rank a program higher, and as the most desired content. PRS programs will benefit from highlighting resident camaraderie, quality of life, hobbies, and lifestyle to attract applicants.","Duque, Sofia; Riccelli, Vincent; Mulqueen, Sydney; Zhang, Andrew Y",Aesthet. surg. j,95,4

In the UK, as of August 2021, they have not been approved, except in a few limited circumstances. To date, little qualitative research exists to explain the reasons and nuances behind public attitudes on this issue. MethodsQualitative group and one-to-one online interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of 24 adults to explore their views on the issue of COVID-19 vaccination in children. ResultsCOVID-19 vaccination in children was framed as a complex problem (a ""minefield""). Six themes emerged to explain participants views: (1) Uncertainty over whether children can catch, transmit or be severely harmed by COVID-19; (2) Lower risk tolerance for unknown longer-term effects of the vaccine in children; (3) Association of the vaccine program with governments handling of the pandemic; (4) Local social norms as a driver of hesitancy; (5) Vaccinating children as a way to protect vulnerable adults; (6) Childrens vaccination as parental choice. ConclusionsPublic attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination in children are likely to be met with more hesitancy compared to adult vaccinations. Public health communications will need to combat this hesitancy if vaccine uptake for children is to be pursued as a public health policy.","Williams, Simon N",,95,30

Procedures generating airway aerosols are dangerous for every participant of patient care. The serious form of coronavirus infection can cause progressive respiratory failure. The best treatment is early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Intubation is an aerosol-generating process and thus carries the risk of contamination.

This is especially pertinent to the needs of pregnant women; a group traditionally poorly represented in drug trials, yet a group at heightened risk of unintended adverse materno-fetal consequences due to the unique physiology of pregnancy and the life course implications of fetal or neonatal drug exposure. However, due to the complexities of drug trial participation when pregnant (be they vaccines or therapeutics for acute disease), many clinical drug trials will exclude them. Clinicians must determine the best course of drug treatment with a dearth of evidence from either clinical or preclinical studies, where at least in the short term they may be more focused on the outcome of the mother than of her offspring.","Wiese, Michael D; Berry, Mary J; Hissaria, Pravin; Darby, Jack R T; Morrison, Janna L",J Dev Orig Health Dis,95,2

This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. METHODS: A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS: The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION: The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill. The multipronged dissemination approach enhanced the reach of WCAHS COVID-19 resources.","Riden, Heather E; Schilli, Kara; Pinkerton, Kent E",J Agromedicine,95,33

Methionine- and choline-deficient diets (MCDD) induce fatty liver in mice which is partly mediated by triglyceride (TG) lipolysis in white adipose tissues (WATs). Because Fatp4 knockdown has been shown to increase adipocyte lipolysis in vitro, here, we determined the effects of MCDD on WAT lipolysis in aP2-Cre Fatp4-knockout (Fatp4A-/- ) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated WATs of Fatp4A-/- mice exposed to MCD medium showed an increase in lipolysis, and the strongest effect was noted on glycerol release from subcutaneous fat. Fatp4A-/- mice fed with MCDD for 4 weeks showed an increase in serum glycerol, TG, and leptin levels associated with the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase in subcutaneous fat. Chow-fed Fatp4A-/- mice also showed an increase in serum leptin and very-low-density lipoproteins as well as liver phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels. Both chow- and MCDD-fed Fatp4A-/- mice showed a decrease in serum ketone and WAT sphingomyelin levels which supported a metabolic shift to TG for subsequent WAT lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Adipose Fatp4 deficiency led to TG lipolysis and leptin release, which were exaggerated by MCDD. Our data imply hyperlipidemia risk by a low dietary choline intake and gene mutations that increase adipose TG levels. This article is protected by copyright.

In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","Alhajri, Noora; Simsekler, Mecit Can Emre; Alfalasi, Buthaina; Alhashmi, Mohamed; AlGhatrif, Majd; Balalaa, Nahed; Al Ali, Maryam; Almaashari, Raghda; Al Memari, Shammah; Al Hosani, Farida; Al Zaabi, Yousif; Almazroui, Shereena; Alhashemi, Hamed; Baltatu, Ovidiu C",JMIR Med Inform,95,16

In response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a new initiative to support health care staff to share healthy meals with their families was developed. At a hospital in Queensland, Australia, dietetic staff collaborated with the on-site food service retailer to develop and offer a range of hot meals that staff could take home for their families at the end of their day. The meals were nutritious, reasonably priced, and designed to feed a family of four. The dietetic staff worked with the hospital marketing department and staff health and wellness program to promote the initiative. Over the 3 months that it has been running, nearly 300 meals have been purchased. Anecdotal comments from the food service retailer highlighted that the initiative was a good thing to do for staff to maintain a positive reputation of the business.

METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance semi-structured interviews and group discussions engaged a purposefully selected sample of oral health care workers and patients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were asked to appraise a preparedness model by considering how to prepare for oral care during a pandemic, while answering open-ended questions about the model content and visual presentation. Interviews and group discussions occurred between April 2020 and January 2021, were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive coding process was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants, including 19 dentists, 15 dental hygienists, 10 certified dental assistants, 9 administrators, and 21 patients, suggested modifications to the recently developed preparedness model. Individual interviews (41 participants) and group discussions (33 participants in groups ranging from 2 to 9 attendees each) lasted for an average of 53 min. Eighty-four hours of audio recordings led to more than 1110 single-spaced pages of transcripts. The thematic analysis identified 82 codes, 12 categories, and four main themes: life-long learning, critical thinking, personal and professional risk, and patient-centred care. These themes were understood within provider characteristics and social and environmental contexts. Participants highlighted the need for the model to focus on information and communication, developing awareness and understanding, inferring risks, and performing oral health care during a threat such as a pandemic or disease outbreak. A modified portrayal of the model was suggested to better represent participants' perspectives. CONCLUSION: A recently developed preparedness model for the provision of dental care during an unfolding threat like the COVID-19 pandemic was appraised and modified by oral health care workers. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the modified model for use in the event of another unfolding threat collaboratively with providers, patients and stakeholders.","Brondani, Mario; Donnelly, Leeann",BMC Oral Health,95,16

Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of 2 potentially useful control strategies based on testing: (1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and (2) serological testing followed by an ""immune shield"" approach, that is, low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The ""immune shield"" strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical, and financial implications. The main nonpharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (eg, capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (eg, universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable.","Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Cheung, Chi-Ngai; Handel, Andreas",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,95,25

The concept was adopted in other hospitals and published as a case series. This is the first prospectively controlled randomized study comparing DCS and conventional treatment (Group C) in this setting. METHODS: All consecutive patients from 2013 to 2018 with indication for surgery were screened and randomized to Group DCS or Group C. The primary outcome was the rate of reconstructed bowel at discharge and at 6 month. Informed consent was obtained. The trial was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at CinicalTrials.gov: NCT04034407. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were screened; 41 patients gave informed consent to participate and ultimately 21 patients (9 female) with intraoperatively confirmed Hinchey III (n = 14, 67%) or IV (n = 7, 33%), and a median (range) age of 66 (42-92), Mannheim Peritonitis Index of 25 (12-37) and Charlson Comorbidity Index of 3 (0-10) were intraoperatively randomized and treated as Group DCS (n = 13) or Group C (n = 8). Per protocol analysis: A primary anastomosis without ileostomy (PA) was performed in 92% (11/12) patients in Group DCS at the second-look operation, one patient died before second look, and one underwent a Hartmann procedure (HP). In Group C 63% (5/8) patients received a PA and 38% (3/8) patients a HP. Two patients in Group C, but none in Group DCS experienced anastomotic leakage (AI). ICU and hospital stay was median (range) 2 (1-10) and 17.5 (12-43) in DCS and 2 (1-62) and 22 (13-65) days in group C. In Group DCS 8% (1/12) patients was discharged with a stoma versus 57% (4/7) in Group C (p = 0.038, n.s., &#945; = 0.025); one patient died before discharge. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for discharge with a stoma is 0.068 (0.005-0.861). Intent to treat analysis: A PA was performed in 90% (9/10) of patients randomized to DCS, one patient died before the second look, and one patient received a HP. In group C, 70% (7/10) were treated with PA and 30% (3/10) with HP. 29% (2/7) experienced AI treated with protective ileostomy. In group DCS, 9% (1/11) were discharged with a stoma versus 40% (4/10) in group C (p = 0.14, n.s.). The odds ratio for discharge with a stoma is 0.139 (0.012-1.608). CONCLUSION: This is the first prospectively randomized controlled study showing that damage control surgery in perforated diverticulitis Hinchey III and IV enhances reconstruction of bowel continuity and can reduce the stoma rate at discharge.","Kafka-Ritsch, Reinhold; Zitt, Matthias; Perathoner, Alexander; Gasser, Elisabeth; Kaufman, Claudia; Czipin, Sasha; Aigner, Felix; Öfner, Dietmar",World j. sur,95,16

In this study, we sought to determine the role of specific microRNA (miRs) associated with VEGF in patients with PDR pathology. METHODS: RNA sequencing was employed to detect differentially circulating microRNA (miR) associated with VEGF in DM (Diabetes mellitus), NPDR (non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) and PDR patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the concentration of miR-15b in the serum of DM patients (n=115), NPDR (n=47) or PDR (n=76). The effects of miR-15b on DR and regulation of VEGF and endothelial cell function were also characterized. RESULTS: We demonstrated that circulating miR-15b was directly associated with VEGF compared to other miRs in PDR patients. We found a significant inverse relationship between low levels of miR-15b and high levels of VEGF in patients with PDR when compared to the DM or NPDR groups. We found that miR-15b regulates the expression of VEGF by targeting the 3'-UTR regions to inhibit its transcription. Similarly, overexpression of miR-15b suppressed vascular abnormalities in vivo in diabetic GK rats, inhibiting endothelial tube formation, and VEGF expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, circulating miR-15b is associated with PDR and may be targeted to regulate VEGF expression and angiogenesis.","Yang, Ying; Liu, Yan; Li, Yiping; Chen, Zhongli; Xiong, Yixin; Zhou, Taicheng; Tao, Wenyu; Xu, Fan; Yang, Hanling; Ylä-Herttuala, Seppo; Chaurasia, Shyam S; Whaley-Connell, Adam; Yang, Ke",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,95,24

A moratorium on elective surgery was placed early in the pandemic to reduce risk to patients and staff and preserve critical care resources. This report evaluates the impact of the elective surgical moratorium on case volumes and intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. METHODS: This retrospective review used a national convenience sample to correlate trends in the weekly rates of surgical cases at 170 Veterans Affairs Hospitals around the United States from January 1 to September 30, 2020 to national trends in the COVID-19 pandemic. We reviewed data on weekly number of procedures performed and ICU bed usage, stratified by level of urgency (elective, urgent, emergency), and whether an ICU bed was required within 24 hours of surgery. National data on the proportion of COVID-19 positive test results and mortality rates were obtained from the Center for Disease Control website. RESULTS: 198,911 unique surgical procedures performed during the study period. The total number of cases performed from January 1 to March 16 was 86,004 compared with 15,699 from March 17 to May 17. The reduction in volume occurred before an increase in the percentage of COVID-19 positive test results and deaths nationally. There was a 91% reduction from baseline in the number of elective surgeries performed allowing 78% of surgical ICU beds to be available for COVID-19 positive patients. CONCLUSION: The moratorium on elective surgical cases was timely and effective in creating bed capacity for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Further analyses will allow targeted resource allocation for future pandemic planning.","Prasad, Nikhil K; Englum, Brian R; Turner, Douglas J; Lake, Rachel; Siddiqui, Tariq; Mayorga-Carlin, Minerva; Sorkin, John D; K Lal, Brajesh",J Surg Res,95,16

Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment. RESULTS: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses.

The current study investigated a new CFD-based method of evaluating pressure-flow curves across a stenosis to further enhance the diagnostic value of cCTA imaging. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients who underwent both cCTA imaging and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) within 2 weeks were enrolled. The pressure-flow curve-derived parameters, viscous friction (VF) and expansion loss (EL), were compared with conventional cCTA parameters including percent area stenosis (AS) and minimum lumen area (MLA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. FFR &#8804; 0.80 was used to indicate ischemia-causing stenosis. Correlations between FFR and other measurements were calculated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho). RESULTS: Sixty-eight stenoses from 58 patients were analyzed. VF, EL, and AS were significantly larger in the group of FFR &#8804; 0.8 while smaller MLA values were observed. The ROC-AUC of VF (0.91, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) was better than that of AS (change in AUC (&#916;AUC) 0.27, p < 0.05) and MLA (&#916;AUC 0.17, p < 0.05), and ROC-AUC of EL (0.90, 95%CI 0.80-0.96) was also better than that of AS (&#916;AUC 0.26, p < 0.05) and MLA (&#916;AUC 0.16, p < 0.05). FFR values correlated well with VF (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001) and EL (rho = - 0.74 (95% CI - 0.83 to - 0.61, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Pressure-flow curve-derived parameters enhance the diagnostic value of cCTA examination. KEY POINTS: â¢ Pressure-flow curve derived from cCTA can assess coronary lesion severity. â¢ VF and EL are superior to cCTA alone for indicating ischemic lesions. â¢ Pressure-flow curve derived from cCTA may assist in clinical decision-making.","Xie, Xinzhou; Wen, Didi; Zhang, Ruichen; Tao, Qian; Wang, Ce; Xie, Songyun; Liu, Hui; Zheng, Minwen",Eur Radiol,95,16

While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur. OBJECTIVE: This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death. The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness. The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.

Pandemics and measures undertaken against them may cause changes in behavior; therefore, changes in injury patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak can be expected when compared to the parallel period in previous years. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare injury-related hospitalization patterns during the overall national lockdown period with parallel periods of previous years. METHODS: A retrospective study was completed of all patients hospitalized from March 15 through April 30, for years 2016-2020. Data were obtained from 21 hospitals included in the national trauma registry during the study years. Clinical, demographic, and circumstantial parameters were compared amongst the years of the study. RESULTS: The overall volume of injured patients significantly decreased during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the greatest decrease registered for road traffic collisions (RTCs). Patients' sex and ethnic compositions did not change, but a smaller proportion of children were hospitalized during the outbreak. Many more injuries were sustained at home during the outbreak, with proportions of injuries in all other localities significantly decreased. Injuries sustained during the COVID-19 outbreak were more severe, specifically due to an increase in severe injuries in RTCs and falls. The proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations did not change, however more surgeries were performed; patients stayed less days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in number of patients hospitalized due to trauma as compared to parallel periods of previous years. Nevertheless, trauma remains a major health care concern even during periods of high-impact disease outbreaks, in particular due to increased proportion of severe injuries and surgeries.","Rozenfeld, Michael; Peleg, Kobi; Givon, Adi; Bala, Miklosh; Shaked, Gad; Bahouth, Hany; Bodas, Moran",Prehosp Disaster Med,95,30

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the ""prediction model risk of bias assessment"" criteria and has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: Externally validate the C-19 index across a range of healthcare settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, Jenna M; Kim, Chungsoo; Williams, Ross D; Markus, Aniek F; Yang, Cynthia; Salles, Talita Duarte; Falconer, Thomas; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Williams, Andrew; Fernández-Bertolín, Sergio; DuVall, Scott L; Kostka, Kristin; Rao, Gowtham; Shoaibi, Azza; Ostropolets, Anna; Spotnitz, Matthew E; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Nyberg, Fredrik; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Choi, Young Hwa; Morales, Daniel; Liaw, Siaw-Teng; Abrahão, Maria Tereza Fernandes; Areia, Carlos; Matheny, Michael E; Aragón, María; Park, Rae Woong; Hripcsak, George; Reich, Christian G; Suchard, Marc A; You, Seng Chan; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter R",,95,17

The speciic focus of preventive measures is more on the susceptible population of children, healthcare providers, and older people. Many of the people practice safety measures without proper knowledge as to whether these measures are suficient or not to prevent the spread of the virus. It is therefore highly relevant to be aware of the preventive measures for Corona to practice it effectively. The primary preventive measures to be implemented are the regular practice of hygiene, social distancing, avoiding person-to-person contact, judicious use of masks, the practice of screening, and quarantine. Along with these, the usage of secondary preventive measures and avoidance of risk factors need to be exercised appropriately.

Still, comprehensive open data sets on urban green spaces are not available for most cities. As open and globally available data sets, the potential of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for urban green space mapping is high but limited due to their respective uncertainties. Sentinel-2 imagery cannot distinguish public from private green spaces and its spatial resolution of 10 m fails to capture fine-grained urban structures, while in OSM green spaces are not mapped consistently and with the same level of completeness everywhere. To address these limitations, we propose to fuse these data sets under explicit consideration of their uncertainties. The Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was fused with OSM data using the Dempster–Shafer theory to enhance the detection of small vegetated areas. The distinction between public and private green spaces was achieved using a Bayesian hierarchical model and OSM data. The analysis was performed based on land use parcels derived from OSM data and tested for the city of Dresden, Germany. The overall accuracy of the final map of public urban green spaces was 95% and was mainly influenced by the uncertainty of the public accessibility model.","Ludwig, Christina Hecht Robert Lautenbach Sven Schorcht Martin Zipf Alexander",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,95,24

However, there are secondary and tertiary public health effects stemming from the COVID 19 pandemic that requires attention and management. These include: psychological distress, loneliness, mental health issues, and domestic violence. Developing public health strategies associated with the COVID-19 pandemic requires sensitivity to unexpected outcomes, to sensemaking that explores beyond the direct effects but considers the second and third order effects.

If landfill leachate is to be treated using a combined ""biological + advanced treatment"" process, the molecular information of OM must be investigated to optimize the operation parameters of the combined process and maximize the removal of organic pollutants. This study applied ultra-high resolution mass spectroscopy to investigate the degradation and transformation characteristics of refractory OM in mature landfill leachate at the molecular level (m/z = 150-800) during biological treatment (i.e., semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter, SAARB) and subsequent chemical oxidation (i.e., the Fenton process and ozonation). After SAARB treatment, the polycyclic aromatics (aromatic index, AI > 0.66) and polyphenol (0.66 &#8805; AI > 0.50) contents increased, and the highly unsaturated phenolic compounds (AI &#8804; 0.50 and H/C < 1.5), which have a high bioavailability, were mostly removed. Compared with raw leachate, SAARB effluent (i.e., SAARB leachate) contained fewer organics with short carbon chains, more organics with long carbon chains, an elevated condensation degree for organics and, thus, a considerably reduced biodegradability. Although both the Fenton and ozonation processes could remove many of the polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols, ozone produced considerable amounts of aliphatic compounds with high bioavailability. Compared to ozonation, the Fenton process utilized the hydroxyl radical to non-selectively react with OM and produced better mineralization results.","Chen, Weiming; He, Chen; Gu, Zhepei; Wang, Fan; Li, Qibin",Sci Total Environ,95,1

Lessons from a Focus Topic Issue of Chemotherapy,14.972252,5.2306647,2021,"Background: The Colorado Pediatric Stroke Program provides comprehensive, multidisciplinary care for pediatric stroke patients and their families. The team, which includes dedicated inpatient and outpatient nurse coordinators, instituted a plan to support the transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting. Purpose: A survey was used to determine family preparedness for clinic and ease of scheduling their appointment. The data were collected before and after enacting remote scheduling and telehealth visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Our team provided educational materials and an outpatient appointment time to families at time of discharge starting in 2019. In January 2020, the stroke clinic staff surveyed parents and guardians about their preparedness for clinic. Telehealth encounters were initiated due to COVID-19 in March 2020, with staff conducting RedCAP surveys by telephone. The survey measured several components of visit preparedness and satisfaction including: understanding of diagnosis, reason for referral prior to clinic visit, familiarity with the stroke team prior to clinic visit, and ease in appointment scheduling. We compared results before and after March 2020 via two-tailed chisquare analysis or two-tailed Fischer's test. Results: Prior to telehealth, families favorably reported responses with 92% (47/52) knowing the reason for referral, 86% (42/49) receiving educational material prior to clinic, and 84% (42/50) reporting familiarity with our team. All patients (50/50) reported that scheduling was easy. Only scheduling ease had a significant change during the pandemic, with 11% (2/11) of patients reporting difficulties with scheduling after starting telehealth (P=0.03). Conclusion: Childhood stroke is a disease with significant morbidity and mortality, requiring close follow-up care. Families report robust preparedness for clinic after the implementation of a comprehensive discharge plan. Although small numbers, remote scheduling and telehealth transition may present previously unseen barriers to scheduling during the pandemic. During abrupt changes in clinical operations additional scheduling resources may be needed to ensure continuity of care.","Nederveld, C.; Thompson, V.; Murray, J.; Armstrong, J.

Lessons from a Focus Topic Issue of Chemotherapy,14.827966,5.3327928,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have had high rates of thrombosis. A novel condition in children infected with SARS-CoV-2, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has limited data on their prothrombotic state or need for thromboprophylaxis. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the prothrombotic state using coagulation profiles, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters and clinical outcomes, to determine if this could aid in risk stratification for thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: This analysis included patients (< 21 years of age) with a diagnosis of MIS-C (n=40) and controls (presenting with suspicion of MIS-C but later ruled out; n=26). RESULTS: MIS-C patients had higher levels of inflammatory markers including D-dimer (p<0.0001), compared to controls, along with evidence of hypercoagulability on ROTEM with elevated FIBTEM MCF (p<0.05). For MIS-C patients with D-dimers >1000 ng/mL, there was a significant correlation of FIBTEM MCF (p<0.0001) with a mean value of 37.4 (standard deviation 5.1). D-dimer >2144 ng/mL was predictive of intensive care unit admission (area under the curve (AUC) 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99; p<0.01; sensitivity: 82%, specificity: 75%), and elevated FIBTEM MCF (AUC 1 for >2500 ng/mL). MIS-C patients (50%) received enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (in addition to aspirin) with significant improvement in their inflammatory and ROTEM parameters upon outpatient follow up; none developed symptomatic thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an observed prothrombotic state, none of the MIS-C patients (on aspirin alone or in combination with enoxaparin) developed symptomatic thrombosis. ROTEM, in addition to coagulation profiles, may be helpful to tailor thromboprophylaxis in critically ill MIS-C patients.","Al-Ghafry, Maha; Vagrecha, Anshul; Malik, Marium; Levine, Chana; Uster, Eliza; Aygun, Banu; Appiah-Kubi, Abena; Vlachos, Adrianna; Capone, Christine A; Rajan, Sujatha; Palumbo, Nancy; Misra, Nilanjana; Mitchell, Elizabeth C; Wolfe, Lawrence C; Lipton, Jeffrey M; Shore-Lesserson, Linda; Acharya, Suchitra S",J. thromb. haemost,95,22

Coronavirus has now spread to all of the continents. We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS: Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P = 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P < 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P < 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.09, 8.21, P = 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03, P = 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.93, P = 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities. Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death. Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Javanian, Mostafa; Bayani, Masomeh; Shokri, Mehran; Sadeghi-Haddad-Zavareh, Mahmoud; Babazadeh, Arefeh; Yeganeh, Babak; Mohseni, Sima; Mehraeen, Rahele; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Bijani, Ali; Rostami, Ali; Shahbazi, Mehdi; Tabari, Afrooz Monadi; Shabani, Asieh; Masrour-Roudsari, Jila; Hasanpour, Amir Hossein; Gholinejad, Hossein Emam; Ghorbani, Hossein; Ebrahimpour, Soheil",Rom J Intern Med,95,1

In order to cope with the global pandemic situation and prevent the spread of the virus, various unprecedented precaution measures are adopted by different countries. One of the crucial practices to prevent the spread of viral infection is social distancing. This paper intends to present a social distance framework based on deep learning architecture as a precautionary step that helps to maintain, monitor, manage, and reduce the physical interaction between individuals in a real-time top view environment. We used Faster-RCNN for human detection in the images. As the human's appearance significantly varies in a top perspective; therefore, the architecture is trained on the top view human data set. Moreover, taking advantage of transfer learning, a new trained layer is fused with a pre-trained architecture. After detection, the pair-wise distance between peoples is estimated in an image using Euclidean distance. The detected bounding box's information is utilized to measure the central point of an individual detected bounding box. A violation threshold is defined that uses distance to pixel information and determines whether two people violate social distance or not. Experiments are conducted using various test images; results demonstrate that the framework effectively monitors the social distance between peoples. The transfer learning technique enhances the overall performance of the framework by achieving an accuracy of 96% with a False Positive Rate of 0.6%.","Ahmed, Imran; Ahmad, Misbah; Jeon, Gwanggil",Sustain Cities Soc,95,13

METHODS: Neurosurgical procedures, inpatient consultations, and outpatient appointments at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were identified from March 23, 2020 through May 8, 2020 (during COVID-19) and March 25, 2019 through May 10, 2019 (before COVID-19). The neurosurgical volume was compared between the 2 periods. RESULTS: A 40% reduction in weekly procedural volume was demonstrated during COVID-19 (median before, 75; interquartile range [IQR], 72-80; median during, 45; IQR, 43-47; P < 0.001). A 42% reduction occurred in weekly adult procedures (median before, 62; IQR, 54-70; median during, 36; IQR, 34-39; P < 0.001), and a 31% reduction occurred in weekly pediatric procedures (median before, 13; IQR, 12-14; median during, 9; IQR, 8-10; P = 0.004). Among adult procedures, the most significant decreases were seen for spine (P < 0.001) and endovascular (P < 0.001) procedures and cranioplasty (P < 0.001). A significant change was not found in the adult open vascular (P = 0.291), functional (P = 0.263), cranial tumor (P = 0.143), or hydrocephalus (P = 0.173) procedural volume. Weekly inpatient consultations to neurosurgery decreased by 24% (median before, 99; IQR, 94-114; median during, 75; IQR, 68-84; P = 0.008) for adults. Weekly in-person adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits witnessed a 91% decrease (median before, 329; IQR, 326-374; median during, 29; IQR, 26-39; P < 0.001). In contrast, weekly telehealth encounters increased from a median of 0 (IQR, 0-0) before to a median of 151 (IQR, 126-156) during COVID-19 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions occurred in neurosurgical operations, clinic visits, and inpatient consultations during COVID-19. Telehealth was increasingly used for assessments. The long-term effects of the reduced neurosurgical volume and increased telehealth usage on patient outcomes should be explored.","Patel, Pious D; Kelly, Katherine A; Reynolds, Rebecca A; Turer, Robert W; Salwi, Sanjana; Rosenbloom, S Trent; Bonfield, Christopher M; Naftel, Robert P",World Neurosurg,95,2

Based on the digital literacy framework by Martin and Grudziecki (2006), a study was developed aiming to identify university students' digital competences, as well as the uses and effects of digital literacy in the development of personal and social skills. Data collection, using an online questionnaire, took place during the initial closing period of HEIs in Portugal. The results point to an almost widespread mastery of search and data editing skills and to a lesser ability to create and develop new digital solutions. Most students reported that digital technologies were used (before the crisis)] mainly for institutional communication and between peers, but not for the development of networking and lifelong learning skills. The lack of involvement of many teachers in the available pedagogical support is an obstacle to an adequate digital transformation in higher education, both in times of crisis and in the future.","Monteiro, A.

For this reason, the volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and Dubai crude daily oil price data between 29 May 2006 and 31 March 2020 are analysed. Firstly, the presence of chaotic and nonlinear behaviour in the oil prices during the pandemic and the concurrent conflict is investigated by using the Shanon Entropy and Lyapunov exponent tests. The tests show that the oil prices exhibit chaotic behavior. Additionally, the current paper proposes a new hybrid modelling technique derived from the LSTARGARCH (Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model and LSTM (long-short term memory) method to analyse the volatility of oil prices. In the proposed LSTARGARCHLSTM method, GARCH modelling is applied to the crude oil prices in two regimes, where regime transitions are governed with an LSTAR-type smooth transition in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance. Separating the data into two regimes allows the efficient LSTM forecaster to adapt to and exploit the different statistical characteristics and ARCH and GARCH effects in each of the two regimes and yield better prediction performance over the case of its application to all the data. A comparison of our proposed method with the GARCH and LSTARGARCH methods for crude oil price data reveals that our proposed method achieves improved forecasting performance over the others in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) in the face of the chaotic structure of oil prices.","Bildirici, Melike; Bayazit, Nilgun Guler; Ucan, Yasemen",Energies,95,28

Its large infrastructures include four runways, a large taxiway network, and 298 aircraft parking stands (131 contact) among three terminals. With the current pandemic in place, the European air traffic network has declined by −65% flights when compared with 2019 traffic (pre-COVID-19), having a severe negative impact on the aviation indus-try. More and more often taxiways and runways are used as parking spaces for aircraft as conse-quence of the drastic decrease in air traffic. Furthermore, due to safety reasons, passenger terminals at many airports have been partially closed. In this work we want to study the effect of the reduction in the physical facilities at airports on airspace and airport capacity, especially in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) airspace, and in the airport ground side. We have developed a methodology that considers rare events such as the current pandemic, and evaluates reduced access to airport facilities, considers air traffic management restrictions and evaluates the capacity of airport ground side and airspace. We built scenarios based on real public information on the current use of the airport facilities of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and conducted different experiments based on current and hypothetical traffic recovery scenarios. An already known optimization metaheuris-tic was implemented for optimizing the traffic with the aim of avoiding airspace conflicts and avoiding capacity overloads on the ground side. The results show that the main bottleneck of the system is the terminal capacity, as it starts to become congested even at low traffic (35% of 2019 traffic). When the traffic starts to increase, a ground delay strategy is effective for mitigating airspace con-flicts;however, it reveals the need for additional runways. © 2021 by the authors.

However, on March 26, 2020, six leading medical organizations released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, hospitals around the United States and abroad are considering this technique out of desperation (eg, New York), but there is little data to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (VT). METHODS: We developed a lumped-parameter computational model of multiple patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance and resistance would impact VT under 4 ventilator settings of pressure control level, PEEP, breathing frequency, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio. RESULTS: Our computational model predicts VT within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by > 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Assigning patients to preset ventilators based on their required level of support on the lower PEEP/higher [Formula: see text] scale of the National Institute of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSNet), secondary to lung mechanics, could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any preclinical or clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient VT values.","Kheyfets, Vitaly O; Lammers, Steven R; Wagner, Jennifer; Bartels, Karsten; Piccoli, Jerome; Smith, Bradford J",Respir Care,95,24

This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed.","Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wang, Rui; Nguyen, Duc Duy; Wei, Guo-Wei",,95,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for many populations including people with disabilities, and data is needed to develop inclusive public health response policies. OBJECTIVE: To identify how COVID-19 has uniquely impacted the lives of adults with disabilities. METHODS: 38 participants were recruited through disability advocacy groups and social media. Semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted with adults (&#8805;18 years) who self-identified as having a disability. Focus groups were conducted for each of six disability sub-groups: vision, hearing, mobility and physical, mental health, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental, and chronic illness. Using inductive coding, major themes were identified and compared across the disability sub-groups. RESULTS: Three major themes and thirteen sub-themes were identified from the focus groups. The three major themes comprised: new problems created by the pandemic, obstacles in daily life that were exacerbated by the pandemic, and broader changes to accessibility and disability identity. Sub-themes such as difficulty with COVID-19 testing and regular medical care were reported by participants of all disability sub-groups, while other sub-themes like direct care needs and medical rationing were reported by participants from a subset of the disability sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic unequally impacts disabled people. The participants indicated that to fully address their needs, disability perspectives must be included in the public health pandemic response. As new research shows that COVID-19 can cause long-term disability, the urgency to ensure the disability community is part of public health policies will increase.","Epstein, Sabrina; Campanile, Jessica; Cerilli, Caroline; Gajwani, Prateek; Varadaraj, Varshini; Swenor, Bonnielin K",Disabil Health J,95,1

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of ARDS. Thus, extracellular bacteria play an important role in the pathophysiology of ARDS. Overactivated neutrophils are the major effector cells in ARDS. Thus, extracellular bacteria triggered TH17-like innate immunity with neutrophil activation might accounts for the etiology of ARDS. Here, microarray analysis was employed to describe TH17-like innate immunity-related cytokine including TGF-{\beta} and IL-6 up-regulation in whole blood of ARDS patients. It was found that the innate TH17-related TLR1,2,4,5,8, HSP70, G-CSF, GM-CSF, complements, defensin, PMN chemokines, cathepsins, Fc receptors, NCFs, FOS, JunB, CEBPs, NFkB, and leukotriene B4 are all up-regulated. TGF-{\beta} secreting Treg cells play important roles in lung fibrosis. Up-regulation of Treg associated STAT5B and TGF-{\beta} with down-regulation of MHC genes, TCR genes, and co-stimulation molecule CD86 are noted. Key TH17 transcription factors, STAT3 and ROR{\alpha}, are down-regulated. Thus, the full adaptive TH17 helper CD4 T cells may not be successfully triggered. Many fibrosis promoting genes are also up-regulated including MMP8, MMP9, FGF13, TIMP1, TIMP2, PLOD1, P4HB, P4HA1, PDGFC, HMMR, HS2ST1, CHSY1, and CSGALNACT. Failure to induce successful adaptive immunity could also attribute to ARDS pathogenesis. Thus, ARDS is actually a TH17-like and Treg immune disorder.","Hu, Wan-Chung",,95,26

The objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of cancer diagnoses in primary care. DESIGN: Time-series study of malignant neoplasms and diagnostic procedures, using data from the primary care electronic health records from January 2014 to September 2020. SETTING: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: People older than 14 years and assigned in one of the primary care practices of the Catalan Institute of Health with a new diagnosis of malignant neoplasm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We obtained the monthly expected incidence of malignant neoplasms using a temporary regression, where the response variable was the incidence of cancer from 2014 to 2018 and the adjustment variables were the trend and seasonality of the time series. Excess or lack of malignant neoplasms was defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, globally and stratified by sex, age, type of cancer and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Between March and September 2020 we observed 8766 (95% CI 4135 to 13 397) fewer malignant neoplasm diagnoses, representing a reduction of 34% (95% CI 19.5% to 44.1%) compared with the expected. This underdiagnosis was greater in individuals aged older than 64 years, men and in some types of cancers (skin, colorectal, prostate). Although the reduction was predominantly focused during the lockdown, expected figures have not yet been reached (40.5% reduction during the lockdown and 24.3% reduction after that). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in cancer incidence has been observed during and after the lockdown. Urgent policy interventions are necessary to mitigate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures on other diseases and some strategies must be designed in order to reduce the underdiagnosis of cancer.","Coma, Ermengol; Guiriguet, Carolina; Mora, Nuria; Marzo-Castillejo, Mercè; Benítez, Mencia; Méndez-Boo, Leonardo; Fina, Francesc; Fàbregas, Mireia; Mercadé, Albert; Medina, Manuel",BMJ Open,95,1

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rohani, P.; Badi, S. A.; Moshiri, A.; Siadat, S.

Vaccine-associated enhanced disease has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. Although animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may elucidate mechanisms of immune protection, we need observations of enhanced disease in people receiving candidate COVID-19 vaccines to understand the risk of immune enhancement of disease. Neither principles of immunity nor preclinical studies provide a basis for prioritizing among the COVID-19 vaccine candidates with respect to safety at this time.

Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed. RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.","Dhiman, Yashaswi; Coshic, Poonam; Pandey, Hem Chandra; Khatiwada, Basanta; Singh, Jasmeet; Mehta, Vikas; Gupta, Sanjay",Transfus. med,95,1

Additionally, the literature is inconsistent regarding the waning effect of the serological response. The aim of this study was to explore the temporal dynamic changes of the immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized and non-hospitalized symptomatic patients over a period of 10 months. Six different analytical kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection were used. Positivity rates, inter-assay agreement and kinetic models were determined. A high inter-individual and an inter-methodology variability was observed. Assays targeting total antibodies presented higher positivity rates and reached the highest positivity rates sooner compared with assays directed against IgG. The inter-assay agreement was also higher between these assays. The stratification by disease severity showed a much-elevated serological response in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients in all assays. In this 10-month follow-up study, serological assays showed a clinically significant difference to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infection with total antibody assays presenting the highest positivity rates. The waning effect reported in several studies should be interpreted with caution because it could depend on the assay considered.","Favresse, Julien; Eucher, Christine; Elsen, Marc; Gillot, Constant; Van Eeckhoudt, Sandrine; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan",,95,26

To address this, we used a previously published model, combined with neutralization data for four vaccines - mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, NVX-CoV2373, and CoronaVac - to evaluate long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibody and to predict time-varying efficacy against the Delta variant by specific vaccine, age group, and clinical severity. We found that booster vaccination produces higher neutralization titers compared with titers observed following primary-series vaccination for all vaccines studied. We estimate the efficacies of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 against Delta variant infection to be 63.5% (95%CI: 51.4-67.3%) and 78.4% (95%CI: 72.2-83.5%), respectively, 14-30 days after the second dose, and that efficacies decreased to 36.0% (95%CI: 24.1-58.0%) and 38.5% (95%CI: 28.7-49.1%) 6-8 months later. After administration of booster doses, efficacies against the Delta variant would be 97.0% (95%CI: 96.4-98.5%) and 97.2% (95.7-98.1%). All four vaccines are predicted to provide good protection against severe illness from the Delta variant after both primary and booster vaccination.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and describe the prevalence of food insecurity at a public university before and after the onset of Covid-19 as well as factors associated with any change in food security. Researchers administered a cross-sectional, non-probability survey to college students (n = 3206) that assessed food security status prior to and after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as questions related to various sociodemographic characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Thirty-eight percent of students experienced a change in food security as a result of the pandemic, with 59.6% becoming less food secure, and 40.4% becoming more food secure. Characteristics that were associated with changes in food security included changes in housing and employment status as a result of the pandemic. These findings suggest that the pandemic led to changes in food security among college students, and that economic relief efforts should include college students, who are disproportionately affected by food insecurity.","Mialki, Kaley; House, Lisa A; Mathews, Anne E; Shelnutt, Karla P",Nutrients,95,16

Methods: From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Results: A total of 43 patients were included. The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection. Of these viruses, influenza virus (n = 8) and adenovirus (n = 7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus, human enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Compared with nonviral nonresponding CAP, only ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a more common imaging manifestation in viral nonresponding CAP. However, no obvious differences were found in clinical and laboratory findings between the presence and the absence of viral infections. Conclusions: Viral infections were particularly frequent in adults with nonresponding CAP.

We characterize visits with respect to symptoms and testing in the outpatient setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of sick visits in a pediatric academic primary care clinic April-August 2020. We included possible COVID-19 cases, or ""persons under investigation"" (PUIs), recording symptoms, positive contacts, and COVID-19 testing. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for comparisons were used. RESULTS: 32% (476/1,474) of sick visits were PUIs;20% were telehealth. Symptoms most commonly reported were fever, congestion/rhinorrhea and cough. 76% of PUIs were tested for COVID-19. Only presence of COVID-19 contacts and loss of taste/smell were significantly associated with positive tests (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Nearly a third of sick visits in an academic pediatric practice were seen for possible COVID-19 symptoms and most were tested. The majority with and without COVID-19 had fever, congestion and/or cough. Our findings suggest low thresholds for testing in children.","Riese, A.; Kelly, J. M.; Chu, T.

This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the percent increase in COVID-19 cases. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 38 districts of India were collected between 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Taking a 5-day time lag of average values of the variables and multiple days-samples, we ran multiple models and performed appropriate hypothesis tests to decide the single preferred model for each sample data. Suitable fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models with cluster-robust standard errors were applied to quantify the district-specific associations of meteorological and other variables with COVID-19 cases. Results: All FE models revealed that every one-degree rise in AT led to a decrease in 3.909 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. All RE models showed that with one unit increase in the malaria annual parasite index, there was a significant increase in 10.835 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. In both FE and RE models, ARH was found to be negatively associated with a percent increase in COVID-19 cases, although in half of these models the association was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Our results indicate that mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and malaria endemicity might have an essential role in the stability and transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus.","Panigrahi, Ansuman; Mohapatra, Ipsa; Kanyari, S Suneeti; Maharana, Sabita; Panigrahi, Madhulita",Arch Environ Occup Health,95,33

Currently, there is no consensus on the technical standards for LPD. Objective: The aim of this consensus statement is to guide the continued safe progression and adoption of LPD. Evidence Review: An international panel of experts was selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Statements were produced upon reviewing the literature and assessed by the members of the expert panel. The literature search and its critical appraisal were limited to articles published in English during the period from 1994 to 2019. The Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched, The search strategy included, but was not limited to, the terms 'laparoscopic', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy, 'pancreatoduodenectomy', 'Whipple's operation', and 'minimally invasive surgery'. Reference lists from the included articles were manually checked for any additional studies, which were included when appropriate. Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument was applied to assess the methodological quality and externally validate the final statements. The statements were further discussed during a one-day face-to-face meeting at the 1st Summit on Minimally Invasive Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery in Wuhan, China. Findings: Twenty-eight international experts from 8 countries constructed the expert panel. Sixteen statements were produced by the members of the expert panel. At least 80% of responders agreed with the majority (80%) of statements. Other than three randomized controlled trials published to date, most evidences were based on level 3 or 4 studies according to the AGREE II-GRS Instrument. Conclusions and Relevance: The Wuhan international expert consensus meeting on LPD has produced a set of clinical practice statements for the safe development and progression of LPD. LPD is currently in its development and exploration stages, as defined by the international IDEAL framework for surgical innovation. More robust randomized controlled trial and registry study are essential to proceed with the assessment of LPD.","Qin, Renyi; Kendrick, Michael L; Wolfgang, Christopher L; Edil, Barish H; Palanivelu, Chinnusamy; Parks, Rowan W; Yang, Yinmo; He, Jin; Zhang, Taiping; Mou, Yiping; Yu, Xianjun; Peng, Bing; Senthilnathan, Palanisamy; Han, Ho-Seong; Lee, Jae Hoon; Unno, Michiaki; Damink, Steven W M Olde; Bansal, Virinder Kumar; Chow, Pierce; Cheung, Tan To; Choi, Nim; Tien, Yu-Wen; Wang, Chengfeng; Fok, Manson; Cai, Xiujun; Zou, Shengquan; Peng, Shuyou; Zhao, Yupei",Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr,95,15

Modifications include those made to improve patient and healthcare worker safety such as the use of personal protective equipment. Pharmacy services, specifically pharmacy transitions of care services have not been immune to change which have brought along their own set of unique challenges to consider. This paper discusses how COVID-19 has impacted the delivery of pharmacy transitions of care services with real world examples from Sharp Grossmont Hospital and Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. Procedures implemented to minimize the spread and contraction of COVID-19 such as minimized patient contact and altered visitor policies have made it more challenging to obtain a best possible medication list the patient was taking prior to arrival to the hospital which has lead to an increased reliance on secondary sources to complete medication histories. Regarding discharge prescriptions, preference has shifted to the use of electronic vs. hard copy prescriptions, mail order, and utilization of med to bed programs and other hospital medication delivery services to limit patient contact in outpatient pharmacies. An improved effort to resolve medication acquisition issues prior to discharge utilizing patient assistance programs and other hospital programs to cover the cost of medications for COVID positive patients under certain circumstances has been seen. This paper highlights the important role pharmacists can play in providing effective communication, supporting continuity of care, and advocating for patient engagement and empowerment during transitions of care in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Herzik, Kristen A; Bethishou, Laressa",Res Social Adm Pharm,95,1

Yet although software production is amenable to remote collaboration and its outputs are easily shared across distances, software development seems to cluster geographically in places such as Silicon Valley, London, or Berlin. And while recent work indicates that OSS activity creates positive externalities which accrue locally through knowledge spillovers and information effects, up-to-date data on the geographic distribution of active open source developers is limited. This presents a significant blindspot for policymakers, who tend to promote OSS at the national level as a cost-saving tool for public sector institutions. We address this gap by geolocating more than half a million active contributors to GitHub in early 2021 at various spatial scales. Compared to results from 2010, we find a significant increase in the share of developers based in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, suggesting a more even spread of OSS developers globally. Within countries, however, we find significant concentration in regions, exceeding the concentration of workers in high-tech fields. Social and economic development indicators predict at most half of regional variation in OSS activity in the EU, suggesting that clusters of OSS have idiosyncratic roots. We argue that policymakers seeking to foster OSS should focus locally rather than nationally, using the tools of cluster policy to support networks of OSS developers.","Wachs, Johannes; Nitecki, Mariusz; Schueller, William; Polleres, Axel",,95,16

There are more limited data for systemic thromboembolism. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of systemic and venous thromboembolism as well as major bleeding and mortality in relation to underlying risk factors and the impact of anticoagulation use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China between January 08, 2020 and April 7, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to determine associated risk factors for clinical events, adjusting for the severity of COVID-19 infection, drug therapies, comorbidities, surgery, and use of antithrombotic drugs. There were 1125 patients (49.9% male; mean age 58 years (standard deviation, SD, 15 years)) with a mean follow-up of 21 (SD 13) days. Approximately 25 (30%) patients with thromboembolism also suffered bleeding events. Age was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, bleeding events, and death (all p<0.05). After adjusting for the severity of COVID-19 infection, comorbidities, surgery, antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, Chinese herbs, and antithrombotic drugs, low lymphocyte counts (hazard ratio, HR, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03, 1.01-1.05, p=0.01) and surgery (HR 2.80, 1.08-7.29, p=0.03) independently predicted the risk for major bleeding, whereas liver dysfunction (HR 4.13, 1.30-13.1, p=0.02) was an independent risk factor for patients with both thromboembolism and bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 were at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events as well as mortality. The use of anticoagulants, especially parenteral anticoagulants, significantly reduced the risk for composite outcomes of thromboembolism, bleeding events, and death. The presence of AF was a contributor to systemic thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Wencheng; Xu, Zhifeng; Xiang, Huiling; Zhang, Chun; Guo, Yutao; Xiong, Jing",Aging (Albany NY),95,1

Psychological measures were assessed before and up to 2 years after the implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were enrolled in this monocentric prospective study (44/88 CRT-D/ICD, mean age 61 ± 14 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 31 ± 9%, and 29% women). Psychological assessment was performed before device implantation as well as after 5, 12, and 24 months. After device implantation, mean total HFA, HFA-fear, HFA-attention, general anxiety, and QoL improved significantly. Depression and HFA-related avoidance of physical activity did not change. CRT-D patients compared with ICD recipients and women compared with men reported worse QoL at baseline. Younger patients (<median of 63 years) had higher levels of general anxiety and lower levels of HFA-avoidance at baseline than older patients. After 24 months, groups no longer differed from each other on these scores. Patients with a history of shock or anti-tachycardia pacing (shock/ATP; N = 19) reported no improvements in psychological measures and had significantly higher total HFA and HFA-avoidance levels after 2 years than participants without shock/ATP. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and QoL improved after device implantation, and depression and HFA-avoidance remained unchanged. HFA may be more pronounced after shock/ATP. Psychological counselling in these patients to reduce HFA and increase physical activity should be considered.","Kindermann, Ingrid; Wedegärtner, Sonja Maria; Bernhard, Benedikt; Ukena, Julia; Lenski, Denise; Karbach, Julia; Schwantke, Igor; Ukena, Christian; Böhm, Michael",ESC Heart Fail,95,15

It documents that authorities around the world have taken a diverse array of measures to mitigate financial distress in the markets and for borrowers, and to support the provision of critical financial services to the real economy. Using Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regressions, the paper takes initial steps to analyze the determinants of policy makers’ responsiveness and activity in emerging markets and developing economies, respectively. The results indicate that policy makers in richer and more populous countries have been significantly more responsive and have taken more policy measures. Belonging to a monetary union is also significantly associated with a faster and more frequent intervention. Countries with higher private debt levels tend to respond earlier with banking sector and liquidity and funding measures. The spread of COVID-19, macro-financial fundamentals, pressure on foreign exchange markets, political settings, and fiscal and containment policies appear to play a limited role in determining policy response. In a substantially smaller sample, the paper explores the role of banking sector characteristics and finds that emerging markets and developing economies with higher private bank credit to GDP and that have adopted Basel III reforms have taken fewer policy measures.","Feyen, Erik Alonso Gispert Tatiana Kliatskova Tatsiana Mare Davide S.",Journal of Banking &amp; Finance,95,5

The significance of the presence and infectivity of this virus on environmental surfaces, especially in a hospital setting, remains less clear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze surface swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectivity, and to determine their suitability for sequence analysis. METHODS: Samples were collected during two waves of COVID-19 at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, in COVID-19 patient serving and staff congregation areas. qRT-PCR positive samples were investigated in Vero cell cultures for cytopathic effects and phylogenetically assessed by whole genome sequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission. Ours is the first report on recovering near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences directly from environmental surface swabs.","Coil, David A; Albertson, Timothy; Banerjee, Shefali; Brennan, Greg; Campbell, A J; Cohen, Stuart H; Dandekar, Satya; Díaz-Muñoz, Samuel L; Eisen, Jonathan A; Goldstein, Tracey; Jose, Ivy R; Juarez, Maya; Robinson, Brandt A; Rothenburg, Stefan; Sandrock, Christian; Stoian, Ana M M; Tompkins, Daniel G; Tremeau-Bravard, Alexandre; Haczku, Angela",PLoS One,95,14

Nevertheless, the unified European energy market promotes the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) by the regional energy system operators. Consequently, RES forecasting can assist in the integration of these volatile energy sources, since it leads to higher reliability and reduced ancillary operational costs for power systems. This paper presents a new dataset for solar and wind energy generation forecast in Greece and introduces a feature engineering pipeline that enriches the dimensional space of the dataset. In addition, we propose a novel method that utilizes the innovative Prophet model, an end-to-end forecasting tool that considers several kinds of nonlinear trends in decomposing the energy time series before a tree-based ensemble provides short-term predictions.

The development of targeted drugs is held back due to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the perturbation of cell physiology observed after viral infection. Recently, several approaches, aimed at identifying cellular proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 pathology, have been reported. Albeit valuable, this information offers limited mechanistic insight as these efforts have produced long lists of cellular proteins, the majority of which are not annotated to any cellular pathway. We have embarked in a project aimed at bridging this mechanistic gap by developing a new bioinformatic approach to estimate the functional distance between a subset of proteins and a list of pathways. A comprehensive literature search allowed us to annotate, in the SIGNOR 2.0 resource, causal information underlying the main molecular mechanisms through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related coronaviruses affect the host-cell physiology. Next, we developed a new strategy that enabled us to link SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins to cellular phenotypes via paths of causal relationships. Remarkably, the extensive information about inhibitors of signaling proteins annotated in SIGNOR 2.0 makes it possible to formulate new potential therapeutic strategies. The proposed approach, which is generally applicable, generated a literature-based causal network that can be used as a framework to formulate informed mechanistic hypotheses on COVID-19 etiology and pathology.","Perfetto, Livia; Micarelli, Elisa; Iannuccelli, Marta; Lo Surdo, Prisca; Giuliani, Giulio; Latini, Sara; Pugliese, Giusj Monia; Massacci, Giorgia; Vumbaca, Simone; Riccio, Federica; Fuoco, Claudia; Paoluzi, Serena; Castagnoli, Luisa; Cesareni, Gianni; Licata, Luana; Sacco, Francesca",,95,16

441368,441368,441368,Covid-19 vaccine trials: Ethnic diversity and immunogenicity,14.739465,5.6096663,2021,"BACKGROUND: Great efforts have been made to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including national initiatives to promote the change of personal behaviors. The lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak indicate that knowledge and attitudes about infectious diseases are related to panic among the population, which may further complicate efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Misunderstandings may result in behaviors such as underestimation, panic, and taking ineffective measures to avoid infection; these behaviors are likely to cause the epidemic to spread further. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess public health perceptions and misunderstandings about COVID-19 in China, and to propose targeted response measures based on the findings to control the development of the epidemic. METHODS: The study was conducted in April 2020 through an online survey, with participants in 8 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China. We designed a questionnaire with a health knowledge section consisting of 5 questions (4 conventional questions and 1 misleading question) on clinical features of and preventive measures against COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, binary logistic regression, and Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In total, 4788 participants completed the survey and the mean knowledge score was 4.63 (SD 0.67), gained mainly through experts (76.1%), television (60.0%), newspapers (57.9%), and opinions (46.6%) and videos (42.9%) from social media. Compared to those who obtained information from only 1 or 2 channels, people who obtained information from >3 channels had increased health perception and a better ability to identify misleading information. Suggestions from experts were the most positive information source (&#967;2=41.61), while information on social media was the most misleading. Those aged >60 years (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10-2.11), those with a lower or middle income (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.00-1.83), those not working and not able to work (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04-3.21), those with a household income <100,000 RMB (<US $14,954; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.67), and those with >2 suspected symptoms (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.50-5.80) were more likely to be misled by videos on social media, but the error correction effect of expert advice was limited in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple information channels can improve public health perception and the identification of misleading information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos on social media increased the risk of rumor propagation among vulnerable groups. We suggest the government should strengthen social media regulation and increase experts' influence on the targeted vulnerable populations to reduce the risk of rumors spreading.","Zhou, Jiawei; Ghose, Bishwajit; Wang, Ruoxi; Wu, Ruijun; Li, Zhifei; Huang, Rui; Feng, Da; Feng, Zhanchun; Tang, Shangfeng",J Med Internet Res,95,33

Public sentiment analysis during the outbreak provides insightful information in making appropriate public health responses. On Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social media, posts with negative sentiment are valuable in analyzing public concerns. 999,978 randomly selected COVID-19 related Weibo posts from 1 January 2020 to 18 February 2020 are analyzed. Specifically, the unsupervised BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is adopted to classify sentiment categories (positive, neutral, and negative) and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) model is used to summarize the topics of posts. Trend analysis and thematic analysis are conducted to identify characteristics of negative sentiment. In general, the fine-tuned BERT conducts sentiment classification with considerable accuracy. Besides, topics extracted by TF-IDF precisely convey characteristics of posts regarding COVID-19. As a result, we observed that people concern four aspects regarding COVID-19, the virus Origin (Gamey Food, 3.08%; Bat, 2.70%; Conspiracy Theory, 1.43%), Symptom (Fever, 2.13%; Cough, 1.19%), Production Activity (Go to Work, 1.94%; Resume Work, 1.12%; School New Semester Beginning, 1.06%) and Public Health Control (Temperature Taking, 1.39%; Coronavirus Cover-up, 1.26%; City Shutdown, 1.09%).

In most countries, governments have been willing to act decisively to implement costly restrictions on work and personal life, to a degree that has never been observed for an environmental issue. A number of possible lessons for environmental economists are identified. In addition to valuing natural environments, people also place a high value on social interactions. These two values may interact. Adaptation can substantially reduce the cost of restrictive policies and should be considered when policy proposals are being evaluated. Preparation for an emergency can substantially reduce its costs by allowing a more rapid response. The development of new technologies can play a key role in reducing externalities.

This study evaluated the efficacy of chest CT to predict disease progression, pulmonary complications, and viral positivity duration. METHODS: A single-center cohort study was conducted by consecutively including hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The chest CT patterns were described and a total severity score was calculated. The predictive accuracy of the severity score was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis, while a Cox proportional hazards regression model was implemented to identify the radiological features that are linked to prolonged duration of viral positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients were included with 10 of them requiring intensive care unit admission. The most common lesions were ground glass opacities (92.9%), consolidation (66.7%), and crazy-paving patterns (61.9%). The total severity score significantly correlated with inflammatory and respiratory distress markers, as well as with admission CURB-65 and PSI/PORT scores. It was estimated to predict critical illness with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 70%, respectively. Time-to-event analysis indicated that patients without ground-glass opacities presented significantly shorter median viral positivity (16 vs. 27 days). CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT severity score positively correlates with markers of COVID-19 severity and presents promising efficacy in predicting critical illness. It is suggested that ground-glass opacities are linked to prolonged viral positivity. Further studies should confirm the efficacy of the severity score and elucidate the long-term pulmonary effects of COVID-19.","Bellos, Ioannis; Tavernaraki, Kyriaki; Stefanidis, Konstantinos; Michalopoulou, Olympia; Lourida, Giota; Korompoki, Eleni; Thanou, Ioanna; Thanos, Loukas; Pefanis, Angelos; Argyraki, Aikaterini",Respir Investig,95,26

Commercial spore carriers (CSC) coated with 106 spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are often used to assess the efficacy of disinfection. We used quantitative carrier testing (QCT) procedures to compare the sensitivity of CSC with that of surrogates for non-enveloped and enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, mycobacteria, and spores to an aerosolized mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (aPAA/HP). We then used the QCT methodology to determine relevant process parameters to develop and validate effective disinfection protocols (&#8805; 4 log10 reduction) in various large and complex facilities. Our results demonstrate that aPAA/HP is a highly efficient procedure for airborne room disinfection. Relevant process parameters such as temperature and relative humidity can be wirelessly monitored. Furthermore, we found striking differences in inactivation efficacies against some of the tested microorganisms.Overall, we conclude that dry fogging a mixture of aPAA/HP is highly efficient against a broad range of microorganisms as well as material compatible with relevant concentrations. Furthermore, CSC are artificial bio-indicators with lower resistance and thus, should not be used for validating airborne disinfection when microorganisms other than viruses have to be inactivated.IMPORTANCE Airborne disinfection is not only of crucial importance for the safe operation of laboratories and animal rooms where infectious agents are handled, but can also be used in public health emergencies like the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We show that dry fogging a mixture of aPAA/HP is highly microbicidal, efficient, fast, robust, environmentally neutral, and a suitable airborne disinfection method. In addition, the low concentration of dispersed disinfectant, particularly for enveloped viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, entails high material compatibility. For these reasons and due to the relative simplicity of the procedure, it is an ideal disinfection method for hospital wards, ambulances, public conveyances and indoor community areas. Thus, we conclude that this method is an excellent choice for control of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Schinköthe, Jan; Scheinemann, Hendrik A; Diederich, Sandra; Freese, Holger; Eschbaumer, Michael; Teifke, Jens P; Reiche, Sven",,95,1

We evaluate and compare the performance of the random forest (RF) and regularized logistic regression (LR) as feature selection tools and classification approaches for wakefulness OSA screening. Results show that the RF, which is a low-variance committee-based approach, outperforms the regularized LR in terms of blind-testing accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity with 3.5%, 2.4%, and 3.7% improvement, respectively. However, the regularized LR was found to be faster than the RF and resulted in a more parsimonious model. Consequently, both the RF and regularized LR feature reduction and classification approaches are qualified to be applied for the daytime OSA screening studies, depending on the nature of data and applications' purposes.

In the experiment at 30 °C with a batch reactor (700 mL), biomass growth was mostly as immobilized attached cells, and the achieved 1,3-PDO yield was up to 0.58 mol mol-gly-1. In the experiment (30 °C) with an upflow anaerobic reactor (717 mL), glycerol loading rates (gly-LR) ranging from 6.94 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1 were applied during a 102-day period. During the operation, average 1,3-PDO yield was 0.47 mol mol-gly-1, reaching a maximum of 0.51 mol mol-gly-1 at gly-LR of 13.57 g gly L-1 day-1. High 1,3-PDO productivity (5.35 to 5.44 g L-1 day-1) was obtained when gly-LR was 13.57 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1. Comparing the close yield values in both batch and continuous reactors and based on microbial evaluation, it is concluded that most of the 1,3-PDO generated in the continuous reactor was due to the suspended biomass retained by the foam cubes. The Clostridium genus was the predominant 1,3-PDO producer. Good yields and productivities with packed reactors were attributed to polyurethane foam used for mixed culture growth and retention.

To assess the potential impact on UK fish species, Atlantic salmon, common carp and goldfish were exposed to the virus via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection and bath challenge. Moribundity was recorded in only 8% of IP-injected goldfish. A high viral load, &#8776;107 of the CSBV PpIa gene, was measured in the kidney of moribund goldfish. Mild histopathological changes were observed in the kidneys of challenged carps.

Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of therapeutic and vaccine development; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the virus's inability to use the mouse orthologue of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and exhibit pathological findings found in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we show that type I interferons do not control SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo but are significant drivers of pathological responses. Thus, the AAV-hACE2 mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds.","Israelow, Benjamin; Song, Eric; Mao, Tianyang; Lu, Peiwen; Meir, Amit; Liu, Feimei; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Wei, Jin; Dong, Huiping; Homer, Robert J; Ring, Aaron; Wilen, Craig B; Iwasaki, Akiko",J. exp. med,95,16

SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The disease has a moderate and severe course in approximately 20% of the patients and mortality reaches up to 62% among these patients(2). The majority of the patients develop SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and manifestations of pneumonia rapidly progress to respiratory failure. In severe Covid pneumonia, it has been demonstrated that increased plasma concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-12 are involved in immune response and in cytokine storm caused by the increase in these cytokines lead to mortality(1, 3). Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a promising agent that is used for the treatment of cytokine storm. TCZ is an IgG1 class recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor(3). It has then been used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Due to its mechanism of action, TCZ treatment comes to the forefront particularly in cases of severe COVID-19-induced cytokine pneumonia presenting with cytokine storm(3). However, potential IgE-mediated immunological reactions against this drug, especially anaphylaxis, may deprive these patients of an important treatment option for the treatment of COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Although TCZ-induced anaphylaxis has been reported as case reports of indicated rheumatic diseases, TCZ-induced anaphylaxis has not yet been reported in patients using TCZ for SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storms(4). In this case series, we aimed to represent cases of anaphylaxis which developed in two different patients using TCZ for SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm.","Atayik, E.; Aytekin, G.",Journal of Emergency Medicine Case Reports,95,1

Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide. We aimed to present acute pancreatitis (AP) cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Methods. The study was conducted retrospectively between April 2020 and June 2020 in Necmettin Erbakan University Meram, Medical Faculty Hospital, and 150 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. The degree of acute pancreatitis was determined according to the Atlanta classification. Organ failures of the patients were evaluated in terms of respiratory, cardiovascular, and nephrology according to the modified Marshall scoring (MMS) system, and CTSI (Balthazar score) and Imrie score were determined. Modified Marshall score ≥ 2 was considered organ failure. Results. A total of 29 patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. All 29 patients with pancreatitis had respiratory failure during hospitalization. After the diagnosis of pancreatitis, there was no change in respiratory failure. According to the Atlanta classification, 19 patients had mild AP and 10 patients had moderate AP. Patients with acute pancreatitis were scored according to the CTSI (Balthazar score), and there were no patients with ≥6 severe pancreatitis. The CTSI score of 4 patients was 3. In addition, the Imrie score of the patients was determined and 8 patients with Imrie score ≥ 3 were identified. Conclusion. The rate of pancreatic damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 19% (n = 29) in our study. In our study, we highlight acute pancreatitis as a complication associated with COVID-19 and the importance of pancreatic evaluation in patients with COVID-19 and abdominal pain is demonstrated.","Vatansev, Hulya Yıldırım Mehmet Aykut Kuccukturk Serkan Karaselek Mehmet Ali Kadiyoran Cengiz",Gastroenterology Research &amp; Practice,95,7

Subsequently, an additional approach to the traditional mitigation strategies was to be proposed. Methods: A total of 173 Portuguese practitioners on indoor physical activity or sports before pandemic participated in this study. A questionnaire asking how much concerned (1 - nothing, to 5 - completely) would they be on different contexts and aspects related to this return was applied. Results: respondents were considerably concerned about this theme, especially with touching on common surfaces and proximity to others. Although considerable concerned if having to travel by public transport to the training facility, using locker rooms and with features of the sports’ practice itself, the former received the highest concerns. Additionally, we have suggested modifying some objects (or creating others) that may allow their use with body parts other than hands - an important contagion source - and exploiting the possibility of using intermediate instruments on objects and sports equipment manipulation, preventing users from touching their surfaces directly. Conclusion: touching on common surfaces and proximity to others revealed high degrees of concern on the return to indoor sports practice after confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside the rules of personal distancing, respiratory etiquette and surfaces hygiene, it is suggested that sports practitioners, whenever possible, use alternative body parts and intermediate instruments that avoid direct contact of hands with surfaces and sport objects. © 2021 Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.

METHODS: A retrospective study including COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian hospital between March 1 and July 1, 2020. Predictors of viral clearance (VC) and prolonged VS from the upper respiratory tract were assessed by Poisson regression and logistic regression analyses. The causal relation between VS and clinical outcomes was evaluated through an inverse probability weighted Cox model. RESULTS: The study included 536 subjects. The median duration of VS from symptoms onset was 18 days. The estimated 30-day probability of VC was 70.2%. Patients with comorbidities, lymphopenia at hospital admission, or moderate/severe respiratory disease had a lower chance of VC. The development of moderate/severe respiratory failure, delayed hospital admission after symptoms onset, baseline comorbidities, or D-dimer >1000ng/mL at admission independently predicted prolonged VS. The achievement of VC doubled the chance of clinical recovery and reduced the probability of death/mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disease severity, comorbidities, delayed hospital admission and inflammatory markers negatively predicted VC, which resulted to be associated with better clinical outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of prompt hospitalization of symptomatic patients, especially where signs of severity or comorbidities are present.","Mondi, Annalisa; Lorenzini, Patrizia; Castilletti, Concetta; Gagliardini, Roberta; Lalle, Eleonora; Corpolongo, Angela; Valli, Maria Beatrice; Taglietti, Fabrizio; Cicalini, Stefania; Loiacono, Laura; Di Gennaro, Francesco; D039,; Offizi, Gianpiero; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Nicastri, Emanuele; Agrati, Chiara; Petrosillo, Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Girardi, Enrico; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Antinori, Andrea; Zito, Sara; Abbonizio, Maria Alessandra; Abdeddaim, Amina; Agostini, Elisabetta; Albarello, Fabrizio; Amadei, Gioia; Amendola, Alessandra; Antonica, Maria Assunta; Antonini, Mario; Bartoli, Tommaso Ascoli; Baldini, Francesco; Barbaro, Raffaella; Bartolini, Barbara; Bellagamba, Rita; Benigni, Martina; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Biava, Gianluigi; Bibas, Michele; Bordi, Licia; Bordoni, Veronica; Boumis, Evangelo; Branca, Marta; Buonomo, Rosanna; Busso, Donatella; Camici, Marta; Campioni, Paolo; Canichella, Flaminia",Int J Infect Dis,95,26

RESULTS: Of the 1000 unique patients enrolled in the EDEN trials, 70 (7%) had ARDS complicated with VAP. Mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit (ICU) stay were significantly longer in the VAP group than non-VAP group (Pâ <â .001 for both) but the 60-day mortality was comparable. Use of neuromuscular blocking agents, severe ARDS, admission for unscheduled surgery, and trauma as primary ARDS causes were independent risk factors for VAP. The area under the curve of the model was .744, and model fit was acceptable (Hosmer-Lemeshow Pâ =â .185). The calibration curve indicated that the model had proper discrimination and good calibration. DCA showed that the VAP prediction nomogram was clinically useful when an intervention was decided at a VAP probability threshold between 1% and 61%. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction nomogram for VAP development in ARDS patients can be applied after ICU admission, using available variables. Potential clinical benefits of using this model deserve further assessment.","Wu, Zongsheng; Liu, Yao; Xu, Jingyuan; Xie, Jianfeng; Zhang, Shi; Huang, Lili; Huang, Yingzi; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Haibo",Clin Infect Dis,95,20

These changes are clearly seen in mobility data, which records foot traffic using location trackers in cell phones. While mobility data is often used to extract the number of customers that visit a particular business or business type, it is the frequency and duration of concurrent occupancy at those sites that governs transmission. Understanding the way people interact at different locations can help target policies and inform contact tracing and prevention strategies. This paper outlines methods to extract interactions from mobility data and build networks that can be used in epidemiological models. Several measures of interaction are extracted: interactions between people, the cumulative interactions for a single person, and cumulative interactions that occur at particular businesses. Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders. Measures of interaction and structural trends in the resulting networks can be used to better understand potential spreading events, the percent of interactions that can be classified as close contacts, and the impact of policy choices to control transmission.","Klise, Katherine; Beyeler, Walt; Finley, Patrick; Makvandi, Monear",PLoS One,95,26

A multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) approach was utilized to analyze the cross-correlations between the Brent crude oil and agricultural futures such as London Sugar, London Wheat, USA Cotton #2, and USA Orange Juice futures. We initially confirmed their correlations by calculating the DCCA coefficient. Then, from the multifractal aspect, the cross-correlations were further explored, and the sources for forming the correlations were discussed. The results show that the Brent Crude Oil has the strongest cross-correlation with London Sugar Future market among other three agricultural future markets. Then we investigated the influence of COVID-19 on the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and agricultural futures. The experimental results indicated that the persistence under the influence of COVID-19 became stronger, and the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and sugar future market is the strongest. In addition, the cross-correlations of all the agricultural futures increased after the emergence of COVID-19 except the orange juice future market. In general, COVID-19 has a great impact on the cross-correlation of multifractal property between crude oil and most selected agricultural future markets.","Wang, Jian; Shao, Wei; Kim, Junseok",Chaos Solitons Fractals,95,16

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 senior managers across top Bombay Stock Exchange indexed organizations from the manufacturing and services sector in India during the national COVID-19 pandemic lockdown between March and June 2020. Manual content analysis and the Gioia method were used to arrive at the insights. Findings: Results of the analysis showcase the spirited immediate CSR measures undertaken by the select organizations in the broader interests of the community at large. The study also highlights the need for a paradox approach toward CSR strategy. Research limitations/implications: Given that the present study adopts an exploratory qualitative research design, the scope for generalization is rather limited. Practical implications: This paper classifies COVID-19 related initiatives undertaken by selected few top organizations in India and attempts to justify the need to opt for a paradox approach toward CSR strategy.

In this study, the microbial degradation of model (alkylated) PAHs (i.e., phenanthrene, 3-methylphenanthrene, 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene (36DMPhe), pyrene, and 1-methylpyrene (1MP)) by the bacterium Sphingobium quisquiliarum EPA505, a known degrader of PAHs, was studied. To evaluate the toxic potential of the metabolic products, reaction mixtures containing metabolites of 36DMPhe and 1MP were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their effects on the luminescence inhibition of Aliivibrio fischeri were evaluated. Although the luminescence inhibition of 36DMPhe and 1MP at their solubility levels was not observed, inhibition was observed in their metabolite fractions at the solubility limit of their parent molecule. This indicates that initial biotransformation increases the toxicity of alkylated PAHs because of the increased solubility and/or inherent toxicity of metabolites. Qualitative analysis of the metabolite fractions suggested that mono-oxidation of the methyl group is the main metabolic pathway of 36DMPhe and 1MP.","Lee, So-Young; Kwon, Jung-Hwan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),95,16

METHODS: A total of 180 patients with DOR diagnosed from December 2013 to December 2014 were equally assigned into progynova and duphaston (E+D) group, Zuogui Pill () group and BYHD group with 60 cases in each by computerized randomization. Patients received E+D, Zuogui Pill or BYHD for 12 months, respectively. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian volume, endometrial thickness, and the resistance indices (RIs) of ovarian arteries and uterine arteries were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: Nine women (4 from the E+D group, 3 from the Zuogui Pill group, and 2 from the BYHD group) withdrew from the study. After 6 months, Zuogui Pill and BYHD significantly decreased FSH and LH and increased endometrial thickness and AMH (all P<0.01). BYHD also resulted in E2 elevation (P<0.05), ovary enlargement (P<0.05), AFC increase (P<0.01), and RI of ovarian arteries decrease (P<0.05). After 12 months, further improvements were observed in the Zuogui Pill and BYHD groups (all P<0.01), but BYHD showed better outcomes, with lower FSH, larger ovaries and a thicker endometrium compared with the Zuogui Pill group (all P<0.01). However, E+D only significantly increased endometrial thickness (P<0.01) and no significant improvements were observed in the RI of uterine arteries in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: BYHD had a favorable therapeutic effect in patients with DOR by rebalancing hormone levels, promoting ovulation, and repairing the thin endometrium. The combination of tonifying Shen (Kidney), benefiting qi and activating blood circulation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for DOR.","Zhou, Jing; Pan, Xin-Yao; Lin, Jin; Zhou, Qi; Lan, Li-Kun; Zhu, Jun; Duan, Ru; Wang, Lan; Sun, Yan; Wang, Ling",Chin. j. integr. med,95,16

A total of 460 COVID-19 patients from 13 medical centers in Hubei province were investigated for their mental health status using online questionnaires (including Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, and Insomnia Severity Index scales). Among all 460 COVID-19 patients, 187 (40.65%) of them were healthcare workers (HCWs). 297 (64.57%) of them were females. The most common psychological problems were somatization symptoms (66.09%, n = 304), followed by depression (53.48%, n = 246), anxiety (46.30%, n = 213), problems of insomnia (42.01%, n = 171), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (23.26%, n = 107). Of all the patients, 15.65% (n = 72) had severe somatization symptoms, and 2.83% (n = 13) had severe (almost every day) self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts. The most common psychological problems for HCWs were somatization symptoms (67.84%, n = 125), followed by depression (51.87%, n = 97), anxiety (44.92%, n = 84), problems of insomnia (36.18%, n = 55), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (20.86%, n = 39). Patients with lower education levels were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (odds ratio [OR], 2.68, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.66-4.33 [P < 0.001]). Patients with abnormal body temperature were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (OR, 3.97, 95% CI, 2.07-7.63 [P < 0.001]), somatic symptoms (OR, 2.06, 95% CI, 1.20-3.55 [P = 0.009]) and insomnia (OR, 1.66, 95% CI, 1.04-2.65 [P = 0.033]). Those with suspected infected family members displayed a higher prevalence of anxiety than those without infected family members (OR, 1.61, 95% CI, 1.1-2.37 [P = 0.015]).

This study aimed to assess the contribution of different air pollution indicators in different spaces on the newly confirmed cases of coronavirus. According to causality's results between air pollution (AP) and COVID-19 infection in 9 countries, first, we examined the non-linear relationship from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5 as the rating variable (the cut point is 35 µg/m3) at the national level. It is concluded that the effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on COVID-19 are more sensitive in Russia, England, Germany, and France, while O3 and PM2.5 are more sensitive in America and Canada from 21 Jan to 20 May. Second, we examined the threshold effects from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 as the threshold variables, respectively, at the municipal level in China during the period 28 Jan to 31 May. It is concluded that except CO, the remaining 5 indicators are very sensitive to the increase of newly confirmed cases, and the spread of COVID-19 can be prevented and controlled by the determination of thresholds. In addition, the 9 countries and 27 provinces show that PM2.5 in high concentrations is the more sensitive pollutant on the spread of COVID-19 infection.","Liu, Qiang; Xu, Shengxia; Lu, Xiaoli",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Advances in Bayesian statistics and machine learning offer algorithm-based ways to identify good experimental designs. Adaptive design optimization (ADO; Cavagnaro, Myung, Pitt, & Kujala, 2010; Myung, Cavagnaro, & Pitt, 2013) is one such method. It works by maximizing the informativeness and efficiency of data collection, thereby improving inference. ADO is a general-purpose method for conducting adaptive experiments on the fly and can lead to rapid accumulation of information about the phenomenon of interest with the fewest number of trials. The nontrivial technical skills required to use ADO have been a barrier to its wider adoption. To increase its accessibility to experimentalists at large, we introduce an open-source Python package, ADOpy, that implements ADO for optimizing experimental design. The package, available on GitHub, is written using high-level modular-based commands such that users do not have to understand the computational details of the ADO algorithm. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial introduction to ADOpy and ADO itself, and then illustrate its use in three walk-through examples: psychometric function estimation, delay discounting, and risky choice. Simulation data are also provided to demonstrate how ADO designs compare with other designs (random, staircase).","Yang, Jaeyeong; Pitt, Mark A; Ahn, Woo-Young; Myung, Jay I",,95,14

Despite many other clinical situations, of particular interest for neurosurgery is its occurrence in cerebral vasoespam following subarachnoid hemorrhage, in temporary occlusion of intracranial vessels during neurosurgeries and, in intracranial arterial thrombosis. The cerebral lesion caused by isquemia is time-related and it can aggravated by the reperfusion of the ischemic site. Many clinical and experimental studies have been perfomed aiming the better understanding of these phenomena. This study aimed to analyse the precocious effects of focal isquemia and reperfusion uppon the brain of cats. METHODS: Focal brain ischemia was performed by temporary clipping of the middle cerebral artery for determined times followed by reperfusion during 10 minutes. The effects of isquemia were assessed through mitochondrial respiration analysis in the ischemic tissue. RESULTS: The results showed a significant decrease in O2 consumption in samples of brain tissue submitted to 60 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion when compared with not ischemic brain tissue, indicating compromising of the mitocondrial function. CONCLUSION: Based on the results we can conclude that time of ischemia was a determinant factor in the mitochondrial respiration alterations in brain tissue of cats submitted to ischemia and reperfusion of short duration (significant alterations observed only after 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion).","Nakano, Hiroshi; Oscar Colli, Benedicto; Eduardo de Salles Roselino, José",Acta cir. bras.,95,16

However, the cost-prohibitive nature of highly localized data collection and sparsity of representative signals, has made it challenging to identify neighborhood scale prevalence of disease. To overcome this challenge, we utilize alternative data sources, which are both less sparse and representative of localized disease prevalence: using query data from a large commercial search engine, we identify the prevalence of respiratory illness in the United States, localized to census tract geographic granularity. Focusing on asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we construct a set of features based on searches for symptoms, medications, and disease-related information, and use these to identify illness rates in more than 23 thousand tracts in 500 cities across the United States. Out of sample model estimates from search data alone correlate with ground truth illness rate estimates from the CDC at 0.69 to 0.76, with simple additions to these models raising those correlations to as high as 0.84. We then show that in practice search query data can be added to other relevant data such as census or land cover data to boost results, with models that incorporate all data sources correlating with ground truth data at 0.91 for asthma and 0.88 for COPD.","Abdur Rehman, Nabeel; Counts, Scott",PLoS One,95,20

Inadvertent blockade of this channel by drug-like molecules represents a key challenge in pharmaceutical R&D due to frequent overlap between the structure-activity relationships of hERG and many primary targets. Building on our previous work, together with recent cryo-EM structures of hERG, we set about to better understand the energetic and structural basis of promiscuous blocker-hERG binding in the context of Biodynamics theory. We propose a two-step blocker binding process consisting of: The initial capture step: diffusion of a single fully solvated blocker copy into a large cavity lined by the intra-cellular cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (CNBHD). Occupation of this cavity is a necessary but insufficient condition for ion current disruption.The IKr disruption step: translocation of the captured blocker along the channel axis, such that: The head group, consisting of a quasi-rod-shaped moiety, projects into the open pore, accompanied by partial de-solvation of the binding interface.One tail moiety packs along a kink between the S6 helix and proximal C-linker helix adjacent to the intra-cellular entrance of the pore, likewise accompanied by mutual de-solvation of the binding interface (noting that the association barrier is comprised largely of the total head + tail group de-solvation cost).Blockers containing a highly planar moiety that projects into a putative constriction zone within the closed channel become trapped upon closing, as do blockers terminating prior to this region.A single captured blocker copy may conceivably associate and dissociate to/from the pore many times before exiting the CNBHD cavity. Lastly, we highlight possible flaws in the current hERG safety index (SI), and propose an alternate in vivo-relevant strategy factoring in: Benefit/risk.The predicted arrhythmogenic fractional hERG occupancy (based on action potential (AP) simulations of the undiseased human ventricular cardiomyocyte).Alteration of the safety threshold due to underlying disease.Risk of exposure escalation toward the predicted arrhythmic limit due to patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic (PK) variability, drug-drug interactions, overdose, and use for off-label indications in which the hERG safety parameters may differ from their on-label counterparts.","Wan, Hongbin; Selvaggio, Gianluca; Pearlstein, Robert A",PLoS One,95,25

Vocal cord paralysis is a rare presenting symptom of hypocalcemia, especially without signs of overt tetany or seizures. Clinical case: 18 year old man with history of iron deficiency anemia and dyslipidemia presented with aphasia, right sided upper and lower extremity weakness and facial tingling for 3 days. Physical exam was notable for aphasia, pallor, positive Chvostek and Trousseau sign. Admission labs showed BUN 127 mg/dL (n 8–26 mg/dL), creatinine 12.74 mg/dL (n 0.8–2.00 mg/dL), calcium 5.2 mg/dL (n 8.5–10.5 mg/dL), magnesium (1.8–2.4 mg/dL), phosphorus 10.3 (2.4–4.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 126 (8–120 U/L), albumin 3.3 g/dL (n 3.0–5.0 g/dL), 25 OH VitD3 9.1 ng/mL (n 30–80 ng/mL), PTH 594 pg/mL (n 15–65 pg.mL), COVID 19 PCR negative. Aphasia resolved with 1 gram calcium gluconate infusion. Patient underwent emergent hemodialysis. He was placed on calcium carbonate 1500 mg oral three times daily, calcitriol 1 mcg oral twice daily, ergocalciferol 50,000 IU weekly, sevelamer carbonate 1600 mg tablet three times daily. Kidney biopsy showed membranoproliferative pattern glomerulonephritis with C3 deposits. He was discharged on hemodialysis and referred to a transplant center. Conclusion: Vocal cord paralysis is rare in adults and mostly seen in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism caused by hypomagnesaemia.2,3 Identifying vocal cord paralysis as an atypical presentation of hypocalcemia secondary to acute kidney failure requires prompt recognition and treatment.

However, information on early risk factors for the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral positivity is not yet available. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by the interval from the day of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results to the day SARS-CoV-2 testing showed negative results in these 137 patients with COVID-19. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. RESULTS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range, 4 to ~45) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger age (hazard ratio [HR], .658; P = .017); disease not being severe (HR, .653; P = .076); higher lymphocyte (HR, 1.464; P = .033), eosinophil (HR, 1.514; P = .020), and CD8+â T-cell (HR, 1.745; P = .033) counts; and lower IL-6 (HR, .664; P = .036) and IL-10 (HR, .631; P = .021). Multivariate analysis with covariable-adjusted results showed that the CD8+â T-cell count (HR, 2.376; P= .114) was a predominant risk factor for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show early laboratory parameters such as CD8+â T-cell count to be risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which has significance in the control and prevention of the disease.","Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Infect Dis,95,20

In this article we describe our experience at Richmond University Medical Center with Chembio serological IgM, IgG testing. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of patients and hospital employees, we utilized Chembio COVID-19 IgM/IgG serological testing in addition to Cepheid RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of Chembio serological test for IgM and IgG as an employee screening tool in a community hospital setting. The total number of currently asymptomatic employees screened was 1,866 from the Richmond University Medical Center. The non-exposed group included 1,253 (67.1%) employees with no significant clinical history and non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies. The convalescent group included 255 (13.7%) of the employees with elevation of IgG only, 18 (1%) employees with past history of positive PCR and COVID-19 who currently have non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies or demonstrate elevated IgG only, followed by 3 employees (< 1%) with no past clinical history who demonstrated reactive IgM and IgG antibodies and negative follow up by PCR. The reported 14.9% exposure/convalescent rate is lower than the reported 20% by the Department of Health and Governor Andrew Cuomo and may represent a better utilization of personal protective equipment, better hand washing techniques, and better disinfection procedures combined with strict social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Chembio's performance is satisfactory; however, hospitals must design their own policies addressing: who needs to be screened and who will interpret the results as well as constructing management algorithms for employees with no previous history and current double positive antibodies.","Bardarov, S; Cesare, J; Kopolovich, H; Otterbeck, P; LaBarbera, M; Nfonoyim, J; Salhany, R; Rotatori, F; Mantello, G",Clin. lab,95,22

We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO2/FIO2 ratios), and adverse events. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.93; P < 0.01; I2 = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64-4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32-6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70-1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99-1.23; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.","Lin, Ping; Zhao, Yuean; Li, Xiaoqian; Jiang, Faming; Liang, Zongan",Crit Care,95,20

The aim of this study is to reveal the preventive measures taken by renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these measures influence the prevalence of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After detecting the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, we briefed all of our renal transplant recipients on preventive measures regarding COVID-19. Two months afterward, a questionnaire was prepared regarding the preventive measures practiced by renal transplant recipients, and patients were asked whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms or had received a COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 132 patients, 68 were surveyed through telephone calls. During this time, 95.5% of patients were in isolation at home except for when seeing to their essential needs. Two (2.9%) patients were hospitalized due to increases in creatinine level and urinary tract infection. All patients have worn masks when going out and stated that they washed their hands more frequently. There was a decrease in the frequency of hospital controls in 79.4% of patients. Although 2 (2.9%) patients had complaints of dysuria and fever, they did not apply to the hospital because they thought hospitals carried risk during the pandemic. One patient had a cough with fever and was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 but tested negative. DISCUSSION: It was determined that renal transplant recipients in our study population meticulously complied with preventive measures and increased the use of masks and hand hygiene practices. As a result, none were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Hasanoglu, Imran; Bilgic, Zeynep; Olcucuoglu, Erkan; Karakan, Mine Sebnem; Demirci, Bahar Gurlek; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Guner, Rahmet",Transplant Proc,95,16

The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","Zaidi, Zareen; Razack, Saleem; Kumagai, Arno K",Perspectives on medical education,95,24

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews. RESULTS: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45. CONCLUSIONS: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.","Darcy, Alison; Daniels, Jade; Salinger, David; Wicks, Paul; Robinson, Athena",JMIR Form Res,95,22

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents (two generations from the same family) toward online learning in China during the pandemic. METHODS: A 16-item questionnaire was distributed at the 10-day and 40-day marks after the start of the first online course to 867 parent-child pairs and 141 parent-child pairs, respectively. The questionnaire was comprised of questions pertaining to course and homework completeness, effectiveness, reliability, and abundance as well as the students' enthusiasm for taking part in online classes and their satisfaction with the courses. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 90.7% (786/867) of students exhibited high or moderate enthusiasm for participating in online classes. However, most students performed poorly in online learning classes and after-school homework. With regard to satisfaction, parents' and students' average scores were 7.35 and 7.25, respectively (10-point scoring system). During the second stage of this study, parents' positive evaluations for online learning declined, including those for the effectiveness and reliability of the courses. Furthermore, the proportion of students who completed the courses and homework on time decreased; this difference proved statistically significant (P=.047). The parents' and students' overall satisfaction with online learning also declined during the second stage (parents: 7.21; students: 7.23); however, the difference in overall satisfaction between the two stages was not statistically significant (parents: P=.53; students: P=.60). Several of the parents (315/867, 36.2%) indicated that assisting with and supervising the students' online learning resulted in increased stress. Further, 36% of parents expressed dissatisfaction with or provided suggestions for online learning; most parents and students hoped to return to face-to-face classes (parents: 823/867, 94.9%; students: 811/867, 93.5%). Finally, our results presented the following six main issues that parents were the most concerned about: (1) disappointment regarding timely interaction in courses; (2) apprehensiveness about students' understanding of the course; (3) the increased burden of annoying adult responsibilities; (4) concern about children's eyesight; (5) the idea that teachers' explanations were not detailed enough; and (6) concerns about the decline of students' interest in and attention toward online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Online learning can prevent the spread of infectious diseases while still allowing elementary school students to attain knowledge. However, in our study, children's completion of the courses and homework were not satisfactory. Furthermore, their parents often experienced stress and had many concerns and complaints. Measures such as increasing the interactivity of the courses and prohibiting teachers from assigning tasks to parents could improve the effectiveness of these courses and the mental health of parents and students.","Cui, Shu; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Shijiang; Zhang, Xingong; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Ling; Yuan, Qiuyu; Huang, Cui; Cheng, Fangshuo; Zhang, Kai; Zhou, Xiaoqin",J Med Internet Res,95,25

METHODS: Single center, consecutive case series with historical controls. Patients presenting with primary RRD during the first Austrian SARS-CoV-2 lockdown (March 16th-May 3rd 2020) and a corresponding control group consisting of the same time period of the preceding 3 years. RESULTS: The mean number of patients with RD in the reference group (RG) was 22 (± 1) and in the lockdown group (LG) 15. Median total delay, defined as onset of symptoms until surgery, in the RG was 5 (lower quartile: 3.0; upper quartile: 8.0) compared to 7 (3.0; 12.0) days in the LG, (p = 0.740). During the lockdown 67% of patients were referred from an external ophthalmologist compared to 52% in the RG, (p = 0.395). 34% of patients in the RG presented with an attached macula compared to 33% in the LG (p = 0.597).

The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro. This blockade may be achieved in vivo through 'repurposing' drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics in vitro. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels. Validating our predictions, available in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry displayed this synergy. Further, analysing the data using our model, we estimated the relative usage of the two pathways and found it to vary widely across cell lines, suggesting that targeting both pathways in vivo may be important and synergistic given the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and may help improve the deployability of drug combinations targeting host proteases required for the entry.","Padmanabhan, Pranesh; Desikan, Rajat; Dixit, Narendra M",PLoS Comput Biol,95,16

Sources of information: The workgroup members used Internet search engines to retrieve documents from provincial and local hemodialysis programs; provincial public health agencies; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; webinars and slides from other kidney agencies; and nonreviewed preprints. PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed published articles. Informal input was sought from knowledge users during a webinar. Methods: Challenges in the care of hemodialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a pan-Canadian team of clinicians and administrators with expertise in hemodialysis to form the workgroup. One lead was chosen who drafted the initial document. Members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all recommendations in detail during 2 virtual meetings on April 7 and April 9. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist, an infection control expert, a community nephrologist, and a patient partner. Content was presented during an interactive webinar on April 11, 2020 attended by 269 kidney health professionals, and the webinar and first draft of the document were posted online. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 13, 2020. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: Recommendations were made under the following themes: (1) Identification of patients with COVID-19 in the dialysis unit, (2) hemodialysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19, (3) hemodialysis of patients not yet known to have COVID-19, (4) visitors; (5) testing for COVID-19 in the dialysis unit; (6) resuscitation, (6) routine hemodialysis care, (7) hemodialysis care under fixed dialysis resources. Limitations: Because of limitations of time and resources, and the large number of questions, formal systematic review was not undertaken. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and subject to bias. The parallel review process that was created may not be as robust as the standard peer review process. Implications: We hope that these recommendations provide guidance for dialysis unit directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to limit risk from infection and adverse outcomes, while providing necessary dialysis care in a setting of finite resources. We also identify a number of resource allocation priorities, which we hope will inform decisions at provincial funding agencies.","Suri, Rita S; Antonsen, John E; Banks, Cheryl A; Clark, David A; Davison, Sara N; Frenette, Charles H; Kappel, Joanne E; MacRae, Jennifer M; Mac-Way, Fabrice; Mathew, Anna; Moist, Louise M; Qirjazi, Elena; Tennankore, Karthik K; Vorster, Hans",Can J Kidney Health Dis,95,1

Design: A randomized, controlled comparison study, with crossover design was conducted. Method: Stress and caring efficacy were measured via surveys at baseline, posteducation, and again 30 to 40 days after completion of the JSJ educational intervention. Self-reported stress was the primary endpoint as measured with the validated Personal and Organizational Quality Assessment-Revised 4 Scale (POQA-R4) survey. Caring Efficacy was measured using the Coates Caring Efficacy Scale. Findings: A total of 41 nurses consented and completed the study; 18 were in the education group and 23 were in the control group. Changes in stress were sustained in the education group for the POQA-R4. Changes observed in the control group were not sustained. Statistical differences were observed when comparing education and control from baseline to final surveys for measures of emotional vitality and buoyancy. Increases in nursing caring efficacy were observed in both groups. Scores were consistently higher in the education group. Statistically significant differences were observed from baseline to final measure for the education group. Conclusions: Results show JSJ as a viable option for stress reduction in nurses.","Millspaugh, Julia; Errico, Catherine; Mortimer, Sunnie; Kowalski, Mildred Ortu; Chiu, Stephanie; Reifsnyder, Carole",J Holist Nurs,95,20

While women with hyperandrogenism experiment more symptoms in COVID-19 compared to women without hyperandrogenism, and the chronic use of an antiandrogen seemed to mitigate these symptoms, whether the benefits would be observed in overall females is unknown. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of proxalutamide as a treatment for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in females. MethodsThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel study on COVID-19 female outpatients, that compared the use of proxalutamide versus placebo. The primary outcome was hospitalization rates throughout 30 days after randomization. Patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 not hospitalized were recruited in two sites in Brasilia, Brazil, between January 4 and February 28, 2021, were randomized on a 2:3 ratio between proxalutamide and placebo, and were administered proxalutamide 200mg/day or placebo for seven days, in addition to usual care. ResultsA total of 177 women were randomized, including 75 in the proxalutamide arm and 102 patients in the placebo arm. None of the patients lost follow-up or discontinued treatment. The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.7% in the proxalutamide arm and 18.6% in the placebo arm (p<0.001), with a hospitalization risk ratio (RR) of 0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-0.59]. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that treatment of COVID-19 patients with proxalutamide in combination with standard of care was reduced hospitalization rate by 86% (p < 0.001), with no safety concerns.

However, like the episodes of biological warfare during the mid-twentieth century, the spread of these present-day conspiracy theories reflects a series of longstanding and damaging trends in the international scene which include deep mistrust, animosities, the power of ideologies such as nationalism, and the sacrifice of truth in propaganda campaigns. Also, the threats associated with biological warfare, bioterrorism, and the accidental leakage of deadly viruses from labs are real and growing.

METHODS: We designed a prospective multicenter cohort study of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to 12 Italian maternity hospitals between February 23 and March 28, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory and radiologic examinations, and pregnancy outcomes were collected. A subgroup of patients with severe disease was identified based on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, delivery for respiratory compromise, or both. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included, 14 of whom had severe disease (18%). Two thirds of the patients in the cohort were admitted during the third trimester, and 84% were symptomatic on admission. Eleven patients underwent urgent delivery for respiratory compromise (16%), and six were admitted to the ICU (8%). One woman received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no deaths occurred. Preterm delivery occurred in 12% of patients, and nine newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Patients in the severe subgroup had significantly higher pregestational body mass indexes (BMIs) and heart and respiratory rates and a greater frequency of fever or dyspnea on admission compared with women with a nonsevere disease evolution. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, one in five women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection delivered urgently for respiratory compromise or were admitted to the ICU. None, however, died.

Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study, we present QualDash, a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals. Finally, we report evaluation results that demonstrate the adaptability, ease-of-use and usefulness of QualDash in a real-world scenario.","Elshehaly, Mai; Randell, Rebecca; Brehmer, Matthew; McVey, Lynn; Alvarado, Natasha; Gale, Chris P.; Ruddle, Roy A.",,95,22

They remain a major cause of illness and death and they pose a perpetual threat of breaking out into epidemics and pandemics. Many of these respiratory viruses infect repeatedly and appear to induce only narrow transient immunity, but the situation varies from one virus to another. In the absence of effective specific treatments, understanding the role of immunity in protection, disease, and resolution is of paramount importance. These problems have been brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

However, hesitancy to vaccination is a major barrier to achieving herd immunity, particularly among a population working on a military base. To better understand the perceptions and concerns of these individuals, a voluntary survey was conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interactive, online survey was constructed and disseminated to individuals associated with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) in Dayton, OH. Survey participation was voluntary with responses collected over the initial weeks in which WPAFB began to distribute COVID-19 vaccines in a series of phases. Although initially designed to collect demographic data and identify reasons for potential vaccine hesitancy among WPAFB 88th Medical Group personnel, the study population was expanded to include all WPAFB-affiliated personnel at the direction of base leadership. The chi-squared test was used to examine the relationships between categorical variables, while multivariable logistic regression was used to assess age and occupation as independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: A total of 816 individuals completed the survey, of whom 22.7% (n = 185) self-identified as vaccine hesitant (VH). The VH group had a lower mean age than the not vaccine hesitant (NVH) group (39.3 ± 14.2 vs. 45.9 ± 13.4, P < .001). Respondents whose occupation was medical were more likely to be VH than their non-medical colleagues (49% vs. 18%, P < .001). The VH group was more concerned about short-term side effects (43% vs. 26%, P < .001), long-term side effects (82% vs. 50%, P < 0.001), vaccine effectiveness (23% vs. 5%, P < .001), vaccine making them feel sick (22% vs. 13%, P = .002), being infected with COVID-19 from the vaccine (10% vs. 5%, P = 0.008), and worry about misinformation/political agenda (43% vs. 31%, P = 0.003). Younger respondents and medical personnel were more likely to be concerned about long-term side effects and vaccine effectiveness, and the younger group was also more likely to be concerned about pregnancy/breastfeeding issues and worry about misinformation/political agenda. Age (younger vs. older, odds ratio 2.15) and occupation (medical vs. non-medical, odds ratio 3.74) were independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy. The NVH group was more likely to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to a friend or family member than the VH group (93% vs. 20%, P < .001) as were the older age group (79% vs. 67%, P = .001) and non-medical personnel (81% vs. 52%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Younger age and medical occupation were independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy and these individuals were less likely to recommend vaccination to a friend or family member. We also identified several key concerns related to vaccination hesitancy, in particular those related to short- and long-term side effects, and the spread of misinformation. Among military personnel, these findings carry important implications that may negatively impact mission readiness, a matter that merits further investigation. Our COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy findings can be used to guide targeted interventions at future vaccination campaigns in a military population.","Theis, Samuel R; Li, Peter C; Kelly, Devin; Ocampo, Thad; Berglund, Andrew; Morgan, Damien; Markert, Ronald; Fisher, Evan; Burtson, Kathryn",Mil. med,95,16

The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. We herein report six patients who developed acute stroke during COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Six patients were identified (5 men); median age was 69 years (range 57-82). Stroke subtypes were ischemic (4, 67%) and hemorrhagic (2, 33%). All patients but one had pre-existing vascular risk factors. One patient developed encephalopathy prior to stroke, characterized by focal seizures and behavioral abnormalities. COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe (i.e., requiring critical care support) in 5/6 cases (83%). Liver enzyme alteration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation were registered in all cases. Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke. Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4). CONCLUSIONS: Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection. In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor.","Morassi, Mauro; Bagatto, Daniele; Cobelli, Milena; D039,; Agostini, Serena; Gigli, Gian Luigi; Bnà, Claudio; Vogrig, Alberto",J Neurol,95,16

This article aims to develop some strategies in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of healthcare workforce and employees. METHODS: This is a prospectively registered and retrospective descriptive study investigating the clinical characteristics, results of diagnostic tests, and patients' disposition from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, at a tertiary medical center in Northern Taiwan. RESULTS: There is no nosocomial spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility. The following strategies were followed: information transparency; epidemic prevention resources planning by authorities; multidisciplinary cooperation; informative technologies; immigration quarantine policies; travel restrictions; management of diversion/subdivision; self-health monitoring; social distancing; screening of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history; traffic control bundling (TCB); training of using personal protective equipment; real-name visiting management; and employee care. The patients' basic characteristics and diagnostic results were gathered. Of the 3832 cases, about 25.9% had travel history. Most of them were traveling to Asia (419 people/time, 10.9%) and from China (256 people/time, 6.7%). Meanwhile, healthcare personnel accounted for 316 people/time (8.3%) and cleaning personnel, 6 people/time (0.16%). The 36 cases who care or have contact with confirmed cases have negative results from the COVID-19 test.

Little is known about this relationship in patients with lupus nephritis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, quantitative study. Data collected included demographics, current medication, systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, medication adherence, beliefs about medicines, shared decision-making, patient-doctor depth of relationship, patient-doctor quality of relationship, interpersonal trust in a physician and illness perceptions. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients with lupus nephritis completed the questionnaires. Logistic regression indicated that medication adherence was significantly predicted by (a) interpersonal trust in a physician (B = 0.85, Wald 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 5.44; P = 0.05); (b) timeline cyclical (B = -0.89, Wald 4.95, 95% CI 0.19, 0.90; P < 0.05) and beliefs about the necessity of medicines (B = 0.75, Wald 4.14, 95% CI 1.03, 4.38; P < 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that beliefs about the necessity of medicines significantly mediated the relationship between trust and medication adherence when adjusted for age (B = 0.48, 95% CI 0.06, 1.08; P < 0.01). A further mediation analysis showed that patient-doctor depth of relationship (B = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01, 0.09; P < 0.001), shared decision-making (B = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.13; P < 0.001) and patient-doctor quality of relationship (B = 0.08, 95% CI 0.01, 0.16; P < 0.001) significantly mediated the relationship between illness coherence and interpersonal trust in a physician. CONCLUSION: The findings highlighted two key elements: (a) the importance of trust in relation to medication adherence; and (b) a good understanding of patients' illness is linked to a better relationship with their doctor and greater participation in shared decision-making which is associated with increased trust. Tailored psycho-educational interventions could contribute to improving the patient-doctor relationship quality, trust and increased shared decision-making, which, in turn, might improve medication adherence in patients with lupus nephritis.","Georgopoulou, Sofia; Nel, Louise; Sangle, Shirish R; D039,; Cruz, David P",Lupus,95,16

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50's of 0.2-3.0 µM), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2. While dyes seemed to be promiscuous inhibitors, DRI-C23041 showed some selectivity and inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50's (6-7 µM). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.","Bojadzic, Damir; Alcazar, Oscar; Chen, Jinshui; Chuang, Sung-Ting; Condor Capcha, Jose M; Shehadeh, Lina A; Buchwald, Peter",ACS infect. dis,95,1

Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are the most common cause of AECOPD and are associated with worse clinical outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures, such as social distancing and universal masking, were originally implemented to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2; these public health measures were subsequently also observed to reduce transmission of other common circulating RVIs. In this study, we report a significant and sustained decrease in hospital admissions for all AECOPD as well as RVI-associated AECOPD, which coincided with the introduction of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Jing Yuan; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Wee, Liang En; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Thorax,95,10

Moreover, many factors remain unclear regarding the appropriate use of corticosteroids for COVID-19. In this context, this multicenter, retrospective, propensity score-matched study was launched to evaluate the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid administration for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 ranging in the degree of severity from mild to critically-ill disease. This multicenter, retrospective study enrolled consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients diagnosed January-April 2020 across 30 institutions in Japan. Clinical outcomes were compared for COVID-19 patients who received or did not receive corticosteroids, after adjusting for propensity scores. The primary endpoint was the odds ratio (OR) for improvement on a 7-point ordinal score on Day 15. Of 1092 COVID-19 patients analyzed, 118 patients were assigned to either the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid group, after propensity score matching. At baseline, most patients did not require invasive/noninvasive ventilation (85.6% corticosteroid group vs. 89.8% non-corticosteroid group). The odds of improvement in a 7-point ordinal score on Day 15 was significantly lower for the corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (OR, 0.611; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.388-0.962; p = 0.034). The time to improvement in radiological findings was significantly shorter in the corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.758; 95% CI, 1.323-2.337; p < 0.001), regardless of baseline clinical status. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was shorter in corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (HR, 1.466; 95% CI, 0.841-2.554; p = 0.177). Of the 106 patients who received methylprednisolone, the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter in the pulse/semi-pulse versus standard dose group (HR, 2.831; 95% CI, 1.347-5.950; p = 0.006). In conclusion, corticosteroids for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not improve clinical status on Day 15, but reduced the time to improvement in radiological findings for all patients regardless of disease severity and also reduced the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients who required intubation.Trial registration: This study was registered in the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry on April 21, 2020 (ID: UMIN000040211).","Ikeda, Satoshi; Misumi, Toshihiro; Izumi, Shinyu; Sakamoto, Keita; Nishimura, Naoki; Ro, Shosei; Fukunaga, Koichi; Okamori, Satoshi; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Shinkai, Masaharu; Shinoda, Masahiro; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Iijima, Yuki; Izumo, Takehiro; Inomata, Minoru; Okamoto, Masaki; Yamaguchi, Tomoyoshi; Iwabuchi, Keisuke; Masuda, Makoto; Takoi, Hiroyuki; Oyamada, Yoshitaka; Fujitani, Shigeki; Mineshita, Masamichi; Ishii, Haruyuki; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Yamaguchi, Nobuhiro; Hibino, Makoto; Tsushima, Kenji; Nagai, Tatsuya; Ishikawa, Satoru; Ishikawa, Nobuhisa; Kondoh, Yasuhiro; Yamazaki, Yoshitaka; Gocho, Kyoko; Nishizawa, Tomotaka; Tsuzuku, Akifumi; Yagi, Kazuma; Shindo, Yuichiro; Takeda, Yuriko; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Ogura, Takashi",Sci Rep,95,23

For a time-sensitive emergency such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), streamlined workflow times are essential to ensure good clinical outcomes. METHODS: The aim of this single-center, retrospective, observational study was to describe changes in stroke workflow patterns and clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from AIS patients undergoing emergent endovascular treatment (EVT) between 23 January and 8 April 2020 were retrospectively collected and compared with data from patients admitted during a similar period in 2019. The primary outcome was difference in time from symptom onset to recanalization. Secondary outcomes included workflow times, clinical management, discharge outcomes, and health-economic data. RESULTS: In all, 21 AIS patients were admitted for emergent EVT during the 77-day study period, compared with 42 cases in 2019. Median time from symptom onset to recanalization was 132 minutes longer during the pandemic compared with the previous year (672 vs. 540 min, P=0.049). Patients admitted during the pandemic had a higher likelihood of endotracheal intubation (84.6% vs. 42.4%, P<0.05) and a higher incidence of delayed extubation after EVT (69.2% vs. 45.5%, P<0.05). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at hospital discharge was similar in the 2 cohorts, whereas neurointensive care unit stay was longer in patients admitted during the pandemic (10 vs. 7 days, P=0.013) and hospitalization costs were higher (123.9 vs. 95.2 thousand Chinese Yuan, P=0.052). CONCLUSION: Disruptions to medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic has particularly impacted AIS patients undergoing emergent EVT, resulting in increased workflow times. A structured and multidisciplinary protocol should be implemented to minimize treatment delays and maximize patient outcomes.","Li, Shu; Zeng, Min; Dong, Jia; Li, Muhan; Yan, Xiang; Li, Ruowen; Zhang, Yuewei; Huo, Xiaochuan; Miao, Zhongrong; Wang, Shuo; Peng, Yuming; Han, Ruquan",J. neurosurg. anesthesiol,95,1

In areas of pandemic outbreak, the number of patients can exceed maximum capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), and, thus, these individuals often receive non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU. Effective treatments for this population are needed urgently. Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that might be beneficial in this patient population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy. We included consecutive patients (aged ≥18 years) with COVID-19, moderate-to-severe ARDS, and hyperinflammation (defined as serum C-reactive protein ≥100 mg/L, ferritin ≥900 ng/mL, or both) who were managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU and who received standard treatment of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine twice a day orally and 400 mg lopinavir with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day orally. We compared survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, changes in C-reactive protein, respiratory function, and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with anakinra (either 5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously [high dose] or 100 mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at 21 days. This study is part of the COVID-19 Biobank study, which is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04318366. FINDINGS: Between March 17 and March 27, 2020, 29 patients received high-dose intravenous anakinra, non-invasive ventilation, and standard treatment. Between March 10 and March 17, 2020, 16 patients received non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment only and comprised the comparison group for this study. A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status. At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died. In the standard treatment group, eight (50%) of 16 patients showed respiratory improvement at 21 days; one (6%) patient was on mechanical ventilation and seven (44%) died. At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0·009). Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0·15). Bacteraemia occurred in four (14%) of 29 patients receiving high-dose anakinra and two (13%) of 16 patients receiving standard treatment. Discontinuation of anakinra was not followed by inflammatory relapses. INTERPRETATION: In this retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU, treatment with high-dose anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72% of patients. Confirmation of efficacy will require controlled trials.

METHODS: In the discovery cohort, the gene expression level of 84 lncRNAs were measured in the blood of 24 adult patients including healthy controls and patients with asthma and COPD. In the replication cohort the expression of 6 selected lncRNAs were measured in 163 subjects including healthy controls and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD and children with asthma. It was evaluated whether these lncRNAs can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for any studied disease. With systems biology analysis the biological functions of the selected lncRNAs were predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the mean expression of 27 lncRNAs showed nominally significant differences in at least one comparison. OIP5-AS1, HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX, RP11-282O18.3, MZF1-AS1 were selected for measurement in the replication cohort. Three lncRNAs (HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX) expressed significantly higher in healthy children than in adult controls. All the mean expression level of the 6 lncRNAs differed significantly between adult allergic rhinitis patients and controls. RP11-325K4.3, HNRNPU and OIP5-AS1 expressed higher in allergic asthma than in non-allergic asthma. COPD and asthma differed in the expression of RP11-325K4.3 from each other. In examining of the lncRNAs as biomarkers the weighted accuracy (WA) values were especially high in the comparison of healthy controls and patients with allergic rhinitis. OIP5-AS1 and JPX achieved 0.98 and 0.9 WA values, respectively, and the combination of the selected lncRNAs also resulted in a high performance (WA = 0.98). Altogether, OIP5-AS1 had the highest discriminative power in case of three out of six comparisons. CONCLUSION: Differences were detected in the expression of circulating lncRNAs in chronic respiratory diseases. Some of these differences might be utilized as biomarkers and also suggest a possible role of these lncRNAs in the pathomechanism of these diseases. The lncRNAs and the associated pathways are potential therapeutic targets in these diseases, but naturally additional studies are needed for the confirmation of these results.","Gál, Zsófia; Gézsi, András; Semsei, Ágnes F.; Nagy, Adrienne; Sultész, Monika; Csoma, Zsuzsanna; Tamási, Lilla; Gálffy, Gabriella; Szalai, Csaba",J Transl Med,95,1

The stress and anxiety levels of respondents were also investigated. The survey obtained 1053 respondents. Additionally, environmental noise levels were measured over 24-h at two locations and compared with results before the pandemic. The results clearly exhibit that environmental noise levels and annoyance due to the noise levels dropped significantly. The annoyance drop was larger in previously noisier environments than previously tranquil locations. Noise annoyance due to neighbor noise did not change significantly; however, noise annoyance due to one's own dwelling increased. The results also confirmed an overall increase in dwelling satisfactions indicating a correlation between dwelling satisfaction and lower environmental noise levels. Although the results confirmed that noise annoyance was positively correlated with stress and anxiety levels, the change of annoyance between before and during lockdown was shown to be independent from the stress and anxiety level.","Şentop Dümen, Ayça; Şaher, Konca",J Acoust Soc Am,95,20

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether sphingosine regulates the infection of cultured and freshly isolated ex vivo human epithelial cells with pseudoviral particles expressing SARS–CoV-2 spike (pp-VSV–SARS–CoV-2 spike) that served as a bona fide system mimicking SARS–CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that exogenously applied sphingosine suspended in 0.9% NaCl prevents cellular infection with pp-SARS–CoV-2 spike. Pretreatment of cultured Vero epithelial cells or freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with low concentrations of sphingosine prevented adhesion of and infection with pp-VSV–SARS–CoV-2 spike. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sphingosine binds to ACE2, the cellular receptor of SARS–CoV-2, and prevents the interaction of the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein with ACE2. These data indicate that sphingosine prevents at least some viral infections by interfering with the interaction of the virus with its receptor. Our data also suggest that further preclinical and finally clinical examination of sphingosine is warranted for potential use as a prophylactic or early treatment for coronavirus disease-19.","Edwards, Michael J.; Becker, Katrin Anne; Gripp, Barbara; Hoffmann, Markus; Keitsch, Simone; Wilker, Barbara; Soddemann, Matthias; Gulbins, Anne; Carpinteiro, Elisa; Patel, Sameer H.; Wilson, Gregory C.; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Walter, Silke; Fassbender, Klaus; Ahmad, Syed A.; Carpinteiro, Alexander; Gulbins, Erich",J Biol Chem,95,21

Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Despite increased viral replication, pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in immunosuppressed animals. The observation that the virus was less pathogenic in these animals suggests that disease has an immunopathogenic component and shows that inflammatory responses elicited by the virus contribute to disease.","Prescott, Joseph; Falzarano, Darryl; de Wit, Emmie; Hardcastle, Kath; Feldmann, Friederike; Haddock, Elaine; Scott, Dana; Feldmann, Heinz; Munster, Vincent Jacobus",Front Immunol,95,18

To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from ten different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high‐efficiency MERV‐15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transfer of virions to locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present necessary guidance for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high‐efficiency filtration. Furthermore, the identification of SARS‐CoV‐2 in HVAC components indicates the potential utility as an indoor environmental surveillance location.","Horve, Patrick F.; Dietz, Leslie G.; Fretz, Mark; Constant, David A.; Wilkes, Andrew; Townes, John M.; Martindale, Robert G.; Messer, William B.; Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin G.",Indoor Air,95,27

In this Review, we discuss the potential threat of bioterrorism, agents that could be exploited, and recent developments in technologies and policy for detecting and controlling epidemics that have been initiated intentionally. The local and international response to infectious disease epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and west African Ebola virus epidemic, revealed serious shortcomings which bioterrorists might exploit when intentionally initiating an epidemic. Development of new vaccines and antimicrobial therapies remains a priority, including the need to expedite clinical trials using new methodologies. Better means to protect health-care workers operating in dangerous environments are also needed, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure. New and improved approaches should be developed for surveillance, early detection, response, effective isolation of patients, control of the movement of potentially infected people, and risk communication. Access to dangerous pathogens should be appropriately regulated, without reducing progress in the development of countermeasures.

We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50–60 years and ≥60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death. RESULTS: We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients.

Prediction models should be externally validated to assess their performance before implementation. This observational cohort study aimed to validate published models of severity for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using clinical and laboratory predictors. Methods: Prediction models fitting relevant inclusion criteria were chosen for validation. The outcome was either mortality or a composite outcome of mortality and ICU admission (severe disease). 1295 patients admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 at Kings Cross Hospital (KCH) in London, United Kingdom, and 307 patients at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) in Oslo, Norway were included. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. Results: We identified two models for prediction of mortality (referred to as Xie and Zhang1) and two models for prediction of severe disease (Allenbach and Zhang2). The performance of the models was variable. For prediction of mortality Xie had good discrimination at OUH with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.87 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.95] and acceptable discrimination at KCH, AUROC 0.79 [0.76-0.82].

These methods have had a positive impact in the field of virology and helped to further our knowledge of how viruses invade cells. Nearly all positive-strand RNA viruses propagate their viral genomes in part through intracellular membranes. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, accumulates viral RNA that forms replication complexes (RCs) in infected cells. In this study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), we dissected PRRSV-induced membrane structures in infected cells and determined the correlations between PRRSV particles and vesicles stimulated by PRRSV to understand the structural and dynamic aspects of PRRSV infection. METHODS: We identified the appropriate time point by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The co-localization of viruses and organelles was determined by immunofluorescence and immune-electron microscopy (IEM). The ultrastructure of cells infected by PRRSV was observed using EM and electron tomography (ET). RESULTS: In our study, we found that PRRSV dsRNA was located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagosomes; in addition, the N protein was located at the mitochondria, ER and autophagosomes. Vesicles induced by PRRSV appeared at 16 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) and increased in size with time during the infection period. In addition, our findings demonstrated that the virus vesicles originated from the ER, and these two organelle structures connected with each other to form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) that provided a site for virus replication and assembly. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that membrane vesicles induced by PRRSV were derived from the ER. The vesicles may provide a location for PRRSV replication and assembly.","Zhang, Wei; Chen, Keren; Zhang, Xueqing; Guo, Chunhe; Chen, Yaosheng; Liu, Xiaohong",PLoS One,95,19

The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that the N protein’s central disordered domain drives phase separation with RNA, and that phosphorylation of an adjacent serine/arginine rich region modulates the physical properties of the resulting condensates. In cells, N forms condensates that recruit the stress granule protein G3BP1, highlighting a potential role for N in G3BP1 sequestration and stress granule inhibition. The SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein independently induces N protein phase separation, and three-component mixtures of N + M + RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N + M or N + RNA, including annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N + RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contributes both to suppression of the G3BP1-dependent host immune response and to packaging genomic RNA during virion assembly.","Lu, Shan; Ye, Qiaozhen; Singh, Digvijay; Cao, Yong; Diedrich, Jolene K.; Yates, John R.; Villa, Elizabeth; Cleveland, Don W.; Corbett, Kevin D.",Nat Commun,95,20

The diversity of this virus has been verified by sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, but this method must be supplemented with further analysis for characterization of the agent. To increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this virus, we investigated the response of chickens to 2 IBV with different genotypes, KIIa and ChVI. The clinical signs induced by the viruses were observed. In addition, the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α factor and the serum levels of α1-acid glycoprotein, which is a major acute phase protein, were measured. The KIIa genotype (Kr/ADL110002/2011) induced clinical signs accompanied by the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a higher viral load. In chickens infected with this isolate, simultaneous peaks in the viral copy number and cytokine production were observed at 7 dpi in the trachea and 9 d postinoculation in the kidney. On the other hand, the chickens infected with the ChVI genotype (Kr/ADL120003/2012) did not show a response other than a mild upregulation of cytokines at 1 d postinoculation, which appears to indicate the invasion of the virus. In summary, we confirmed a differential innate response following infection with distinct IBV. We hypothesize that an excessive innate response contributes to the scale of the pathophysiologic effect in chickens.","Jang, Hyesun; Koo, Bon-Sang; Jeon, Eun-Ok; Lee, Hae-Rim; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Mo, In-Pil",Poultry Science,95,30

Different lung cell populations have been suggested as culprits in the unregulated innate immune responses observed in these cases. This study aims to clarify this question by studying the different induction of innate immune molecules by the distinct lung anatomic compartments (vascular, alveolar and bronchiolar) of ferrets intratracheally infected with a human pH1N1 viral isolate, by means of laser microdissection techniques. The obtained results were then analysed in relation to viral quantification in the different anatomic areas and the histopathological lesions observed. More severe lung lesions were observed at 24 h post infection (hpi) correlating with viral antigen detection in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells. However, high levels of viral RNA were detected in all anatomic compartments throughout infection. Bronchiolar areas were the first source of IFN-α and most pro-inflammatory cytokines, through the activation of RIG-I.

Assessing the associations between human behavior, infection, and social measures is essential to understand achievable reductions in cases and identify the factors driving changes in social dynamics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nighttime population volumes, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the implementation of public health and social measures in Tokyo. METHODS: We used mobile phone location data to estimate populations between 10 PM and midnight in seven Tokyo metropolitan areas. Mobile phone trajectories were used to distinguish and extract on-site dining from stay-at-work and stay-at-home behaviors. Numbers of new cases and symptom onsets were obtained. Weekly mobility and infection data from March 1 to November 14, 2020, were analyzed using a vector autoregression model. RESULTS: An increase in the number of symptom onsets was observed 1 week after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=0.60, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). The effective reproduction number significantly increased 3 weeks after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=1.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.89). The nighttime population volume increased significantly following reports of decreasing numbers of confirmed cases (coefficient=–0.44, 95% CI –0.73 to –0.15). Implementation of social measures to restaurants and bars was not significantly associated with nighttime population volume (coefficient=0.004, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The nighttime population started to increase after decreasing incidence of COVID-19 was announced. Considering time lags between infection and behavior changes, social measures should be planned in advance of the surge of an epidemic, sufficiently informed by mobility data.","Nakanishi, Miharu; Shibasaki, Ryosuke; Yamasaki, Syudo; Miyazawa, Satoshi; Usami, Satoshi; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Nishida, Atsushi",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,95,1

Previous studies that solely applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models were subject to underfitting or overfitting problems. We propose a new model named Dynamic-Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Quarantined (D-SEIQ), by making appropriate modifications of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model and integrating machine learning based parameter optimization under epidemiological rational constraints. We used the model to predict the long-term reported cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in China from January 27, 2020. We evaluated our model on officially reported confirmed cases from three different regions in China, and the results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of simulating and predicting the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. In China-Excluding-Hubei area within 7 days after the first public report, our model successfully and accurately predicted the long trend up to 40 days and the exact date of the outbreak peak. The predicted cumulative number (12,506) by March 10, 2020, was only 3·8% different from the actual number (13,005). The parameters obtained by our model proved the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies on epidemic control in China. The prediction results for five other countries suggested the external validity of our model. The integrated approach of epidemic and machine learning models could accurately forecast the long-term trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model parameters also provided insights into the analysis of COVID-19 transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in China.","Sun, Jichao; Chen, Xi; Zhang, Ziheng; Lai, Shengzhang; Zhao, Bo; Liu, Hualuo; Wang, Shuojia; Huan, Wenjing; Zhao, Ruihui; Ng, Man Tat Alexander; Zheng, Yefeng",Sci Rep,95,28

METHODS: First, best practices in translation and cross-cultural adaptation were applied through 6 steps. Then, the Spanish version was delivered to CR participants from programs in Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru for validation, such that the evaluation was pre-post, uncontrolled, pragmatic, observational, and prospective in design. Participants completed surveys assessing knowledge, health literacy, self-efficacy, and health behaviours. All outcomes were assessed pre-, and post-CR, as well as 6 months after CR completion. RESULTS: After translation of the patient guide from English to Spanish, 5 of the 9 booklets were culturally adapted. Two-hundred and forty-nine patients consented to participate, of which 184 (74%) completed post-CR, and 121 (48%) completed final assessments. There was a significant improvement in disease-related knowledge pre- to post-CR, as well as in health literacy, self-efficacy, and health behaviours (all p < 0.05). These gains were sustained 6 months post-program. With adjustment, CR attendance (i.e., exposure to the education) was associated with greater post-CR knowledge (ß = 0.026; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: A patient education intervention for CR patients in Latin America has been validated, and wider implementation is warranted. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Application of this first-ever validated CR education program for Spanish-speaking settings may result in secondary prevention.","de Melo Ghisi, Gabriela Lima; Grace, Sherry L.; Anchique, Claudia V; Gordillo, Ximena; Fernandez, Rosalía; Quesada, Daniel; Loaiciga, Blanca Arrieta; Reyes, Patricia; Chaparro, Elena; Meza, Renzo Soca; Coronado, Julia Fernandez; Ñahui, Marco Heredia; Vilchez, Rocio Palomino; Oh, Paul",Patient Educ Couns,95,32

This article reviewed the literature on IBRs, focussing on past policies and interventions, general characteristics, infrastructure and service access to inform an analysis of potential health risks from the existing literature to guide future research and policy-making. Research followed a qualitative approach to review IBR literature dating after 2004. Relevant publications were identified from bibliographic databases using Boolean search logic and by reviewing citations in and later citations of these publications. Relevant secondary sources were also included. The review evidenced that IBRs have received increasing policy, but limited research attention, and that health hazards have been particularly neglected. Although issues such as shared water and sanitation, inappropriate waste disposal, poor hygiene practices, high densities and poor quality structures have been referenced extensively – alluding to risks and health concerns – few studies have focussed directly on health, risk and vulnerability. The risk analysis completed based on the literature made potential risks explicit, exemplified by references to specific conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and the coronavirus pandemic, demonstrating pathogenic pathways, contamination and transmission risks conducive to poor health, infection and potential disaster. The review captured and updated the contemporary literature on IBRs, with the subsequent analysis providing a platform for future empirical research on health, infrastructure and IBRs to address potential risks towards positive change in future policies.","Lategan, Louis G.; Erasmus, Shayne; Zietsman, Markus; Cilliers, Elizelle J.; Wolf, Mario; Springer, Christian A.",Jamba,95,25

The relationships between the OI3 and mechanical ventilation (MV) and death were analyzed. Results: Patients with COVID-19 exhibited low O3I (mean: 4.15%; range: 3.06–6.14%)—consistent with insufficient fish and Omega-3 supplement consumption, and markedly lower than the healthy control subjects (mean: 7.84%; range: 4.65–10.71%).

We aimed to report ceiling of care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) decisions and their association with demographic and clinical characteristics as well as outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between 5th March and 7th May 2020 of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Ceiling of care and CPR decisions were documented using the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) process. Unadjusted and multivariable regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with ceiling of care decisions and death during hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients were included, of whom 409 (84·3%) had a documented ceiling of care; level one for 208 (50·9%), level two for 75 (18·3%) and level three for 126 (30·8%). CPR decisions were documented for 451 (93·0%) of whom 336 (74·5%) were ‘not for resuscitation’. Advanced age, frailty, White-European ethnicity, a diagnosis of any co-morbidity and receipt of cardiovascular medications were associated with ceiling of care decisions. In a multivariable model only advanced age (odds 0·89, 0·86–0·93 p < 0·001), frailty (odds 0·48, 0·38–0·60, p < 0·001) and the cumulative number of co-morbidities (odds 0·72, 0·52–1·0, p = 0·048) were independently associated. Death during hospitalisation was independently associated with age, frailty and requirement for level two or three care. CONCLUSION: Ceiling of care decisions were made for the majority of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, broadly in line with known predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19, but with a focus on co-morbidities suggesting ICU admission might not be a reliable end-point for observational studies where advanced care planning is routine.","Straw, Sam; McGinlay, Melanie; Drozd, Michael; Slater, Thomas A.; Cowley, Alice; Kamalathasan, Stephe; Maxwell, Nicholas; Bird, Rory A.; Koshy, Aaron O.; Prica, Milos; Patel, Peysh A.; Relton, Samuel D.; Gierula, John; Cubbon, Richard M.; Kearney, Mark T.; Witte, Klaus K.",BMC Palliat Care,95,21

METHODS: A total of 20 pathogens, including viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were detected using molecular sensitive assays, and their associations with the patient’s demographic data and season were analyzed. RESULTS: Viral infectious agents were found in 449 (87.2%) of 515 specimens. Dual and multiple infectious agents were detected in 31.4% and 18.6% of the samples, respectively. Viral infection was predominant in the pediatric environment (90.8%, P < 0.001), male patients (88.0%), and spring (93.8%).

This disease predominantly affects the organs of the respiratory system, but it also damages the brain, liver, kidneys and especially the heart. In the heart, scientific evidence shows that this virus can damage the coronary arteries, generating microvascular dysfunction, favoring acute myocardial infarction. Furthermore, with the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it can lead to myocarditis and cardiac fibrosis, inducing changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart, generating cardiac arrhythmias. All these factors mentioned are protagonists in promoting the increase in the mortality outcome. This outcome may be even higher if the individuals are elderly, or if they have other diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension, because they may already have cardiomyopathy.

Our study looks to observe if there has been an effect on the quality of colonoscopies, as indicated by quality measures such as cecal intubation rate (CIR), cecal intubation time (CIT), scope withdrawal time (SWT) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with the adoption of standard COVID-19 precautions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening colonoscopies. The study utilized data on CIR, CIT, SWT and ADR from outpatient, non-emergent procedures conducted at 3 endoscopy suites of St Lukes University Health Network. All inpatient and emergent procedures were excluded. Data was obtained by performing chart review on EPIC electronic health record. Results: Our study demonstrated that the total number of screening colonoscopies was decreased between 2019 to 2020 (318 in 2019 vs 157 in 2020, p= 0.005). CIT (320+/-105 seconds in 2019 vs 392+/-107 seconds in 2020, p=0.001) and SWT (706+/-232 seconds in 2019 vs 830+/-241 seconds in 2020, p=0.001) were increased while CIR (98.2% in 2019 vs 96.6% in 2020, p=0.04) was decreased between 2019 and 2020 likely due to PPE introduction. ADR was similar between the two groups (38.23 (12.50-66.66) in 2019 vs 38.18(16.66-66.00) in 2020, p=0.8). Conclusion: Our study showed that quality indices for screening colonoscopies like cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation time and scope withdrawal time were negatively impacted during the initial COVID time period compared to pre-COVID time. The study also displayed that though there was a significant decline in both screening and diagnostic colonoscopies during pandemic, adenoma detection rates were comparable. Thus, the efficiency of the procedures was affected by the use of PPE but it did not affect the colonoscopies clinical benefits.","Chirayath, S.

To facilitate the rapid discovery of inhibitors with clinical potential, we have applied ligand- and structure-based computational approaches to develop a virtual screening methodology that allows us to predict potential inhibitors. In this work, virtual screening was performed against two natural products databases, Super Natural II and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additionally, we have used an integrated drug repurposing approach to computationally identify potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 in databases of drugs (both approved and withdrawn). Roughly 360,000 compounds were screened using various molecular fingerprints and molecular docking methods; of these, 80 docked compounds were evaluated in detail, and the 12 best hits from four datasets were further inspected via molecular dynamics simulations.

Our study aimed to investigate the immediate psychological consequences of the pandemic on Italian parents and children focusing on internalizing and post-traumatic symptoms. We also wanted to explore the impact of possible risk and resilience factors, e.g., lifestyle and behaviors, emotional and cognitive beliefs, on parents and children’s reaction to the emergency distress. An online survey was administered during the country’s nationwide lockdown to 721 Italian parents of at least one child aged between 6 and 18 years. The respondent completed the survey for himself/herself and his/her child. The survey included socio-demographic items and validated questionnaires on parents’ post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, and on children’s internalizing problems. Parents were asked to fill the questionnaires twice: once referring to the current emergency condition and once recalling how they and their child felt a few months before Covid-19 outbreak. Multiple regression analyses showed that specific demographic characteristics (i.e., sex and age) and psychological factors of children and parents, such as fear of contagion and the opportunity to think about possible secondary positive effects of the pandemic, had a predictive value on the presence of internalizing symptoms of both parents and children. Moreover, parents’ behaviors during the lockdown period (i.e., employment status and sport practiced) were significantly related to their own internalizing symptoms; these symptoms, in turn, had a strong and positive predictive value on children’s internalizing problems. Besides, analyses of variance showed that internalizing symptoms of parents and children were significantly higher during the Covid-19 pandemic than before it started. In addition to showing a direct effect of the pandemic on the psychological health of parents and children, the present results also give a series of important information on how parents perceive, and therefore influence, their children in this period of emergency. Our findings thus highlight the urgent need to provide parents with adequate support to take care of their own psychological wellbeing and to help their children coping with the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic.","Crescentini, Cristiano; Feruglio, Susanna; Matiz, Alessio; Paschetto, Andrea; Vidal, Enrico; Cogo, Paola; Fabbro, Franco",Front Psychol,95,1

It was recently reported that, in addition to the intrathymic T-cell differentiation pathway, an extrathymic differentiation pathway of alpha beta-T-cell receptor (TCR) T lymphocytes exists in the liver, and becomes important under pathological situations such as autoimmune diseases, malignancies or hepatic bacterial infections. In the present study, we compared the phenotypes of resident hepatic, splenic or thymic T-cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by HMV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. The number of liver-resident mononuclear cells (MNC) increased during the viral infection, while cellularity decreased. Single positive (SP) CD4+ cells strongly increased in both the liver and thymus, while double positive (DP) (CD4+ CD8+) cells, present in the liver and thymus of mock-infected mice, decreased in C57BL/6 mice during the viral infection. A shift of alpha beta-TCRintermediate T cells toward alpha beta-TCRhigh was evidenced in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in the spleen. The few alpha beta-TCRint double negative (DN) (CD4-CD8-) cells also decreased following viral infection. alpha beta-TCRint or high lymphocytes expressing high levels of leucocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) increased in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. In addition, liver-resident T cells expressed strongly the CD44 (Pgp-1) activation marker, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen experienced during the viral infection. No significant change in T-cell subpopulations was detected in the spleen, suggesting that MHV3 infection could induce an early in situ differentiation of resident hepatic T cells rather than a recruitment of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid organs.","Lamontagne, L; Massicotte, E; Page, C",Immunology,95,10

In this study, we aim to clarify the frequency of false-positive reactions and reveal their details in SARS-CoV-2 quantitative antigen test using an automated laboratory device. Methods Nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=4,992) and saliva samples (n=5,430) were collected. We measured their SARS-CoV-2 antigen using Lumipulse® Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and performed a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using the AmpdirectTM 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit as needed. The results obtained from each detection test were compared accordingly. Results There were 304 nasopharyngeal samples and 114 saliva samples were positive in the Lumipulse® Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag test. All positive nasopharyngeal samples in the antigen test were also positive for NAAT. In contrast, only three (2.6%) of all the positive saliva samples in the antigen test were negative for NAAT. One showed no linearity with a dilute solution in the dilution test. Additionally, the quantitative antigen levels of all the three samples did not decrease after reaction with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Conclusions The judgment difference between the quantitative antigen test and NAAT seemed to be caused by non-specific reactions in the antigen test. Although the high positive and negative predictive value of this quantitative antigen test could be confirmed, we should consider the possibility of false-positives caused by non-specific reactions and understand the characteristics of antigen testing. We recommend that repeating centrifugation before measurement, especially in saliva samples, should be performed appropriately.","Kobayashi, Ryo; Murai, Ryosei; Moriai, Mikako; Nirasawa, Shinya; Yonezawa, Hitoshi; Kondoh, Takashi; Saeki, Masachika; Yakuwa, Yuki; Sato, Yuki; Katayama, Yuki; Nakafuri, Hirotaka; Kitayama, Ikumi; Asanuma, Koichi; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Satoshi",J Infect Chemother,95,9

The aim of this prospective birth cohort study was to identify risk factors for an hMPV or RSV infection during the first year of life in unselected healthy children. We followed 217 children from birth to 1 year of age. Nasal swabs and symptom diaries were collected monthly. Anti-hMPV and anti-RSV IgG antibodies by age 1 year were detected by ELISA, and nasal swabs were analysed for hMPV and RSV by RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis. Anti-hMPV IgG was found in 38 children (17.5%), and anti-RSV IgG in 172 children (79%). Risk factors for being anti-hMPV IgG-positive were: (1) being born in the spring (OR = 2.36; 95% CI:1.06–5.27), and (2) having older siblings (OR = 3.82; 95% CI:1.75–8.34). Risk factors for being anti-RSV IgG-positive were: (1) gestational age <38 weeks (OR = 3.39; 95% CI:1.42–8.05), (2) increasing paternal age (OR = 1.85 per 5 yrs; 95% CI:1.28–2.68), and (3) wall-to-wall carpeting (OR = 3.15; 95% CI:1.29–7.68). Being born in the spring was associated with decreased odds of being anti-RSV IgG-positive (OR = 0.27, 95% CI:0.09–0.85). Risk factors for RSV hospitalisation (n = 11) were: (1) older siblings (OR = 4.49; 95% CI: 1.08–18.73) and (2) smoking in the household (OR = 5.06; 95% CI: 1.36–18.76). Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 14 days of life protected against hospitalisation (OR = 0.21; 95% CI:0.06–0.79).

The lung is usually poorly explorable, but it provides more acoustic information in pathological conditions that modify the relationship between air, water and tissues. The different acoustic impedance of all these components makes the chest wall a powerful ultrasound reflector: this is responsible for the creation of several artifacts providing valuable information about lung pathophysiology.

This review aimed to scope current scientific literature on mTechs in CR to assess the impact on patients’ exercise capacity and to identify gaps and future directions for research. PubMed, CENTRAL, and CDSR were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs had to utilize mTechs to objectively monitor and promote PA of patients during or following CR, aim at improvements in exercise capacity, and be published between December 2014 and December 2019. A total of 964 publications were identified, and 13 studies met all inclusion criteria. Home-based CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs and outpatient CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs did not lead to statistically significant differences in exercise capacity. In contrast, outpatient CR followed by home-based CR with mTechs led to significant improvement in exercise capacity as compared to outpatient CR without further formal CR. Supplying patients with mTechs may improve exercise capacity. To ensure that usage of and compliance with mTechs is optimal, a concentrated effort of CR staff has to be achieved. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented lack of patient support while away from institutional CR.

We calibrate the model and match it to the data from the United States. The model predicts the epidemic in the United States very well. Without government intervention, our simulation shows that the epidemic peaks on 22 March, 2020 and ends on 29 August, 2022. By the end of the epidemic, more than 21 million people will be infected, and the death toll is close to 3.8 million. We further conduct counterfactual experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different polices against the virus. We find that no single policy can effectively suppress the epidemic, and the most effective policy is a hybrid policy with lockdown and broadening testing. Lockdown policy alone is ineffective in controlling the epidemic as agents would have optimally stayed at home anyway if the infection risk is high even without a lockdown. Broadening testing solely will accelerate the return to normal life as there are fewer infected people hanging around. However, as people do not internalize the social costs of returning to normal life, the epidemic could get even worse. Increasing medical capacity without any other measures only has temporary effects on reducing the death toll. We also find that random testing is too inefficient unless a majority of population is infected.","Ng, Wung Lik",J Macroecon,95,3

COVID-19 causative agent is structurally and genetically similar to SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The drastic increase in the number of coronavirus and its genome sequence have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform bioinformatics and genomics analysis on this class of viruses. Clinical tests like PCR and ELISA for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. However, these techniques are expensive and not readily available for point-of-care (POC) applications. Currently, lack of any rapid, available, and reliable POC detection method gives rise to the progression of COVID-19 as a horrible global problem. To solve the negative features of clinical investigation, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of coronaviruses and describe various amplification assays, sensing, biosensing, immunosensing, and aptasensing for the determination of various groups of coronaviruses applied as a template for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. All sensing and biosensing techniques developed for the determination of various classes of coronaviruses are useful to recognize the newly immerged coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. Also, the introduction of sensing and biosensing methods sheds light on the way of designing a proper screening system to detect the virus at the early stage of infection to tranquilize the speed and vastity of spreading. Among other approaches investigated among molecular approaches and PCR or recognition of viral diseases, LAMP-based methods and LFAs are of great importance for their numerous benefits, which can be helpful to design a universal platform for detection of future emerging pathogenic viruses.

SELENOP is unique among selenoproteins, as it contains multiple genetically encoded SeCys residues, whereas all the other characterized selenoproteins contain just one. SELENOP occurs in the form of multiple isoforms, truncated species and post-translationally modified variants which are relatively poorly characterized. The accurate quantification of SELENOP is contingent on the availability of specific primary standards and reference methods. Before recombinant SELENOP becomes available to be used as a primary standard, careful investigation of the characteristics of the SELENOP measured by electrospray MS and strict control of the recoveries at the various steps of the analytical procedures are strongly recommended. This review critically discusses the state-of-the-art of analytical approaches to the characterization and quantification of SELENOP. While immunoassays remain the standard for the determination of human and animal health status, because of their speed and simplicity, mass spectrometry techniques offer many attractive and complementary features that are highlighted and critically evaluated.","Lamarche, Jérémy; Ronga, Luisa; Szpunar, Joanna; Lobinski, Ryszard",Int J Mol Sci,95,1

The first studies investigated plant melatonin from a human perspective quantifying melatonin in foods and medicinal plants and questioning whether its presence could explain the activity of some plants as medicines. Starting with these first handful of studies in the late 1990s, plant melatonin research has blossomed into a vibrant and active area of investigation and melatonin has been found to play critical roles in mediating plant responses and development at every stage of the plant life cycle from pollen and embryo development through seed germination, vegetative growth and stress response. Here we have utilized a systematic approach in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocols to reduce bias in our assessment of the literature and provide an overview of the current state of melatonin research in plants, covering 1995–2021. This review provides an overview of the biosynthesis and metabolism of melatonin as well as identifying key themes including: abiotic stress responses, root development, light responses, interkingdom communication, phytohormone and plant signaling. Additionally, potential biases in the literature are investigated and a birefringence in the literature between researchers from plant and medical based which has helped to shape the current state of melatonin research. Several exciting new opportunities for future areas of melatonin research are also identified including investigation of non-crop and non-medicinal species as well as characterization of melatonin signaling networks in plants.","Murch, Susan J.; Erland, Lauren A.

Stress granules (SGs), which are assembled during viral infection and function to sequester host and viral mRNAs and proteins, are part of the antiviral responses. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)protein, an RNA binding protein essential for viral production, interacted with Ras-GTPase-Activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein (G3BP) and disrupted SG assembly, both of which require intrinsically disordered region1 (IDR1) in N protein. The N protein partitioned into SGs through liquid-liquid phase separation with G3BP, and blocked the interaction of G3BP1 with other SG-related proteins. Moreover, the N protein domains important for phase separation with G3BP and SG disassembly were required for SARS-CoV-2 viral production. We propose that N protein-mediated SG disassembly is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 production.","Luo, Lingling; Li, Zhean; Zhao, Tiejun; Ju, Xiaohui; Ma, Peixiang; Jin, Boxing; Zhou, Yulin; He, Su; Huang, Jinhua; Xu, Xun; Zou, Yan; Li, Ping; Liang, Aibin; Liu, Jia; Chi, Tian; Huang, Xingxu; Ding, Qiang; Jin, Zhigang; Huang, Cheng; Zhang, Yu",Sci Bull (Beijing),95,1

There exist no cure or vaccine for COVID-19. Classic public health approaches such as hygiene and sanitation, and social distancing are the recommended measures to contain the spread of the causative virus. While it is possible to combine strict lockdown measures in some western countries, this is not practical in almost every country in sub-Saharan Africa. In Cameroon, those without symptoms are encouraged to respect measures of hygiene and sanitation, physical distancing, and to wear a mask in public places. Those who develop symptoms are isolated in accredited COVID-19 management centres until they recover. However, the latter strategy is ineffective in containing the local spread of the virus because testing is not robust. Intuitively, the control of the virus in Cameroon depends largely on how engaged the public is in fighting against the virus. Social media can complement the use of community health workers for community or public engagement. In this viewpoint, we discuss how to optimize public engagement, to combat misinformation and to develop a culture for preparedness amidst the COVID-19 pandemic when time and resources are of the essence.","Agbor, Valirie Ndip; Simo, Larissa Pone; Epie, Terrence Beteck",Pan Afr Med J,95,24

Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of Münster (UHM). METHODS: Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Threshold cycle (C(t)) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results. C(t) values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007). CONCLUSION: Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM. Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","Schwierzeck, Vera; König, Jens Christian; Kühn, Joachim; Mellmann, Alexander; Correa-Martínez, Carlos Luis; Omran, Heymut; Konrad, Martin; Kaiser, Thomas; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Clin Infect Dis,95,6

This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity. To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities’ prescription, its former benchmarks. This paper supports and comments Anses’ Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases. Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.","Margaritis, Irène; Houdart, Sabine; El Ouadrhiri, Youssef; Bigard, Xavier; Vuillemin, Anne; Duché, Pascale",Arch Public Health,95,14

My analysis underscores the use of constitutive and stigmatizing rhetoric to depict individual bodies, rather than environments, as prime sources of infection. Common among workplaces, this rhetoric provides the impetus for encouraging individual behavior change as a hedge against infection risk.

SARS-COVID19 represents a health threat nowadays. Peri-operative SARS-COVID19 infection after esophagectomy might negatively affect the postoperative outcomes. The use of tocilizumab as an alternative to reduce the inflammatory response in SARS-COVID19 is an option that has not been described in the literature after esophagectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A SARS-COVID19-vaccinated (CORONAVAC) 73-year-old man with pulmonary emphysema, coronary artery disease, previous asymptomatic pulmonary embolism, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction tumor was submitted to laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy (ypT2N0M0) after perioperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He was also infected with SARS-COVID19, confirmed by PCR test at the 14th postoperative day. During follow-up, mild hypoxemia persisted without evidence of infection except for SARS-COVID19, and a high-flow cannula was required to maintain oxygenation. Tocilizumab was administered following high parameters of a high-flow cannula, and invasive mechanical ventilation was avoided. DISCUSSION: Besides of the risk of secondary infection, after administration of tocilizumab, the parameters of oxygen supplementation were systematically reduced, and he stayed in the ICU for seven days. He was discharged from the ward six days later. He developed late cervical anastomotic leakage, which was treated with conservative therapy. CONCLUSION: Although the patient had high-risk comorbidities, esophagectomy, and SARS-COVID19 infection, the use of tocilizumab was safe and improved the pulmonary recovery.","Takeda, Flavio Roberto; Muniz, Renan Rosetti; Fonseca, Silvia Moulin Ribeiro; de Matos Soeiro, Alexandre; de Castro de Abreu, Barbara Seffair; Litvoc, Marcelo Nóbrega",Int J Surg Case Rep,95,5

METHODS: A retrospective review identified 832 patients — 631 inpatients and 201 outpatients—with diabetes and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between March 1 and June 15, 2020. Comparisons between the outpatient and inpatient cohorts was conducted to identify risk factors associated with severity of disease determined by admission rate and mortality. Previous DPP-4 inhibitor use and disease outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Risk factors for increased admission included older age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.01 – 1.06), p = 0.003) presence of chronic kidney disease (OR 2.32 (1.26 – 4.28), p = 0.007), and a higher A1C at time of admission (OR 1.25 (1.12 – 1.39), p <0.001).

Various existing basic or advanced life support (BLS or ALS, respectively) rules for the termination of resuscitation (TOR) have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID-19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18–March 31, 2020. The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value (FPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of each TOR rule were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated. TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation (BLS-TOR) rule, which showed 85% specificity, 74% sensitivity, 0.8% FPV, and 99% PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes. When the traditional BLS-TOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge. With regard to the FPV (upper limit of 95% confidence interval < 5%), specificity (100%), and PPV (> 99%) criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rules. CONCLUSION: Among the previous nine BLS and ALS TOR rules, KoCARC TOR rule I was most suitable for predicting poor survival outcomes and showed improved diagnostic performance. Further research on variations in resources and treatment protocols among facilities, regions, and cultures will be useful in determining the feasibility of TOR rules for COVID-19 patients worldwide.

Gender differences in the perception of signs and symptoms of minor illness were examined on data from the MRC Common Cold Unit. Volunteers assessed the presence and severity of colds at the end of their stay in the Unit, using the same two measures as a trained clinical observer (all ratings were double blind). Even after adjustment for other variables, men were significantly more likely to ‘over-rate’ their symptoms in comparison with the clinical observer than were women. These data, and recent analyses from elsewhere, suggest that rather than artefactually exaggerating gender differences in morbidity, differing thresholds for perceiving and reporting symptoms may produce underestimates of gender differences in morbidity.","Macintyre, Sally",Social Science & Medicine,95,28

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that elicit immunomodulatory effects and had shown in vitro antiviral effects against SRAS-CoV-2. This drug divided opinion worldwide in the medical community but also in the press, the general public and in public health policies. The aim of this systematic review and this meta-analysis was to bring a new overview on this controversial drug and to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could reduce COVID-19 mortality risk in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and grey literature were searched until 10 June 2020. Only studies of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) compared with a comparative standard care group and with full-text articles in English were included. Studies reporting effect sizes as Odds Ratios, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk for mortality risk and the number of deaths per groups were included. This meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020190801). Independent extraction has been performed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. The initial search leaded to 112 articles, from which 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. 15 studies were retained for association between hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 survival including 15,081 patients (8,072 patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 7,009 patients in the standard care arm with respectively, 1,578 deaths and 1,423 deaths). 6 studies were retained for hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality risk (pooled Relative Risk RR=0.82 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-1.07, I2=82, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=15)) within hospitalized patients, nor in association with azithromycin (pooled Relative Risk RR=1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.92, I2=75%, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=6)), nor in the numerous subgroup analysis by study design, median age population, published studies (vs unpublished articles), level of bias risk. However, stratified analysis by continents, we found a significant decreased risk of mortality associated with hydroxychlroquine alone but not with azithromycin among European (RR= 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41-0.93, n=7)) and Asian studies (RR=0.36 (95%CI:0.18-0.73, n=1)), with heterogeneity detected across continent (Pheterogeneity between=0.003). These finding should be interpreted with caution since several included studies had a low quality of evidence with a small sample size, a lack of adjustment on potential confounders or selection and intervention biases. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients. It raises the question of the hydroxychloroquine use outside of clinical trial. Additional results from larger randomised controlled trials are needed","Thibault, F.; Guihur, A.; Rebeaud, M.; Mulot, M.; Mahamat-Saleh, Y.",,95,3

During the Chinese Spring Festival holiday and the lockdown period, the concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 decreased by 6%-22%, 53%-70%, 34%-48%, 47%-64%, and 53%-60%, respectively. However, the changes in O3 concentrations were not consistent with the variations of human activities. The reduction rates for PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2 during the Spring Festival were greater than in previous years(2018 and 2019), but the reduction rates for SO2 were comparable. The concentrations of NO2 increased sharply(38%-138%), and much higher those of SO2(2%-42%), after the resumption of socioeconomic activities, indicating the importance of traffic reductions due to the lockdown measures on NO2. Higher wind speeds and rainfall after the Spring Festival were also favorable for the decline of SO2, NO2, and PM. The spatio-temporal distributions of the six criterial pollutants in the Xiamen Bay city cluster were obtained based on the Inverse Distance Weight method. The variability in regions with high NO2 concentrations was strongly linked to traffic emissions, while spatial patterns for CO and SO2 changed little over the six-week study period. The concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 increased notably in the region, linked to more construction activity, but changed comparatively little in regions with dense populations and traffic networks. O3 remained relatively stable but low-value regions corresponded to those regions with high NO2 concentrations, indicating the significant titration effect of NO2 on O3. These results provide valuable information that can inform O3 pollution reduction measures.","Xu, Chao; Wu, Shui-Ping; Liu, Yi-Jing; Zhong, Xue-Fen",Huan Jing Ke Xue,95,1

We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management. DESIGN: We adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome, to: 1) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between the coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome and the conventional acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2) assess the impact of different positive end-expiratory pressure, Fio(2,) and tidal volume settings. SETTING: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network. SUBJECTS: The simulator was calibrated to represent coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An acute respiratory distress syndrome model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on type 1 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi produced levels of ventilation perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from type 1 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, while preserving close-to-normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to positive end-expiratory pressure increments between 5 and 15 cm H(2)O were observed for this type 1 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome model across a range of measures: increasing positive end-expiratory pressure resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, whereas mechanical power, driving pressure, and plateau pressure all increased. Fio(2) settings based on acute respiratory distress syndrome network protocols at different positive end-expiratory pressure levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 mL/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator-induced lung injury in the type 1 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome model to those seen in a conventional acute respiratory distress syndrome model. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that use of standard positive end-expiratory pressure/Fio(2) tables, higher positive end-expiratory pressure strategies, and higher tidal volumes may all be potentially deleterious in type 1 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","Das, Anup; Saffaran, Sina; Chikhani, Marc; Scott, Timothy E.; Laviola, Marianna; Yehya, Nadir; Laffey, John G.; Hardman, Jonathan G.; Bates, Declan G.",Crit Care Explor,95,27

Because respirators are basic personal protective equipment to protect frontline healthcare workers against COVID-19, the chronic, global shortage of N95/N99 masks is one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives from the coronavirus. The reuse of masks may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability even though most of the masks are considered one-time use. Moreover, environmentalists warn that single-use masks add to the glut of plastic pollution, threatening the health of oceans and marine life. In this study, we develop a method to decontaminate respirators to reuse filtering facepiece respirators. Samples of SARS-CoV-2 are applied to the 4 × 4 cm(2) samples of FFP2 and FFP3 respirator materials. The filtration efficiency of plasma treated samples is measured using a planar particle image velocimetry technique with a neutrally charged polydisperse aerosol particle of NaCl. The measured viral decontamination and filtration efficiencies show that the developed plasma decontamination system can achieve a 4-log reduction for the coronavirus without reducing the filtration efficiency of masks after 5-min plasma exposure. The developed plasma decontamination system demonstrates the feasibility to tackle the acute shortages of FFRs in many countries and their environmental and economic burdens against discarding reusable masks.","Kim, Minkwan; Lawson, John; Hervé, Rodolphe; Jakob, Henrike; Ganapathisubramani, Bharathram; Keevil, Charles W.",AIP Adv,95,26

METHODS: The daily number of ED visits during the pandemic were analyzed in 3 different periods; prepandemic period (February 1st to March 11th, declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey), early pandemic period (March 12th to May 31th, period of strict measures), and late pandemic period (June 1st to July 31st, period of new norms). The pandemic periods were compared with the same timeframes in 2019 (comparison periods). Demographic variables and complaints of the patients on admission were investigated. RESULTS: The total number of ED visits in the study period in 2020 was 78,907, which was only the half of the applications in the same period in 2019 (n: 149,387). Data showed a sharp decrease at the number of daily visits to green and yellow zones after the announcement of the first case however red zone applications were more than twice that of the previous year. During pandemic nonspecific complaints was decreased and there was an increase at the percentages of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complaints. CONCLUSION: Number of ED visits during the pandemic were decreased by half when compared to the previous year. It was an advantage of the pandemic to decrease ED visits due to “nonemergent” complaints, and thus, unnecessary patient burden. However, on the other hand, patients avoided seeking medical attention, even for life-threatening conditions which led to increased mortality and morbidity.","Işık, Gülşah Çıkrıkçı; Çevik, Yunsur",Am J Emerg Med,95,26

En mars 2020, de nombreux cas ont été déclarés dans trois quartiers défavorisés où vit une importante communauté gitane. Une étude de séroprévalence a été menée en juillet 2020 afin d’évaluer le niveau de contamination dans ces quartiers à l’issue de la première vague et d’identifier des facteurs associés à la séropositivité. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude est une enquête transversale menée auprès de la population de 6 ans et plus de ces trois quartiers. Les logements ont été sélectionnés par tirage systématique et les participants par tirage aléatoire. Cette sélection a été réalisée par des enquêteurs terrain préalablement formés. La passation des questionnaires et les prélèvements sanguins des participants ont été effectués dans des centres Covid dédiés. Ces prélèvements ont été soumis à des tests de détection des anticorps IgG et IgM grâce au test immunologique EIecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2. La séroprévalence a été estimée sur les données redressées et des facteurs de risque associés ont été recherchés à partir d’un modèle de régression logistique. Résultats Au total, 700 personnes ont participé à l’étude. La séroprévalence des anticorps anti-SARS-CoV-2 était de 35,4% (IC95 % : 30,2–41,0), avec des variations significatives selon le quartier (13,9 %, 17,1 % et 46,7 %). Parmi les personnes séropositives, 21,7 % (14,1–31,8) n’avaient déclaré aucun symptôme entre le 24 février 2020 et la date d’enquête. Les femmes avaient un risque plus élevé d’être séropositives (odds ratio ajusté (ORa)=1,8 [1,0–3,3], p =0,034), de même que les personnes âgées de 15–64 ans en comparaison avec les personnes de 65 ans et plus (15–19 ans : ORa=9,1 [2,8–29,8], p <0,001 ; 20–64 ans : ORa=4,5 [2,0–10,1], p <0,001). La prévalence de l’obésité était de 40,7 % (35,8–45,8) et les personnes obèses étaient plus susceptibles d’être séropositives (ORa=2,0 [1,1–3,8], p =0,024). La présence de cas cliniques de la COVID-19 intrafamiliaux augmentait le risque d’être séropositif (Un cas : ORa=2,5 [1,3–5,0], p =0,007). Dans le quartier le plus touché, le risque d’être séropositif était supérieur pour les personnes vivant dans un logement de petite taille (1 ou 2 pièces vs 4 pièces ; ORa=2,8 [1,2–6,3], p =0,016). Le fait de travailler pendant le confinement était associé à une baisse de la probabilité de séropositivité (ORa=0,18 [0,03–1,0], p =0,048).

Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, play a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by receptor transmembrane serine protease 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SRS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.","Drak Alsibai, Kinan",Med Hypotheses,95,20

The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year’s Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called ‘super-spreading events’ emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host. India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing. All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended. Three hundred and forty-five patients across the country tested positive with six fatalities as of 22 March 2020. No specific anti-CoV drugs are currently available. Patients are being treated with protease drugs are inhibitors, remdesivir, chloroquine, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors, ivermectin, sarilumab and tocilizumab, though none of these is Food and Drug Administration approved and are undergoing trials. Preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, cough etiquettes, proper hand washing, cleaning and decontaminating the surfaces are the mainstay for curbing the transmission of this virus. The present review highlights the update of novel SARS-CoV-2 in context to the Indian scenario.","Gupta, Parakriti; Goyal, Kapil; Kanta, Poonam; Ghosh, Arnab; Singh, Mini P.",Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,95,11

The study consisted of 6 weeks participant observation and 37 semi-structured, open-ended interviews with community members. Stigmatizing discourses from the late 19th century resurfaced to blame Chinese culture and people for disease, and were recontextualized to fit contemporary local and global political-economic concerns. Many informants discursively distanced themselves from risk but simultaneously reaffirmed the association of Chinese culture with disease by redirecting such discourses onto recent Chinese immigrants. Legitimizing cultural blame obfuscates the structural and biological causes of epidemics and naturalizes health disparities in marginalized populations. This research demonstrates that myriad historical, political, and economic factors shape responses and risk perceptions during an unfamiliar epidemic, even in places without infection.","Eichelberger, Laura",Soc Sci Med,95,20

That is why continuum models based on theories of membrane elasticity are actively applied for the construction of physical models of membrane fusion. Started from the view on the membrane as a structureless film with postulated geometry of fusion intermediates, they developed along with experimental and computational techniques to a powerful tool for prediction of the whole process with molecular accuracy. In the present review, focusing on fusion processes occurring in eukaryotic cells, we scrutinize the history of these models, their evolution and complication, as well as open questions and remaining theoretical problems.

Our study tries to address this gap. Method: Six cohorts from China were analysed and a crude odds ratio was manually calculated. Results: Patients with a smoking history were approximately 2 times (95% CI= 1.036-1.883) as likely to suffer from severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 compared to patients without a smoking history. A higher percentage of males suffer more severe symptoms of COVID-19 in comparison to females, but this could be associated with the gender specific smoking trends observed in China. Conclusion: The gender specific smoking trends could be associated with the increased severity of COVID-19 disease manifestations in the male population.","Rodgers, A.; Indreberg, E.

Food and beverage manufacturers use trade promotion—incentives paid to retailers—to influence how products are placed, priced, and promoted in stores. This review aims to: (1) catalogue trade promotion practices that manufacturers use to influence retailer marketing strategies, and (2) describe how these retailer marketing strategies affect consumer purchasing behavior and attitudes. Researchers searched five databases, Academic Search Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science, to identify literature from industry and academic sources published in English through November 2019. Twenty articles describing manufacturer trade promotion practices were synthesized and provided insight into four types of trade promotion practices: category management, slotting allowances, price discounts, and cooperative advertising. Fifty-four articles describing the impact of retailer marketing on consumers were synthesized and graded for quality of evidence. While comparison across studies is challenging, findings suggest that retailer marketing strategies, such as price promotions and prominent placement, lead to increased sales. Results can guide efforts by policymakers, public health practitioners, and food retailers to design retail environments that improve healthy eating while maintaining retailer financial interests. Additional research should measure the impact of retailer marketing strategies on consumer diet quality and retailer outcomes (e.g., return-on-investment).","Hecht, Amelie A.; Perez, Crystal L.; Polascek, Michele; Thorndike, Anne N.; Franckle, Rebecca L.; Moran, Alyssa J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,95,16

Given the rising tide of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who require specialized medical treatment as well as the millions of others that are lining up for vaccinations, it can be assumed that many nursing professionals have had to endure such things as longer working hours, tighter schedules, and the intensity of a work environment in which failure of care and multiple deaths are the daily fare. This article proposes that nurses can avoid such severe consequences by taking up a regime of enhanced self-care management that enables them to achieve psychophysical balance and wellness. Three practices are highlighted in this regard: prayer, meditative walking, and the mindfulness practice of body scanning. Our suggestion is that these coping strategies will be both beneficial and healthful for nursing professionals in terms of enhancing their spiritual/existential resilience and meeting their own need for consolation as they navigate in an extremely difficult and demanding work environment.","Nilsson, Håkan",Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association,95,33

We used flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing to understand how the heterogeneity of this diverse cell population contributes to elements of viral tropism and pathogenesis, antiviral immunity, and treatment response to remdesivir. We found that, while a variety of epithelial cell types are susceptible to infection, ciliated cells are the predominant cell target of SARS-CoV-2. The host protease TMPRSS2 was required for infection of these cells. Importantly, remdesivir treatment effectively inhibited viral replication across cell types, and blunted hyperinflammatory responses. Induction of interferon responses within infected cells was rare and there was significant heterogeneity in the antiviral gene signatures, varying with the burden of infection in each cell. We also found that heavily infected secretory cells expressed abundant IL-6, a potential mediator of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Fiege, Jessica K.; Thiede, Joshua M.; Nanda, Hezkiel Arya; Matchett, William E.; Moore, Patrick J.; Montanari, Noe Rico; Thielen, Beth K.; Daniel, Jerry; Stanley, Emma; Hunter, Ryan C.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Shen, Steven S.; Bold, Tyler D.; Langlois, Ryan A.",PLoS Pathog,95,24

In a substantial number of cases the causative agent remains undetected. Since August 2014, an increase in Enterovirus(EV)‐D68 infections was reported. We aimed to investigate epidemiology and clinical relevance of EV‐D68. From June to December 2014 and from September to December 2015, 803 and 847 respiratory specimens, respectively, were tested for respiratory viruses with a multiplex RT‐PCR. This multiplex RT‐PCR does not detect EV‐D68. Therefore, 457 (2014) and 343 (2015) specimens with negative results were submitted to an EV‐specific‐RT‐PCR. EV‐positive specimens were tested with an EV‐D68‐specific‐RT‐PCR and genotyped. Eleven specimens of 2014 tested positive in the EV‐specific‐RT‐PCR and of these seven were positive in the EV‐D68‐specific‐RT‐PCR. Typing confirmed these as EV‐D68. Median age of EV‐D68‐positive patients was 3 years (1 month‐91 years). Common symptoms included fever (n = 6, 86%), respiratory distress (n = 5, 71%), and cough (n = 4, 57%). All EV‐D68‐positive patients were admitted to hospital, 4 (57%) were admitted to intensive care units and 6 (86%) received oxygen. One patient suffered from acute flaccid paralysis. Seven specimens of 2015 were positive in the EV‐specific‐RT‐PCR but negative in the EV‐D68‐specific‐RT‐PCR. In conclusion, use of an EV‐specific‐RT‐PCR allowed us to detect EV‐D68 circulation in autumn 2014 that was not detected by the multiplex RT‐PCR and was associated with severe disease.","Engelmann, Ilka; Fatoux, Marie; Lazrek, Mouna; Alidjinou, Enagnon K.; Mirand, Audrey; Henquell, Cécile; Dewilde, Anny; Hober, Didier",J Med Virol,95,15

Since the emergence of highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 variants in 2016, it has induced heavy losses in the poultry industry leading to the implementation of an intensive nationwide vaccination program at the end of wave 5 (September 2017). To characterize the ongoing evolution of H7N9 AIV, we conducted analyses of H7N9 glycoprotein genes obtained from 2013 to 2019. Bayesian analyses revealed a decreasing population size of HP H7N9 variants post wave 5. Phylogenetic topologies revealed that two novel small subclades were formed and carried several fixed amino acid mutations that were along HA and NA phylogenetic trees since wave 5. Some of the mutations were located at antigenic sites or receptor binding sites. The antigenic analysis may reveal a significant antigenic drift evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay and the antigenicity of H7N9 AIV might evolute in large leaps in wave 7. Molecular simulations found that the mutations (V135T, S145P, and L226Q) around the HA receptor pocket increased the affinity to α2,3-linked sialic acid (SIA) while decreased to α2,6-linked SIA. Altered affinity may suggest that HP H7N9 variations aggravate the pathogenicity to poultry but lessen the threat to public health. Selection analyses showed that the HP H7N9 AIV experienced an increasing selection pressure since wave 5, and the national implementation of vaccination might intensify the role of natural selection during the evolution waves 6 and 7. In summary, our data provide important insights about the genetic and antigenic diversity of circulating HP H7N9 viruses from 2017 to 2019. Enhanced surveillance is urgently warranted to understand the current situation of HP H7N9 AIV.","He, Dongchang; Gu, Jinyuan; Gu, Min; Wu, Huiguang; Li, Juan; Zhan, Tiansong; Chen, Yu; Xu, Naiqing; Ge, Zhichuang; Wang, Guoqing; Hao, Xiaoli; Wang, Xiaoquan; Hu, Jiao; Hu, Zenglei; Hu, Shunlin; Liu, Xiaowen; Liu, Xiufan",Infect Genet Evol,95,22

PURPOSE: To systematically review the main cardiac MRI findings in COVID‐19 adult survivors. STUDY TYPE: Systematic review. SUBJECTS: A total of 2954 COVID‐19 adult survivors from 16 studies. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), parametric mapping (T1‐native, T2, T1‐post (extracellular volume fraction [ECV]), T2‐weighted sequences (myocardium/pericardium), at 1.5 T and 3 T. ASSESSMENT: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, and Google scholar databases using Boolean operators and the relevant key terms covering COVID‐19, cardiac injury, CMR, and follow‐up. MRI data, including (if available) T1, T2, extra cellular volume, presence of myocardial or pericardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and left and right ventricular ejection fraction were extracted. STATISTICAL TESTS: The main results of the included studies are summarized. No additional statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 1601 articles retrieved from the initial search, 12 cohorts and 10 case series met our eligibility criteria. The rate of raised T1 in COVID‐19 adult survivors varied across studies from 0% to 73%. Raised T2 was detected in none of patients in 4 out of 15 studies, and in the remaining studies, its rate ranged from 2% to 60%. In most studies, LGE (myocardial or pericardial) was observed in COVID‐19 survivors, the rate ranging from 4% to 100%. Myocardial LGE mainly had nonischemic patterns. None of the cohort studies observed myocardial LGE in “healthy” controls. Most studies found that patients who recovered from COVID‐19 had a significantly greater T1 and T2 compared to participants in the corresponding control group.

METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed via Otomatch, Headmirror, and word of mouth to otolaryngology residency applicants in the 2021 Match. Survey items included demographics, social media usage, and impact of programs' social media on applicant perception and ranking. Descriptive statistics were performed, and responses based on demographic variables were compared using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Of 64 included respondents, nearly all (61/64, 95%) used Facebook, Instagram, and/or Twitter for personal and/or professional purposes. Applicants (59/64, 92%) most commonly researched otolaryngology residency programs on Instagram (55/59, 93%) and Twitter (36/59, 61%), with younger (P = .023) and female (P = .043) applicants being more likely to engage with programs on Instagram. Program accounts were most helpful in showcasing program culture (50/59, 85%) and highlighting its location (34/59, 58%). Nearly one third (19/59, 32%) reported that social media impacted their rank list. Age, gender, reapplication, home program status, or time taken off before and/or during medical school did not significantly influence social media's usefulness in the application cycle. CONCLUSION: Social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter are frequently used by applicants to assess otolaryngology residency programs. Programs' social media accounts effectively demonstrate program culture and affect applicants' rank lists. As social media usage continues to rise in the medical community, these findings can help otolaryngology residency programs craft a beneficial online presence that aids in recruitment, networking, and education.","Patro, Ankita; Landeen, Kelly C; Stevens, Madelyn N; Cass, Nathan D; Haynes, David S",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,95,16

The implementation of system-wide comprehensive tobacco cessation in the oncology setting has historically been low, with over half of cancer clinicians reporting that they do not treat or provide a referral to cessation resources. This quality improvement study evaluated the procedures for assessing and documenting tobacco use among cancer survivors and referring current smokers to cessation resources at the University of Virginia Cancer Center. Process mapping revealed 20 gaps across two major domains: electronic health record (EHR), and personnel barriers. The top identified priority was inconsistent documentation of tobacco use status as it impacted several downstream gaps. Eleven of the 20 gaps were deemed a high priority, and all were addressed during the implementation of the resulting Tobacco Treatment Program. Prioritized gaps were addressed using a combination of provider training, modifications to clinical workflow, and EHR modifications. Since implementation of solutions, the number of unique survivors receiving cessation treatment has increased from 284 survivors receiving cessation support during Year 1 of the initiative to 487 in Year 3. The resulting Tobacco Treatment Program provides a systematic, personalized, and sustainable comprehensive cessation program that optimizes the multifaceted workflow of the Cancer Center and has the potential to reduce tobacco use in a population most in need of cessation support.","Wiseman, Kara P.; Hauser, Lindsay; Clark, Connie; Odumosu, Onyiyoza; Dahl, Neely; Peregoy, Jennifer; Sheffield, Christina W.; Klesges, Robert C.; Anderson, Roger T.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,95,26

Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as a marker of hypercoagulability and MA ≥68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without a thrombotic complication. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. RESULTS: A total of 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (P < 0.01), while fibrinogen was positively correlated (P < 0.01). A fibrinogen >441 mg/dL was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA ≥68 mm. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with degree of hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may potentially reflect hemostatic perturbation in patients on ECMO or the severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation. Fibrinogen concentration may represent a more useful marker of hypercoagulability in this population.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Looby, Mary; Bade, Najeebah; Khangoora, Vikramjit; King, Christopher S.",J Intensive Care Med,95,16

As a result, UN agencies and programmes are increasingly seeking to understand and increase the extent to which persons with disabilities are accounted for and included in their efforts to provide life-saving assistance. To explore the effects and effectiveness of such measurement, this paper applies a complexity-informed, realist evaluation methodology to a case study of a single measurement intervention. This intervention, ‘A9’, was the first indicator designed to measure the number of persons with disabilities assisted annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Realist logic of analysis combined with complexity theory was employed to generate context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOC’s) against which primary interviews and secondary data were analysed. We show that within the complexity of the WFP system, the roll-out of the A9 measurement intervention generated delayed, counter-intuitive and unanticipated effects. In turn, path dependency and emergent behaviours meant that the intervention mechanisms of yesterday were destined to become the implementation context of tomorrow.

METHODS: We included 257 hospitalised patients with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 pneumonia from three teaching hospitals in Rhode Island. We extracted data from within the first 24 hours of admission. Variables were excluded if values were missing in >20% of cases, otherwise, missing values were imputed. One hundred and fifteen patients with complete data after imputation were used for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed after the exclusion of one variable (LDH) in the complete dataset (n = 257). Primary and secondary outcomes were in‐hospital mortality and critical illness (mechanical ventilation or death), respectively. RESULTS: Only the areas under the receiver‐operating characteristic curves (RO‐AUC) of COVID‐GRAM (RO‐AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.525‐0.915) for in‐hospital death, and CURB65 for in‐hospital death (RO‐AUC = 0.842, 95% CI 0.674‐0.932) or critical illness (RO‐AUC = 0.766, 95% CI 0.584‐0.884) were significantly better than random. Sensitivity analysis yielded similar trends. Calibration plots showed better agreement between the estimated and observed probability of in‐hospital death for CURB65, compared with COVID‐GRAM. The negative predictive value (NPV) of CURB65 ≥2 was 97.2% for in‐hospital death and 88.1% for critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐GRAM score demonstrated acceptable predictive performance for in‐hospital death. The CURB65 score had better prognostic utility for in‐hospital death and critical illness. The high NPV of CURB65 values ≥2 may be useful in triaging and allocation of resources.","Shi, Yiyun; Pandita, Aakriti; Hardesty, Anna; McCarthy, Meghan; Aridi, Jad; Weiss, Zoe F.; Beckwith, Curt G.; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios",Int J Clin Pract,95,20

OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a literature review on placental changes in infected pregnant women and/or asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 during pregnancy, aiming at the possible vertical transmission. METHODOLOGY: A systematic collection was carried out on the effects of that COVID-19 can cause directly and/or indirectly to pregnancy and the placenta in the following databases: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs and Web of Science. For search, the following descriptors were used: placenta, pregnant woman, COVID-19, maternal-fetal. RESULTS: The results indicate transplacental transmission in some cases reviewed in many reports from this study. The presence of the virus was seen in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and peripheral blood. Finally, pathological studies suggest that there are morphological changes related to infection in the placentas. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that, based on the researched material, there is little evidence of transplacental vertical viral transmission and its respective morphological changes related to viral infection in the placenta.","Costa, Marcos Aurélio Santos; Albuquerque Britto, Diana Babini Lapa; Silva, Maria Eduarda; Carvalho, Jennyfer Martins; Oliveira, Maria Luísa Figueira; Silva Gomes, José Anderson; Tenorio, Fernanda das Chagas Angelo Mendes; Leite, Sônia Pereira",Biol Reprod,95,16

COVID‐19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is currently under investigation. We summarized clinical studies and other research data available as of May 5, 2020, on CCP therapy according to the Clinical Treatment Guideline of COVID‐19 Convalescent Plasma in China, as well as clinical experience at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, as part of a comprehensive anti‐epidemic strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As of May 5, 2020, when the epidemic was well‐controlled in China, healthcare databases and sources of English literature relating to convalescent plasma were searched and reviewed. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. RESULTS: As of May 5, 2020, up to 2,000 samples of CCP had been collected across China and administered to 700 COVID‐19 patients. From donors, 200–400 mL of plasma were collected at each donation, with antibody titers >1:160. We identified three clinical studies for COVID‐19 in China. Analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared with untreated cases (P<0.001). No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: From initial studies, convalescent plasma therapy appears effective and safe for COVID‐19. However, there is clearly a need for well‐designed RCTs (randomized controlled trials) or other formal studies to further evaluate the efficacy and any potential adverse effects of CCP.","Chen, Binzhen; Xia, Rong",Vox Sang,95,16

A systematic review and thematic analysis of 28 studies on the Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic and the global spread of Ebola Virus Disease. We found seven major factors that promote vaccine hesitancy or acceptance: demographic factors influencing vaccination (ethnicity, age, sex, pregnancy, education, and employment), accessibility and cost, personal responsibility and risk perceptions, precautionary measures taken based on the decision to vaccinate, trust in health authorities and vaccines, the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine, and lack of information or vaccine misinformation. An understanding of participant experiences and perspectives toward vaccines from previous pandemics will greatly inform the development of strategies to address the present situation with the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the impact vaccine hesitancy might have for the introduction and effectiveness of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. In particular, we believe that skepticism toward vaccines can still exist when there are no vaccines available, which is contrary to contemporary conceptualizations of vaccine hesitancy. We recommend conducting further research assessing the relationship between the accessibility and cost of vaccines, and vaccine hesitancy.","Truong, Judy; Bakshi, Simran; Wasim, Aghna; Ahmad, Mobeen; Majid, Umair",Health promot. internation,95,16

The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy responses to COVID‐19 is also tested. Using daily data over the period January 4, 2010 to August 31, 2020, and controlling for a host of domestic and global macroeconomic and financial factors, we use a fixed effects panel approach and a structural VAR framework to show that emerging markets have been more heavily affected than advanced economies. In particular, emerging economies in Asia and Europe have experienced the sharpest impacts on stock, bond and exchange rates due to COVID‐19, as well as abrupt and substantial capital outflows. Quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus packages mainly helped to boost stock prices, notably for advanced and emerging economies in Asia. Our findings also highlight the role that global factors and developments in the world's leading financial centers have on financial conditions in EMEs. Importantly, the impact of COVID‐19 related quantitative easing measures by central banks in advanced countries extended to EMEs, with significant positive spillovers to EME stock markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Going forward, while the ultimate resolution of COVID‐19 may be expected to lead to a market correction as uncertainty declines, our impulse response analysis suggests that there may be persistent effects on bond markets in emerging Europe and on EME capital flows.","Beirne, John; Renzhi, Nuobu; Sugandi, Eric; Volz, Ulrich",Pacific Economic Review,95,30

Nineteen articles (n=2,713 patients; 73.3% females) met our eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. There was a negative correlation between self-compassion and psychosocial outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Moreover, based on self-compassion intervention, there was an improvement in clinical outcomes related to diabetes such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose levels. This systematic review highlights the effect of self-compassion on psychosocial and clinical outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS Travelers spread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 globally and continue to spread variants. The characteristics of the virus, the place, and time created a perfect storm that allowed the virus to quickly spread globally. The virus spread by every mode of travel with risk of transmission influenced by proximity to an infected person, duration of trip, physical characteristics of the space, and ventilation. Superspreading events were common; a small percentage of infected people accounted for most of transmission. The travel and tourist industry was devastated as lockdowns and quarantines severely restricted domestic and international travel. A trip includes multiple segments and shared sequential spaces, mostly indoors. Creating safe travel requires attention to all segments of a trip. SUMMARY The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected every part of travel and travel medicine. The rapid development of multiple safe and effective vaccines and their deployment is allowing resumption of travel, yet many populations lack access to vaccines, and high levels of transmission continue in many areas. Providing documentation of vaccination or immunity in a consistent, verifiable, interoperable system is one of many active issues.","Wilson, Mary E",Current opinion in infectious diseases,95,1

The reaction to lockdown was slow and not homogeneous with spots of negligible noise reduction, especially in the first week. A fresh interpretation of seismic noise variations in terms of socio-economic indicators sheds new light on the lockdown efficacy pointing to the causes of such delay: the noise reduction is significant where non strategic activities prevails, while it is small or negligible where dense population and strategic activities are present. These results are crucial for the a posteriori interpretation of the pandemic diffusion and the efficacy of differently targeted political actions.","Piccinini, Davide; Giunchi, Carlo; Olivieri, Marco; Frattini, Federico; Di Giovanni, Matteo; Prodi, Giorgio; Chiarabba, Claudio",Sci Rep,95,14

There has been limited data to recommend either for or against use of antiviral regimens in mild COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral drugs and those without. METHOD: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at field hospital affiliated to Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were evaluated between January 1, 2020 and April 13, 2021. Patients’ data, clinical presentation, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with positive tests were included in the study. The mean age was 35.9 years; 46% males. There were 225 (45%), 207 (41.4%), 44 (8.8%), 18 (3.6%), 6 (1.2%) patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Of 207 mild COVID-19 patients, 9 (4.3%) received lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir, 17 (8.2%) received favipiravir, while 175 (84.5%) had only supportive care. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral treatment had longer median length of hospital stay [13 days (IQR 11–14) vs. 10 days (IQR 8–12), p < 0.001] than patients having only supportive treatment. Antiviral drug use was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (>10 days) in mild COVID-19 patients (OR 5.52; 95%CI 2.12–14.40, p < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis were also demonstrated in our COVID-19 patients with antiviral treatments. Majority of patients (97.6%) recovered without any complications and were discharged home. Two deaths were caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatment could not provide superior clinical outcomes to supportive care in mild COVID-19 patients. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral medication had longer length of hospital stay than those without. Standard supportive care and regular monitoring of disease progression might be keys for successful management of mild COVID-19.","Aumpan, Natsuda; Vilaichone, Ratha-korn; Ratana-Amornpin, Sarita; Teerakapiba, Surat; Toochinda, Pisanu; Witoonchart, Gasinee; Nitikraipot, Surapon",J Infect Public Health,95,14

The mechanisms of viral exacerbation and remission have become of interest in the neurosciences with circumstantial evidence that some role is played by viruses in multiple sclerosis. Epidemiological data indicate that multiple sclerosis results from exposure to a virus in childhood followed by a long latency period. The clinical course is typically remitting and relapsing, and the brain and spinal cord contain multifocal demyelinative lesions of different ages. Studies of slow viral infections have now provided many explanations for long incubation periods and studies of both acute and persistent viral infections have shown varied mechanisms of demyelination. Several recent studies of latent and persistent viral infections have provided thought-provoking data on episodic disease.","Johnson, Richard T.",Trends in Neurosciences,95,1

Nowadays, their disposal represents an increasing environmental concern due to its toxicity and organic nature. With the estimated increase of coffee production and consumption in the upcoming years, there is an imperative need to find a proper reverse option, along with a novel industrial application, which allows for the valorization of this coffee by-product within a circular economy perspective. This study aims at investigating a potential reuse of spent coffee grounds to produce novel construction materials to be used for sustainable buildings. METHODS: After having illustrated the forward flows within the coffee life cycle and the potential reverse flow options, an evaluation method based on multi-criteria analyses was elaborated to test not only the technical but also the environmental and economic performances of novel materials originating from the incorporation of SCG as an aggregate in natural hydraulic lime and geopolymer-based mortars. Moreover, we focus on the reuse of another waste streams— biomass fly ash—deriving from the paper-pulp industry, rarely investigated in both traditional construction applications and in geopolymer manufacture. The two (geopolymer- and lime-based) mortar typologies are here studied and compared as potential green material for applications in construction, with satisfying engineering performance and high insulation attitude, giving a new life to a common organic waste. Consequently, we compare eight formulations by means of multi-criteria approaches that are nowadays claimed as a useful and effective decision aiding support instrument to assess the development of new sustainable construction materials. They permit to consider simultaneously some controversial and often uncertain aspects like technological (as the usual scientific studies do), environmental, and economic (more difficult to easily approach and evaluate). For this purpose, in this paper, we have analyzed the performance of the novel bio-composite mortars using VIKOR and TOPSIS methods to rank a set of alternatives according to various evaluation criteria that often conflict one with each other. RESULTS: Results show that adding spent coffee grounds can efficiently improve the technical and sustainable performances of the novel mortars for different applications in the building sector. The presence of SCG increases water absorption and improves the insulation performance along with an environmental impact reduction. The considered technological properties are highly promising—such as the improvement in thermal insulation. In particular, even the addition of only 5% SCG leads to a significant reduction of the thermal conductivity and consequently to a greater insulating performance. CONCLUSIONS: To date, most of the available literature on recycling SCG in construction materials do not consider mortar-based applications and, moreover, nor multi-criteria approaches. Therefore, our study proposes itself as an innovative track solution to food waste management lowering the employment of non-renewable natural resources and the costs associated to construction material production. At the same time, a novel and innovative way of such waste disposal is suggested, pursuing the sustainability and substantially reducing the environmental impact of construction and building materials. This study is a fundamental step in assessing the applicability of our designed and produced materials and its potentials to be produced at an industrial scale.","La Scalia, Giada; Saeli, Manfredi; Miglietta, Pier Paolo; Micale, Rosa",Int J Life Cycle Assess,95,1

This study followed the impact of COVID 19 in the initial Australian COVID 19 surge. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study which examined data from the centre's local CPRS transplant database, Australia and New Zealand Organ Donation Registry and hospital medical records from 01st Jan 2017 to 31st August 2020. Organ donation patterns, cause of donor deaths, recipient characteristics and transplant surgery volumes were monitored. Results Over the 8 months, from 1st of January to 31st August, there were 26 lung transplants in 2020 compared to 35 in the same period in 2019 at the centre. Suicide and overdose became 2.65 times more likely as causes of donor death at the centre and 1.60 times more likely nationally. Heart attack and stroke became less likely causes of donor death. Lung transplant recipients were more likely to have a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, but had on average improved measures of pre-surgical frailty and improved operative outcomes. The exception to this was ICU time and ventilatory time, which increased on average. MOCA scores improved on average, suggestive of better mental acuity. Indicators of mental health were worse in the 2020 cohort, based on the average dmi10 depression screening score. Conclusion There was a 69.23% decline in volume of organ transplantation as of August 2020. With the initial surge of cases the transplant volumes decreased dramatically, however with “lockdown” and control of “COVID cases” the lung transplant rates increased. The Victorian outbreak from August further diminished rates of transplant due to travel restrictions, however the NSW based unit managed to maintain lung transplant levels with local donors and minor interstate referrals. An increase in physical robustness corresponds to increased referral and uptake of “prehabilitation” by waitlisted patients.","Johal, M. S.; Granger, E.

Cremations are performed for most deaths in Ontario and require coroner certification before the cremation can take place. Our objective was to provide timely analysis of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic using cremation data. Methods: This study describes cremation certificate data from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020, in Ontario. Cremation records during 2020 were compared to historical records from 2017-2019, grouped according to age, month, and place of death and further stratified by COVID-19 involvement. A time series model was fit to quantify the deviation in cremation trends during the COVID-19 period. Results: There have been 33 834 cremations in Ontario in 2020, and 20 898 (62%) took place from March onwards. In April, which saw the peak number of COVID-19 cases, had an additional 1,830 cremations compared to historical averages over 2017-2019, representing a 32% increase (3 871 in 2020). Time series modelling of cremations in Ontario from January 2017 demonstrated that cremations in March, April, and May 2020 exceeded the predicted increase based on modelled estimates. Even without the COVID-19 deaths, the seasonal and numerical trends for 2020 are substantially different from the historical period. Interpretation: Cremations were higher in the months during the pandemic compared to previous years. These early estimates of mortality are critical for understanding the impact of COVID-19. This study has demonstrated the utility of cremation data to provide timely mortality information during a public health emergency.","Postill, G.; Murray, R.; Wilton, A.; Wells, R.

Unfortunately, confiscated live animals often experience substandard care. In this study, we investigate the barriers to the ‘disposal’ of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia. ‘Disposal’ is the term used for what happens to illegally traded wildlife after confiscation. Guidelines for the ‘disposal’ of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual nations must enforce this within their own legislation. We interviewed 18 experts from seven countries in Southeast Asia revealing eight categories of barriers to the disposal of confiscated live animals. We then propose seven recommendations to help reform the disposal of confiscated live animals, which would support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife in Southeast Asia and globally. ABSTRACT: Increased focus on the illegal global wildlife trade has resulted in greater numbers of live animals confiscated by authorities, increasing the need to manage these animals responsibly. Most wildlife seizures take place in Southeast Asia, with global demand for live animals fuelling much of the trafficking. Guidelines for the ‘disposal’ of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual Parties must implement provisions through national laws and regulations. ‘Disposal’ is the term used for the management of illegally traded wildlife upon confiscation. Confiscated live animals can be euthanised (i.e., killed), repatriated to their native country and released, or kept in captivity. This study investigates barriers to proper care and disposal of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia, where roughly one quarter of the global multibillion dollar illegal wildlife trade takes place. Interviews were conducted with 18 professionals working within conservation, wildlife crime, and confiscated live animal management. Eight limitations to the proper care and disposal of confiscated wildlife were identified: (1) political will, (2) policy, (3) funding, (4) capacity, (5) expertise (6) attitudes and behaviours, (7) exploitation, and (8) corruption. Based on interviews, we propose seven key reforms to support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife for national authorities and CITES parties. These are wildlife seizure management, legislative support, enhanced political will, demand reduction, global participation, registry of rescue centres, and terminology change. This research highlights major barriers to the proper care and disposal of live confiscated animals and proposes key reforms to improve the conservation of threatened species and the welfare of millions of illegally traded animals.","Rivera, Shannon N.; Knight, Andrew; McCulloch, Steven P.",Animals (Basel),95,2

Pesaro–Urbino province was included for further investigation as it was comparably affected by the epidemic despite being the area far from the Po valley. Moving means of the variables were considered to take into account the variability of incubation periods and uncertainties in the epidemiological data. The same analyzes were performed normalizing the number of new daily cases based on the number of checks performed. For each province, the moving mean of adjusted and unadjusted new daily cases were independently plotted versus each meteorological parameter, and linear regressions were determined in the period from 29th of February 2020 to 29th of March 2020. Strong positive correlations were observed between new cases and temperatures within three provinces representing 86.5% of the contagions. Strong negative correlations were observed between the moving means of new cases and relative humidity values for four provinces and more than 90% of the contagions.","Passerini, Giorgio; Mancinelli, Enrico; Morichetti, Mauro; Virgili, Simone; Rizza, Umberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,95,23

Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the interactions among SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells, macrophage, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby offering important insights into new therapeutic strategies. Here, we used directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to establish a lung and macrophage co-culture system and model the host-pathogen interaction and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the hPSC-derived lung cells, alveolar type II and ciliated cells are the major cell populations expressing the viral receptor ACE2 and co-effector TMPRSS2, and both were highly permissive to viral infection. We found that alternatively polarized macrophages (M2) and classically polarized macrophages (M1) had similar inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, only M1 macrophages significantly up-regulated inflammatory factors including IL-6 and IL-18, inhibiting growth and enhancing apoptosis of lung cells. Inhibiting viral entry into target cells using an ACE2 blocking antibody enhanced the activity of M2 macrophages, resulting in nearly complete clearance of virus and protection of lung cells. These results suggest a potential therapeutic strategy, in that by blocking viral entrance to target cells while boosting anti-inflammatory action of macrophages at an early stage of infection, M2 macrophages can eliminate SARS-CoV-2, while sparing lung cells and suppressing the dysfunctional hyper-inflammatory response mediated by M1 macrophages.","Duan, Fuyu; Guo, Liyan; Yang, Liuliu; Han, Yuling; Thakur, Abhimanyu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Wang, Pengfei; Zhang, Zhao; Ma, Chui Yan; Zhou, Xiaoya; Han, Teng; Zhang, Tuo; Wang, Xing; Xu, Dong; Duan, Xiaohua; Xiang, Jenny; Tse, Hung-fat; Liao, Can; Luo, Weiren; Huang, Fang-Ping; Chen, Ya-Wen; Evans, Todd; Schwartz, Robert E.; tenOever, Benjamin; Ho, David D.; Chen, Shuibing; Lian, Qizhou; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce",Res Sq,95,20

Objective To evaluate the association between the COVID-19 lockdown and the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Botswana. Study Design In response to COVID-19, Botswana enforced a lockdown that restricted movement within the country. We used data from an ongoing nationwide birth outcomes surveillance study to evaluate adverse outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age [SGA], and neonatal death) and severe adverse outcomes (stillbirth, very preterm birth, very SGA, and neonatal death) recorded pre-lockdown (January 1 – April 2), during lockdown (April 3 – May 7), and post-lockdown (May 8 – July 20). Using difference-in-differences analyses, we compared the net change in each outcome from the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020 relative to the same two periods in 2017-2019, and the net change in each outcome from the pre-lockdown to post-lockdown periods in 2020 relative to the same two periods in 2017-2019. Results 68,448 women delivered a singleton infant in 2017-2020 between January 1 and July 20 and were included in our analysis (mean [interquartile range] age of mothers, 26 [22,32] years). Across the included calendar years and periods, the risk of any adverse outcome ranged from 27.92% to 31.70% and the risk of any severe adverse outcome ranged from 8.40% to 11.38%. The lockdown period was associated with a 0.81 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -2.95%, 1.30%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (3% relative reduction) and a 0.02 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -0.79%, 0.75%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (0% relative reduction). The post-lockdown period was associated with a 1.72 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -3.42%, -0.02%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (5% relative reduction) and a 1.62 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -2.69%, -0.55%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (14% relative reduction). Reductions in adverse outcomes were largest among women with HIV and among women delivering at urban delivery sites, driven primarily by reductions in preterm birth and SGA. Conclusions Adverse birth outcomes decreased from the pre-lockdown to post-lockdown periods in 2020, relative to the change during the same periods in 2017-2019. Our findings may provide insights into associations between mobility and birth outcomes in Botswana and other low- and middle-income countries.","CANIGLIA, Ellen C.; MAGOSI, Lerato E.; ZASH, Rebecca; DISEKO, Modiegi; MAYONDI, Gloria; MABUTA, Judith; POWIS, Kathleen; DRYDEN-PETERSON, Scott; MOSEPELE, Mosepele; LUCKETT, Rebecca; MAKHEMA, Joseph; MMALANE, Mompati; LOCKMAN, Shahin; SHAPIRO, Roger",Am J Obstet Gynecol,95,16

Studies revealed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased under this condition. PTSD can change the structure of patients’ central nervous system, and increase the risk of anxiety or depression, thus greatly affecting the quality of patients’ life and their families. PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application. METHODS: The literatures that are related to the smartphone app based intervention and PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials repositories, PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 investigators would independently screen the literature extract data and evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our study could provide evidence for the judgment of whether smartphone app based intervention is an effective intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients.

A Comparative Ethnography of Subsistence Strategies in Argentina, Ecuador, and Mexico",14.834605,5.4265804,2021-09-11,"Background: To assign a cause of death to non-medically certified deaths, verbal autopsies (VAs) are widely used to determine the cause of death. The time difference between the death and the VA interview, also referred to as recall time, varies depending on social and operational factors surrounding the death. We investigated the effect of recall time on the assignment of causes of death by VA. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of 2002-2015 survey data of the Nairobi Urban Health Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The independent variable recall time was derived from the date of death and the date when the VA was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to calculate odds ratios of assigning a cause of death in defined categories of recall time. Results: There were 6218 deaths followed up between 2002 and 2016, out of which 5495 (88.3%) had VAs done. Recall time varied from 1-3001 days (median 92 days, IQR 44-169 days). Majority of the VAs (45.7%) were conducted between 1-3 months after death. The effect of recall time varied for different diseases. Compared to VAs conducted between 1-3 months, there was a 24% higher likelihood of identifying HIV/AIDS as the cause of death for VAs conducted 4-6 months after death (AOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.54; p-value = 0.043) and a 40% increased chance of identifying other infectious diseases as the cause of death for VAs conducted <1 month after death (AOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.02-1.92, p-value = 0.024). Conclusions: Recall time affected the assignment of VA cause of death for HIV/AIDS, other infectious diseases,maternal/neonatal and indeterminate causes. Our analysis indicates that in the urban informal setting, VAs should be conducted from one month up to 6 months after the death to improve the probability of accurately assigning the cause of death.","Mategula, Donnie; Gichuki, Judy",Wellcome Open Res,95,1

This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. METHODS: We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. CONCLUSIONS: This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","Slavova, Svetla; Rock, Peter; Bush, Heather M.; Quesinberry, Dana; Walsh, Sharon L.",Drug Alcohol Depend,95,0

We investigated the occluded essential vessel tributaries, both arterial and venous, occluded superior mesenteric vein and artery in rats, consequent noxious syndrome, peripherally and centrally. As therapy, we hypothesized the rapidly activated alternative bypassing pathways, arterial and venous, and the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 since it rapidly alleviated venous occlusion syndromes. Methods. Assessments were performed for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress), including portal hypertension, caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension; systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, including brain (swelling, and cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus lesions). Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 min ligation-time. Results. BPC 157 rapidly activated collateral pathways. These collateral loops were the superior mesenteric vein-inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein-pyloric vein-portal vein pathway, an alternative pathway toward inferior caval vein via the united middle colic vein and inferior mesenteric vein through the left colic vein, and the inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior mesenteric artery. Consequently, BPC 157 counteracted the superior sagittal sinus, portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, progressing venous and arterial thrombosis peripherally and centrally, ECG disturbances attenuated. Markedly, the multiple organs lesions, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues were attenuated. Conclusions.

Methods: Optum de-identified Electronic Health Record dataset (2021-01-07 release) were used to find cancer pts with a C19 positive (ICD-9/10-CM codes U071/U072 or positive test result) or negative (negative test and no positive test at any time after the first negative result) status on the first test/diagnosis date (ie the “index date”). Pts with <1 year database history, with no tx 0-90 days before index, <18 years old, with implausible death dates, and with index dates outside of 02/2020 - 11/2020 were excluded. C19 positive and negative pts were exact-matched on cancer type, then 1:1 nearest-neighbor matched on propensity scores (variables in table). Missing values were imputed (n = 5), and outcomes were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression, including interaction terms between tx and C19 positivity. Results: We identified 21,060 pts, of whom 1,636 (7.8%) were positive for C19 and 19,424 (92.2%) negative. Among 1,636 matched pairs of positive/negative C19 pts, the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality comparing C19 positive vs negative patients was 2.14 (95% CI: 0.71 – 6.52). Among the strongest predictors of 30-day mortality were age 75+ (OR = 5.42, 95% CI: 2.21 – 13.28), inpatient C19 testing/diagnosis (OR = 4.78, 95% CI: 3.04, 7.53), CCI of 3+ (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.30 – 3.89), and metastatic disease (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.21 – 2.68). Anti-cancer therapies do not appear to modulate risk of death due to C19. Beyond 30-day mortality, matched mortality rate ratios (MRRs) suggested increased risk for C19 positive patients (MRR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.26 – 2.44). [Formula presented] Conclusions: C19 showed a trend towards increased 30-day mortality risk (not statistically significant), and increased overall mortality risk.

Patients who have received solid-organ transplants are more susceptible to infections in general due to the use of immunosuppressants. We investigated factors associated with mechanical ventilation and outcomes in solid-organ transplant recipients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all solid-organ transplant recipients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in our 23-hospital health system over a 1-month period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe hospital course and laboratory results and bivariate comparisons were performed on variables to determine differences. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with solid-organ transplants and COVID-19 were identified. Eight patients were admitted to the ICU, of which 7 were intubated. Admission values of CRP (p = 0.045) and N/L ratio (p = 0.047) were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (32%) died during admission, including 86% (n = 6) of patients who received mechanical ventilation.

An increase in knowledge transfer, meetings and overall communication among researchers and practitioners is a logical consequence of the previous. However, the resulting higher transaction costs, mainly related to transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (and additional financial costs) involved in face-to-face meetings, are in direct conflict with the urgent need to reduce our carbon footprint. This research explored the development of an online platform, “CoLabS”, specifically designed as a virtual meeting and learning space to support collaboration within and between communities to accelerate sustainable community development efforts. While the move towards online collaboration in virtual environments has steadily increased in the past decade, it has now become essential due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Risk stratification: group 1—mild disease (asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic); group 2—moderate disease (required hospital admission with no acute respiratory distress) and group 3—severe disease (subjects who developed an acute respiratory distress were admitted in the intensive care unit and presented interleukin 6 values above 40 pg/mL). Age-matched volunteers with negative serology tests were enrolled to control group. A colour photograph, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and an angiography using OCT centred on the fovea were performed. RESULTS: Control group included 27 subjects: group 1 included 24 patients, group 2 consisted of 24 patients and 21 participants were recruited for group 3. There were no funduscopic lesions, neither in the colour images nor in the structural OCT. Fovea-centred vascular density (VD) was reduced in group 2 and group 3 compared with group 1 and control group (control group vs group 2; 16.92 vs 13.37; p=0.009) (control group vs group 3; 16.92 vs .13.63; p=0.026) (group 1 vs group 2; 17.16 vs 13.37; p=0.006) (group 1 vs group 3; 17.16 vs 13.63 p=0.017). CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had decreased central retinal VD as compared with that of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic cases or control subjects.","Zapata, Miguel Ángel; Banderas García, Sandra; Sánchez, Adrián; Falcó, Anna; Otero-Romero, Susana; Arcos, Gabriel; Velazquez-Villoria, Daniel; García-Arumí, Jose",Br J Ophthalmol,95,11

The biosynthesis of these compounds could be affected by genetic inheritance and epigenetic modification. However, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds are rarely known. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the biosynthesis gene expression of these compounds was related to histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation levels. These active compounds content of L. japonica were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. H3K4me3 showed a positive correlation with chlorogenic acid and loganic acid content, and H3K9me positively correlated with luteolin content. The correlation between histone methylation levels and the levels of luteolin and loganic acid in L. japonica from different producing areas validate the regulatory role of histone methylation in biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. Our study demonstrated a potential regulatory network of H3K9/H3K4 methylation to gene expression and content of secondary metabolites, and provided a basis for understanding the mechanism underlying the variation of major bioactive compounds in L. japonica.

DESIGN: A two‐wave online survey conducted one week apart during the national lockdown (April, 2020). MEASURES: A sample of 477 UK residents completed baseline measures from the reasoned action approach (experiential attitudes, instrumental attitudes, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, capacity, autonomy, and intention) and perceived susceptibility for each of the following recommended behaviours: limiting leaving home, keeping at least 2 m away from other people when outside and when inside shops, not visiting or meeting friends or other family members, and washing hands when returning home. Self‐reported compliance with each of the recommended behaviours was assessed one week later. RESULTS: Rates of full compliance with the recommended behaviours ranged from 31% (keeping at least 2 m away from other people when inside shops) to 68% (not visiting or meeting friends or other family members). Capacity was a significant predictor of compliance with each of the five recommended behaviours. Increasing age and intentions were also predictive of compliance with three of the behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase compliance with the recommended behaviours to prevent the transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, especially those relating to social distancing, need to bolster people’s intentions and perceptions of capacity. This may be achieved through media‐based information campaigns as well as environmental changes to make compliance with such measures easier. Such interventions should particularly target younger adults.","Norman, Paul; Wilding, Sarah; Conner, Mark",Br J Health Psychol,95,1

The importance of virus detection to prevent the spread of viruses has been reaffirmed by the pandemic and the associated social and economic damage. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in microscale and localized SPR (LSPR) in nanoscale virus sensing systems are thought to be useful as next-generation detection methods. Many studies have been conducted on ultra-sensitive technologies, especially those based on signal amplification. In some cases, it has been reported that even a low viral load can be measured, indicating that the virus can be detected in patients even in the early stages of the viral infection. These findings corroborate that SPR and LSPR are effective in minimizing false-positives and false-negatives that are prevalent in the existing virus detection techniques. In this review, the methods and signal responses of SPR and LSPR-based virus detection technologies are summarized. Furthermore, this review surveys some of the recent developments reported and discusses the limitations of SPR and LSPR-based virus detection as the next-generation detection technologies.","Takemura, Kenshin",Biosensors (Basel),95,32

It causes symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea, but it is rare to see elderly patients who develop SPM. Here we report the case of an elderly patient diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who neither got mechanical ventilation nor had chest trauma but were found to develop SPM for unknown reason. CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old man complained of a 14-d history of fever accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was treated with supplementary oxygen by nasal cannula and gamma globulin. Other symptomatic treatments included antibacterial and antiviral treatments. On day 4 of hospitalization, he reported sudden onset of dyspnea. On day 6, he was somnolent. On day 12, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain which eventually progressed to bilateral chest pain. He was diagnosed with SPM, with no clear trigger found. Conservative treatment was administrated. During follow-up, the pneumomediastinum had resolved and the patient recovered without other complications. CONCLUSION: We presume that aging lung changes and bronchopulmonary infection play an important part in the onset of SPM in COVID-19, but severe acute respiratory syndrome may represent a separate pathophysiologic mechanism for pneumomediastinum. Although the incidence of SPM in elderly patients is low, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of SPM in those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for life-threatening complications such as cardiorespiratory arrest may occur.","Kong, Ning; Gao, Chen; Xu, Mao-Sheng; Xie, Yuan-Liang; Zhou, Chang-Yu",World J Clin Cases,95,20

Very few studies have investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 within the nasopharynx, the site of initial infection and viral replication. In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. Acinetobacter) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections. Additionally, we observed a robust host transcriptional response in the nasal epithelia of COVID patients, indicative of an antiviral innate immune repones and neuronal damage. Finally, analysis of viral genomes did not reveal an association between viral loads and viral sequences.","Rhoades, Nicholas S.; Pinski, Amanda; Monsibais, Alisha N.; Jankeel, Allen; Doratt, Brianna M.; Cinco, Isaac R.; Ibraim, Izabela; Messaoudi, Ilhem",bioRxiv,95,10

After that the virus spread all around the world and at the time of writing this paper the total number of confirmed cases are above 4 million with over 297000 deaths. Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process. The aim of this work is twofold. First, a quantitative analysis where we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and proposed a simple CNN architecture with less parameters and computational power that can perform as good as Xception and DenseNet architectures if trained on small dataset of chest X-ray images. Secondly, a qualitative investigation to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM). Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed most to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating regions in the input image. Chest X-ray images used in this work are coming from multiple sources which comprises of 154 confirmed COVID-19 images and over 5000 X-rays of normal, bacterial and other viral (non-COVID-19) infections. We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration until radiologist/clinicians can visually inspect the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction. This work also reports the necessity of segmenting the region of interest (ROI) to prevent CNNs building their decision from features outside ROI.","Majeed, T.; Rashid, R.; Ali, D.; Asaad, A.",,95,1

These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah D.",J Subst Abuse Treat,95,20

In this study, we investigated the possible effect of several local socio-economic factors on the case count and time course of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths across the twenty one counties of New Jersey. Socio-economic and geographic factors considered included population, percentage of elders in the population, percentage of low-income households, access to food and health facilities and distance to New York. We found that the counties could be clustered into three groups based on (a) the case totals, (b) the total number of deaths, (c) the time course of the cases and (d) the time course of the deaths. The four groupings were very similar to one another and could all be largely explained by the county population, the percentage of low-income population, and the distance of the county from New York. As for food and health factors, the numbers of local restaurants and pharmacies significantly influenced the total number of cases and deaths as well as the epidemic’s evolution. In particular, the number of cases and deaths showed a decrease with the number of McDonald’s within the county in contrast to other fast-food or non-fast food restaurants. Overall, our study found that the evolution of the epidemic was influenced by certain socio-economic factors, which could be helpful for the formulation of public health policies.","Amaratunga, Dhammika; Cabrera, Javier; Ghosh, Debopriya; Katehakis, Michael N.; Wang, Jin; Wang, Wenting",Ann Oper Res,95,20

The dictionary-based approach has been adopted to process abbreviations, but it cannot handle ad hoc abbreviations, and it is impossible to cover all abbreviations. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an automatic abbreviation expansion method called LMAAE (Language Model-based Automatic Abbreviation Expansion). In this method, the abbreviation is firstly divided into blocks; then, expansion candidates are generated by restoring each block; and finally, the expansion candidates are filtered and clustered to acquire the final expansion result according to the language model and clustering method. Through restrict the abbreviation to prefix abbreviation, the search space of expansion is reduced sharply. And then, the search space is continuous reduced by restrained the effective and the length of the partition. In order to validate the effective of the method, two types of experiments are designed. For standard abbreviations, the expansion results include most of the expansion in dictionary. Therefore, it has a high precision. For ad hoc abbreviations, the precisions of schema matching, knowledge fusion are increased by using this method to handle the abbreviations. Although the recall for standard abbreviation needs to be improved, but this does not affect the good complement effect for the dictionary method.","Du, Xiaokun; Zhu, Rongbo; Li, Yanhong; Anjum, Ashiq",Future Gener Comput Syst,95,32

FcRn plays a role in the function of IVIg because the supraphysiological IgG levels derived from IVIg administrations saturate the FcRn allowing the endogenous IgG to be degraded, instead of being recycled, resulting in high levels of infused IgG ensuring IVIg efficiency. New data in myasthenia gravis patients suggest that the that the Variable Number of Tandem 3/2 (VNTR3/2) polymorphisms in FCGRT, the gene that encodes FcRn, may affect the duration of infused IgG in the circulation and IVIg effectiveness. This review addresses these implications in the context of whether the FCGRT genotype, by affecting the half-life of IVIg, may also play a role in up to 30% of patients with autoimmune neurological diseases, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, CIDP or Multifocal Motor Neuropathy, who did not respond to IVIg in controlled trials. The concern is of practical significance because in such patient subsets super-high IVIg doses may be needed to achieve high IgG levels and ensure efficacy. Whether FCGRT polymorphisms affect the efficacy of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies by influencing their distribution clearance and pharmacokinetics, explaining their variable effectiveness, is also addressed. Finally, the very promising effect of monoclonal antibodies that inhibit FcRn, such as efgartigimod, rozanolixizumab and nipocalimab, in treating antibody-mediated neurological diseases is discussed along with their efficacy in the IgG4 subclass of pathogenic antibodies and their role in the blood–brain barrier endothelium, that abundantly expresses FcRn.","Dalakas, Marinos C.; Spaeth, Peter J.",Ther Adv Neurol Disord,95,28

However, there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of sociodemographic characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US national survey study was conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 as measured by survey response.

Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes (coefficient on earning ≥$100 000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American respondents (−9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −13.1 to −5.7 percentage points; P < .001), Hispanic respondents (−4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −8.9 to −0.77 percentage points; P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (−10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −14.1 to −6.5 percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.","Alsan, Marcella; Stantcheva, Stefanie; Yang, David; Cutler, David",JAMA Netw Open,95,16

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System. PATIENTS: Those hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 8, 2020, and July 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: A temporal coronavirus disease 2019 test positive cut point of June 1 was used to separate the development from validation cohorts. Fine and Gray competing risk regression modeling was performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The development set contained 4,520 patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 between March 8, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The validation set contained 3,150 patients who tested positive between June 1 and July 13. Approximately 9% of patients were admitted to the ICU or died of coronavirus disease 2019 within 2 weeks of testing positive. A prediction cut point of 15% was proposed. Those who exceed the cutoff have a 21% chance of future severe coronavirus disease 2019, whereas those who do not have a 96% chance of avoiding the severe coronavirus disease 2019. In addition, application of this decision rule identifies 89% of the population at the very low risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (< 4%). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and internally validated an algorithm to assess whether someone is at high risk of admission to the ICU or dying from coronavirus disease 2019, should he or she test positive for coronavirus disease 2019. This risk should be a factor in determining resource allocation, protection from less safe working conditions, and prioritization for vaccination.","Kattan, Michael W.; Ji, Xinge; Milinovich, Alex; Adegboye, Janet; Duggal, Abhijit; Dweik, Raed; Khouli, Hassan; Gordon, Steve; Young, James B.; Jehi, Lara",Crit Care Explor,95,0

Aspiration is an important cause of NHAP, but it may not require antimicrobial treatment. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AP infections and review the need for empirical antibiotics with atypical coverage in NHAP. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four nursing homes with a total number of 772 residents. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were aged ≥ 65 years, hospitalized for NHAP, which was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs, from April 2006 to March 2007. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, clinical parameters, and investigation results were recorded. Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. RESULTS: After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test. None of the patients with AP infection received antibiotics indicated for AP infections. However, AP infections did not result in mortality. No pathogen was isolated in 31.5% of cases. Patients without pathogens isolated were less likely to have purulent sputum and crepitations on chest auscultation, compared with those with pneumonia caused by identified pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens (APs) were not associated with mortality even in cases where the prescribed antibiotics did not cover APs. NHAP may not necessarily be treated with empirical antibiotics covering APs.","Ma, Hon Ming; Ip, Margaret; Hui, Elsie; Chan, Paul K.S.; Hui, David S.C.; Woo, Jean",J Am Med Dir Assoc,95,26

Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with COVID-19-like illness during the second epidemic wave in Paris, France, among which 100 and 50 were positive and negative for RNA SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Results Overall, the Ag-RDT showed high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 90.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 98.1%, respectively, as well as high or almost perfect agreement (93.3%), reliability assessed by Cohen's κ coefficient (0.86), and accuracy assessed by Youden’s J index (90%) to detect SARS-CoV-2. The analytical performances of the Ag-RDT remained high in the event of significant viral excretion (i.e., N gene Ct values ≤ 33 by reference rtRT-PCR), while the sensitivity of the Ag-RDT dropped to 69.6% with low or very low viral shedding (Ct> 33). Conclusions The SIENNA™ Ag-RDT presents excellent analytical performances for viral loads ≤ 33 Ct, classically corresponding to situations of symptomatic COVID-19 and/or proven contagiousness.","Mboumba Bouassa, Ralph-Sydney; Veyer, David; Péré, Hélène; Bélec, Laurent",Int J Infect Dis,95,33

We analyzed transcriptomic and proteomic expression metadata for SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 and entry associated proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, and FURIN) in silico across immune system components including the blood lineage cells. ACE2 was not detected in any of the studied immune cell components; however, varying transcriptomic and proteomic expressions were observed for TMPRSS2, CTSL, and FURIN. Nondetectable expressions of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2 in immune system components or blood lineage cells indicate it does not mediate immune cell lesions in COVID-19.

This interest is mainly due to the fact that the projections may help the government agencies in making decisions in relation to procedures of prevention of the disease. Since the growth of the number of cases (and deaths) of COVID-19, in general, has presented a heterogeneous evolution over time, it is important that the modeling procedure is capable of identifying periods with different growth rates and proposing an adequate model for each period. Here, we present a modeling procedure based on the fit of a piecewise growth model for the cumulative number of deaths. We opt to focus on the modeling of the cumulative number of deaths because, other than for the number of cases, these values do not depend on the number of diagnostic tests performed. In the proposed approach, the model is updated in the course of the pandemic, and whenever a “new” period of the pandemic is identified, it creates a new sub-dataset composed of the cumulative number of deaths registered from the change point and a new growth model is chosen for that period. Three growth models were fitted for each period: exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The best model for the cumulative number of deaths recorded is the one with the smallest mean square error and the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. This approach is illustrated in a case study, in which we model the number of deaths due to COVID-19 recorded in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The results have shown that the fit of a piecewise model is very effective for explaining the different periods of the pandemic evolution.","Saraiva, Erlandson Ferreira; de Bragança Pereira, Carlos Alberto",Entropy (Basel),95,1

Evidence shows that such a climate is deleterious to mental health and may increase demand for mental health services in emergency departments. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before and after the COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between January–August 2019 and January–August 2020 with emergency department encounter as the sampling unit. The primary outcome was the proportion of all emergency department encounters attributed to mental health. We performed chi-square analyses to evaluate the differences between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We found that overall emergency department volume declined between 2019 and 2020, while the proportion attributable to mental health conditions increased (p < 0.01). Substance abuse, anxiety, and mood disorders accounted for nearly 90% of mental health diagnoses during both periods. When stratified by sex, substance abuse was the leading mental health diagnosis for males and anxiety and substance abuse disorders combined accounted for the largest proportion for females. DISCUSSION: The emergency department is an important community resource for the identification and triage of mental health emergencies. This role is even more important during disasters and extended crises, making it imperative that emergency departments employ experienced mental health staff. This study provides a comparison of emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before the pandemic and during the spring 2020 surge and may serve as a useful guide for hospitals, health systems and communities in future planning.","Stroever, Stephanie; Brett, Chelsea; Michael, Katherine; Petrini, Joann",Am J Emerg Med,95,1

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe and 880 non‐severe cases. All patients were followed up for 3 months after discharge. The symptomatic features and follow‐up data of the patients in both groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60.0%), cough (50.8%) and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms. In total, 32.7% of the severe cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, which was significantly higher than that of the non‐severe group (P = 0.0015). The incidence of olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia was only 3.1% and 6.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for over 5 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00‐3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.26‐5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (OR 14.19, 95% CI 7.01‐28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID‐19. During the follow‐up, cough (6.2%), dyspnea (7.2%), fatigue (1.8%), olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia (1.5%) were the significant remaining symptoms.

METHODS: Air sampling was performed at infected Dutch mink farms, at farm premises and at nearby residential sites. A range of other environmental samples were collected from minks’ housing units, including bedding materials. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was analysed in all samples by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Inside the farms, considerable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found in airborne dust, especially in personal inhalable dust samples (approximately 1000–10 000 copies/m(3)). Most of the settling dust samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (82%, 75 of 92). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in outdoor air samples, except for those collected near the entrance of the most recently infected farm. Many samples of minks’ housing units and surfaces contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Infected mink farms can be highly contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This warns of occupational exposure, which was substantiated by considerable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in personal air samples. Dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 to outdoor air was found to be limited and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in air samples collected beyond farm premises, implying a negligible risk of environmental exposure to nearby communities. Our occupational and environmental risk assessment is in line with whole genome sequencing analyses showing mink-to-human transmission among farm workers, but no indications of direct zoonotic transmission events to nearby communities.","de Rooij, Myrna M T; Hakze-Van der Honing, Renate W; Hulst, Marcel M; Harders, Frank; Engelsma, Marc; van de Hoef, Wouter; Meliefste, Kees; Nieuwenweg, Sigrid; Oude Munnink, Bas B; van Schothorst, Isabella; Sikkema, Reina S; van der Spek, Arco N; Spierenburg, Marcel; Spithoven, Jack; Bouwstra, Ruth; Molenaar, Robert-Jan; Koopmans, Marion; Stegeman, Arjan; van der Poel, Wim H M; Smit, Lidwien A M",Occup Environ Med,95,5

This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.","Larsen, Joseph R.; Martin, Margaret R.; Martin, John D.; Kuhn, Peter; Hicks, James B.",Front Public Health,95,24
679729,679729,679729,Correction,14.886707,5.2823744,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since 2015, the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) Zika and chikungunya have spread across the Americas causing outbreaks, accompanied by increases in immune-mediated and infectious neurological disease. The spectrum of neurological manifestations linked to these viruses, and the importance of dual infection, are not known fully. We aimed to investigate whether neurological presentations differed according to the infecting arbovirus, and whether patients with dual infection had a different disease spectrum or severity. METHODS: We report a prospective observational study done during epidemics of Zika and chikungunya viruses in Recife, Pernambuco, a dengue-endemic area of Brazil. We recruited adults aged 18 years or older referred to Hospital da Restauração, a secondary-level and tertiary-level hospital, with suspected acute neurological disease and a history of suspected arboviral infection. We looked for evidence of Zika, chikungunya, or dengue infection by viral RNA or specific IgM antibodies in serum or CSF. We grouped patients according to their arbovirus laboratory diagnosis and then compared demographic and clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2014, and Dec 4, 2016, 1410 patients were admitted to the hospital neurology service; 201 (14%) had symptoms consistent with arbovirus infection and sufficient samples for diagnostic testing and were included in the study. The median age was 48 years (IQR 34–60), and 106 (53%) were women. 148 (74%) of 201 patients had laboratory evidence of arboviral infection. 98 (49%) of them had a single viral infection (41 [20%] had Zika, 55 [27%] had chikungunya, and two [1%] had dengue infection), whereas 50 (25%) had evidence of dual infection, mostly with Zika and chikungunya viruses (46 [23%] patients). Patients positive for arbovirus infection presented with a broad range of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease. Chikungunya infection was more often associated with CNS disease (26 [47%] of 55 patients with chikungunya infection vs six [15%] of 41 with Zika infection; p=0·0008), especially myelitis (12 [22%] patients). Zika infection was more often associated with PNS disease (26 [63%] of 41 patients with Zika infection vs nine [16%] of 55 with chikungunya infection; p≤0·0001), particularly Guillain-Barré syndrome (25 [61%] patients). Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome who had Zika and chikungunya dual infection had more aggressive disease, requiring intensive care support and longer hospital stays, than those with mono-infection (median 24 days [IQR 20–30] vs 17 days [10–20]; p=0·0028). Eight (17%) of 46 patients with Zika and chikungunya dual infection had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, compared with five (6%) of 96 patients with Zika or chikungunya mono-infection (p=0·047). INTERPRETATION: There is a wide and overlapping spectrum of neurological manifestations caused by Zika or chikungunya mono-infection and by dual infections. The possible increased risk of acute cerebrovascular disease in patients with dual infection merits further investigation.

This study compared treatment failure rates of levofloxacin with those of other antibiotics in a large US sample. METHODS|: Medical and pharmacy claims in the nationally representative SDI database were used to identify adults with a new outpatient diagnosis of CAP receiving a study antibiotic (levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, moxifloxacin) between September 1, 2005 and March 31, 2008. Treatment failure was defined as ≥1 of the following events ≤30 days after index date: a refill for the index antibiotic after completed days of therapy, a different antibiotic dispensed >1 day after the index prescription, or hospitalization with a pneumonia diagnosis or emergency department visit >3 days postindex. Cohorts were propensity score matched for demographic and clinical characteristics. Treatment failure rates were compared between pairs of cohorts for the full sample and for high-risk patients (age ≥65 and/or on Medicaid). RESULTS|: Among the 3994 study patients, the numbers of dispensed index prescriptions were 268 for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 1609 for azithromycin, 1460 for levofloxacin, and 657 for moxifloxacin. Unadjusted treatment failure rates for the sample were 20.8% for levofloxacin, 23.9% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 23.9% for azithromycin, and 19.9% for moxifloxacin. For high-risk patients, unadjusted treatment failure rates were 19.1% for levofloxacin, 26.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 26.3% for azithromycin, and 24.3% for moxifloxacin. Propensity score-matched treatment failure rates were significantly lower with levofloxacin than azithromycin (19.8% vs. 24.5%, odds ratio [OR] comparator vs. levofloxacin 1.38; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.67), a difference amplified in high-risk patients (19.0% vs. 26.4%, OR 1.61; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.13). No significant differences were observed for other paired comparisons. CONCLUSION|: In a large US sample, treatment failure in CAP appeared to be less likely with quinolones (such as levofloxacin) than azithromycin, an effect particularly marked in high-risk patients (age ≥65 and/or on Medicaid).","Hess, Gregory; Hill, Jerrold W.; Raut, Monika K.; Fisher, Alan C.; Mody, Samir; Schein, Jeff R.; Chen, Chi-Chang",Adv Ther,95,5

The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate COVID-19 typical imaging findings from other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability, that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pre-test probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT vs. RT-PCR.

Serological and genetic tests for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were performed because the calf was born from a cow infected with BLV. The serum had a weakly positive BLV antibody, and the BLV provirus was detected within neoplastic cells on performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of the BLV provirus integration site using inverse PCR revealed that the BLV integration site location was identical on all chromosomes in all tumor tissues examined. Thus, the tumor cells monoclonally proliferated following BLV infection. The present study shows that enzootic bovine leukosis can occur in a young animal, as in the two-month-old calf in our study.","Oguma, Keisuke; Suzuki, Miho; Sentsui, Hiroshi",Virus Res,95,33

Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old female nurse rapidly developed shortness of breath, cough, and agitation after denatonium benzoate fit testing. She had a history of allergy to shrimp, crab, mite, and disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium). DIAGNOSES: Due to typical symptoms of asthma after exposure to denatonium benzoate aerosol without any other apparent cause, serial pulmonary function tests indicating obstructive lung function and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E, she was diagnosed with allergic asthma. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. OUTCOMES: The patient showed quick responses after treatment with diphenhydramine (intramuscularly), fenoterol HBr (inhalation), and prednisolone (oral). Approximately 2 weeks later, she suffered from difficulty breathing and asthmatic symptoms again when she was exposed to polished wax and disinfectant. She was treated with omalizumab (Xolair), corticosteroid, β(2) agonist, montelukast, and Symbicort turbuhaler. The patient was in stable condition with improvement in symptoms during follow-up. LESSONS: There may be potentially important health risks when healthcare workers are exposed to denatonium benzoate. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is needed in the future.","Chen, Kou-Huang; Chung, Kuo-Mou; Chung, Ju-Hui; Chen, Kow-Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),95,21

The presence of viral RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients' viral load. Since the demand for laboratory reagents has increased, there has been a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. We, therefore, developed a fast and cost-effective viral genome isolation method that, combined with quantitative RT-PCR assay, detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples. The method relies on the addition of Proteinase K followed by a controlled heat-shock incubation and, then, E gene evaluation by RT-qPCR. It was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision. It detects as low as 10 viral copies/sample, is rapid, and has been characterized in 60 COVID-19-infected patients. Compared to automated extraction methods, our pretreatment guarantees the same positivity rate with the advantage of shortening the time of the analysis and reducing its cost. This is a rapid workflow meant to aid the healthcare system in the rapid identification of infected patients, such as during a pathogen-related outbreak. For its intrinsic characteristics, this workflow is suitable for large-scale screenings.","Mio, Catia; Cifù, Adriana; Marzinotto, Stefania; Bergamin, Natascha; Caldana, Chiara; Cattarossi, Silvia; Cmet, Sara; Cussigh, Annarosa; Martinella, Romina; Zucco, Jessica; Verardo, Roberto; Schneider, Claudio; Marcon, Barbara; Zampieri, Stefania; Pipan, Corrado; Curcio, Francesco",Dis Markers,95,1

Dried blood spots (DBS), which can be collected in nonclinical settings, provide a minimally invasive alternative to serum for serosurveys. We developed a Luminex-based SARS-CoV-2 microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for DBS that detects IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) and spike subunit 1 (S1) antigens. The assay uses a 384-well plate format and automated liquid handlers for high-throughput capacity. Specificity was assessed using a large collection of prepandemic DBS and well-characterized sera. Sensitivity was analyzed using serology data from New York State SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey testing and matched diagnostic test results. For DBS, the specificity was 99.5% for the individual N and S1 antigens. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for DBS and paired sera showed a strong positive correlation for N (R2 = 0.91) and S1 (R2 = 0.93). Sensitivity, assessed from 1,134 DBS with prior laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranged from 83% at 0 to 20 days to 95% at 61 to 90 days after a positive test. When stratified using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptom data, sensitivity ranged from 90 to 96% for symptomatic and 77 to 91% for asymptomatic individuals. For 8,367 health care workers reporting detailed symptom data, MFI values were significantly higher for all symptom categories. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG DBS MIA is sensitive, specific, and well-suited for large population-based serosurveys. The ability to readily modify and multiplex antigens is important for ongoing assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses to emerging variants and vaccines. IMPORTANCE Testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has been used to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in different populations. Seroprevalence studies, or serosurveys, were especially useful during the early phase of the pandemic when diagnostic testing was not widely available, and the resulting seroprevalence estimates played an important role in public health decision making. To achieve meaningful results, antibody tests used for serosurveys should be accurate and accessible to diverse populations. We developed a test that detects antibodies to two different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in dried blood spots (DBS). DBS require only a simple fingerstick and can be collected in nonclinical settings. We conducted a robust validation study and have demonstrated that our test is both sensitive and specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our test is suitable for large-scale serosurveys by testing over 56,000 DBS collected in a variety of community-based venues in New York State during the spring of 2020.","Styer, Linda M; Hoen, Rebecca; Rock, Jean; Yauney, Erica; Nemeth, Katherine; Bievenue, Rachel; Parker, Monica M",Microbiol Spectr,95,1

Data on early virological response are limited. To iden-tify potential predictors of antibody durability, circulating antibody levels were longitudinally ex-plored in healthcare workers included in a follow-up program for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meth-ods: Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria signed an informed consent. Serum samples were col-lected at baseline, before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, at days 7, 21, 31, 90, and 180 days after the first dose. Serological evaluation was performed by QuantiVac Euroimmune anti-S1 antibody as-say. Only subjects followed-up until day 90 are here considered. Results: Of 340 taken into consid-eration, 265 subjects were naive, and 75 COVID-19 experienced. The former showed a progres-sive increase in their antibody levels before day 90 decline, while the latter showed antibody levels reaching a plateau at day 7 and slightly declining at day 90. All showed antibody levels higher than the assay cut-off at day 31 and 90. Among naive, 108 had an early response whose predic-tors were younger age and female gender (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.96, p < 0.0001; and OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.48–4.51, p = 0.0009). Naive subjects experienced a day 30/90 decline in antibody levels, whereas experienced did not. Early response was an independent predictor of higher day 30/90 antibody levels decline (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.04–4.02; p = 0.037). Conclusions: Our results suggest that in healthcare workers early response might be inversely associated with antibody levels 90 days after BNT162b2 vaccine.","Cocomazzi, Giovanna; Piazzolla, Valeria; Squillante, Maria Maddalena; Antinucci, Stefano; Giambra, Vincenzo; Giuliani, Francesco; Maiorana, Alberto; Serra, Nicola; Mangia, Alessandra",Vaccines (Basel),95,32

We utilized an online quantitative and qualitative survey to characterize the practices of RDs treating patients with IMDs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify challenges and unmet needs. We received responses from 117 RDs. Results indicate that RDs are using alternate methods to engage this vulnerable population and provide MNT during the pandemic, including offering telemedicine appointments. Barriers to implementation of telemedicine include the limitations of virtual visits (inability to conduct physical exams and collect blood samples), time, patient knowledge of technology, audio problems, and patient access to internet, computers, or smartphones. RDs have addressed these barriers by extending prescriptions without a medical exam, relying on local facilities for blood draws, increasing the number of patients that use at-home filter papers for blood monitoring, and expanding the use of phone calls and emails. RDs identified patient education materials to facilitate telemedicine visits as a primary unmet need. Despite the reported barriers and limitations of telemedicine for MNT of IMDs, there was widespread satisfaction with the approach among RDs, with 96.9% reporting that they were somewhat or very satisfied with telemedicine. Although this survey focused on barriers, benefits of telemedicine for both RDs and patients were also reported. Identification of barriers and unmet needs can help clinics plan strategies to maximize telemedicine delivery models, to improve efficiency and patient outcomes, and to support sustained use of telemedicine post-pandemic.","Singh, Rani H.; Pringle, Theresa; Kenneson, Aileen",Front Nutr,95,16

Environmental monitoring has significant promise even following widespread vaccination among high-risk populations. The goal of this work is to demonstrate molecular severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) monitoring in bulk floor dust and related samples as a proof of concept of a noninvasive environmental surveillance methodology for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and potentially other viral diseases. Surface swab, passive sampler, and bulk floor dust samples were collected from the rooms of individuals positive for COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 was measured with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) and two digital PCR (dPCR) methods. Bulk dust samples had a geometric mean concentration of 163 copies/mg of dust and ranged from nondetects to 23,049 copies/mg of dust detected using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). An average of 89% of bulk dust samples were positive for the virus by the detection methods compared to 55% of surface swabs and fewer on the passive sampler (19% carpet, 29% polystyrene). In bulk dust, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 76%, 93%, and 97% of samples measured by qPCR, chip-based dPCR, and droplet dPCR, respectively. Detectable viral RNA in the bulk vacuum bags did not measurably decay over 4weeks, despite the application of a disinfectant before room cleaning. Future monitoring efforts should further evaluate RNA persistence and heterogeneity in dust. This study did not measure virus infectivity in dust or potential transmission associated with dust. Overall, this work demonstrates that bulk floor dust is a potentially useful matrix for long-term monitoring of viral disease in high-risk populations and buildings.","Renninger, N.; Nastasi, N.; Bope, A.; Cochran, S.

However, no studies have been conducted to examine the effect of simulation on nursing students’ knowledge and confidence in performing critical care skills in Jordan. PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the effect of simulation on university nursing students' knowledge and confidence in performing critical care skills for patients with cardiac, respiratory and neurological health problems. METHOD: A randomized controlled (pre-test-post-test) design was implemented. The experimental group (n=38) attended 9 simulation scenarios, theoretical lectures and clinical training in hospital about cardiac, respiratory and neurological health problems, while the control group (n=38) attended only the theoretical lectures and clinical training in hospital. Knowledge and confidence were measured using knowledge exam and self-confidence scale respectively. RESULTS: A paired t-test indicated that mean knowledge and confidence regarding implementing critical care skills were significantly higher P< 0.001 in the post-test than that in the pre-test, in both the experimental and the control group. However, independent t test revealed that the students in the experimental group scored significantly higher P< 0.001 than control group in both knowledge and confidence regarding performing critical care skills. CONCLUSION: Theoretical and clinical training is valuable teaching strategies that help enhance knowledge and confidence in applying critical care skills. However, adding simulation has a more significant effect than theoretical and clinical training in improving nursing students' knowledge and confidence in performing critical care nursing skills.

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from more than one thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods: Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia, and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in 7 languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian). Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions. Results: 1047 participations (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%), and others (3%) were included in the analysis. Findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. Large decreases (p < 0.001) in the amount of social activity through family (−58%), friends/neighbors (−44.9%), or entertainment (−46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower life satisfaction (−30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, the social contact score through digital technologies significantly increased (p < 0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (+24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion: These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the early COVID-19 home confinement period in 2020. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested.","Ammar, Achraf; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Trabelsi, Khaled; Masmoudi, Liwa; Brach, Michael; Bouaziz, Bassem; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Mueller, Patrick; Mueller, Notger; Hsouna, Hsen; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sophia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna-Dos-Santos, Leonardo Jose; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L.; Strahler, Jana; Washif, Jad Adrian; Andreeva, Albina; khoshnami, Samira C.; Samara, Evangelia; Zisi, Vasiliki; Sankar, Parasanth; Ahmed, Waseem N.; Romdhani, Mohamed; Delhey, Jan; Bailey, Stephen J.; Bott, Nicholas T.; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; Abed, Kais El; Souissi, Nizar; Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette Van; Riemann, Bryan L.; Riemann, Laurel; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan; Epstein, Monique; Sanderman, Robbert; Schulz, Sebastian; Jerg, Achim; Al-Horani, Ramzi; Mansi, Taiysir; Jmail, Mohamed; Barbosa, Fernando; Ferreira-Santos, Fernando; Šimunič, Boštjan; Pišot, Rado; Pišot, Saša; Gaggioli, Andrea; Zmijewski, Piotr; Apfelbacher, Christian; Steinacker, Jürgen; Saad, Helmi Ben; Glenn, Jordan M.; Chamari, Karim; Driss, Tarak; Hoekelmann, Anita",Int J Environ Res Public Health,95,22
