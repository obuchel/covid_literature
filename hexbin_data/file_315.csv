1670,1670,1670,"Mortality attributable to Plasmodium vivax malaria: a clinical audit from Papua, Indonesia",15.299275,6.6604714,2014-11-18,"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax causes almost half of all malaria cases in Asia and is recognised as a significant cause of morbidity. In recent years it has been associated with severe and fatal disease. The extent to which P. vivax contributes to death is not known. METHODS: To define the epidemiology of mortality attributable to vivax malaria in southern Papua, Indonesia, a retrospective clinical records-based audit was conducted of all deaths in patients with vivax malaria at a tertiary referral hospital. RESULTS: Between January 2004 and September 2009, hospital surveillance identified 3,495 inpatients with P. vivax monoinfection and 65 (1.9%) patients who subsequently died. Charts for 54 of these 65 patients could be reviewed, 40 (74%) of whom had pure P. vivax infections on cross-checking. Using pre-defined conservative criteria, vivax malaria was the primary cause of death in 6 cases, a major contributor in 17 cases and a minor contributor in a further 13 cases. Extreme anaemia was the most common primary cause of death. Malnutrition, sepsis with respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, and chronic diseases were the commonest attributed causes of death for patients in the latter two categories. There were an estimated 293,763 cases of pure P. vivax infection in the community during the study period giving an overall minimum case fatality of 0.12 per 1,000 infections. The corresponding case fatality in hospitalised patients was 10.3 per 1,000 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommonly directly fatal, vivax malaria is an important indirect cause of death in southern Papua in patients with malnutrition, sepsis syndrome and chronic diseases, including HIV infection.","Douglas, Nicholas M; Pontororing, Gysje J; Lampah, Daniel A; Yeo, Tsin W; Kenangalem, Enny; Poespoprodjo, Jeanne Rini; Ralph, Anna P; Bangs, Michael J; Sugiarto, Paulus; Anstey, Nicholas M; Price, Ric N",BMC Med,315,22
2661,2661,2661,Deposition efficiency of inhaled particles (15-5000 nm) related to breathing pattern and lung function: an experimental study in healthy children and adults,15.200967,6.6485467,2017-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to airborne particles has a major impact on global health. The probability of these particles to deposit in the respiratory tract during breathing is essential for their toxic effects. Observations have shown that there is a substantial variability in deposition between subjects, not only due to respiratory diseases, but also among individuals with healthy lungs. The factors determining this variability are, however, not fully understood. METHOD: In this study we experimentally investigate factors that determine individual differences in the respiratory tract depositions of inhaled particles for healthy subjects at relaxed breathing. The study covers particles of diameters 15–5000 nm and includes 67 subjects aged 7–70 years. A comprehensive examination of lung function was performed for all subjects. Principal component analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between subject characteristics and particle deposition. RESULTS: A large individual variability in respiratory tract deposition efficiency was found. Individuals with high deposition of a certain particle size generally had high deposition for all particles <3500 nm. The individual variability was explained by two factors: breathing pattern, and lung structural and functional properties. The most important predictors were found to be breathing frequency and anatomical airway dead space. We also present a linear regression model describing the deposition based on four variables: tidal volume, breathing frequency, anatomical dead space and resistance of the respiratory system (the latter measured with impulse oscillometry). CONCLUSIONS: To understand why some individuals are more susceptible to airborne particles we must understand, and take into account, the individual variability in the probability of particles to deposit in the respiratory tract by considering not only breathing patterns but also adequate measures of relevant structural and functional properties.

3286,3286,3286,Febrile seizures: an overview,15.089013,6.6672173,2018-07-16,"BACKGROUND: Febrile seizures are the most common neurologic disorder in childhood. Physicians should be familiar with the proper evaluation and management of this common condition. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the current understanding, evaluation, and management of febrile seizures. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms ‘febrile convulsions’ and ‘febrile seizures’. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. RESULTS: Febrile seizures, with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months of age, likely result from a vulnerability of the developing central nervous system to the effects of fever, in combination with an underlying genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The majority of febrile seizures occur within 24 hours of the onset of the fever. Febrile seizures can be simple or complex. Clinical judgment based on variable presentations must direct the diagnostic studies which are usually not necessary in the majority of cases. A lumbar puncture should be considered in children younger than 12 months of age or with suspected meningitis. Children with complex febrile seizures are at risk of subsequent epilepsy. Approximately 30–40% of children with a febrile seizure will have a recurrence during early childhood. The prognosis is favorable as the condition is usually benign and self-limiting. Intervention to stop the seizure often is unnecessary. CONCLUSION: Continuous preventative antiepileptic therapy for the prevention of recurrent febrile seizures is not recommended. The use of intermittent anticonvulsant therapy is not routinely indicated. Antipyretics have no role in the prevention of febrile seizures.","Leung, Alexander KC; Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Theresa NH",Drugs Context,315,1
4022,4022,4022,Study design and protocol for investigating social network patterns in rural and urban schools and households in a coastal setting in Kenya using wearable proximity sensors,15.573174,6.495985,2019-08-22,"Background: Social contact patterns shape the transmission of respiratory infections spread via close interactions. There is a paucity of observational data from schools and households, particularly in developing countries. Portable wireless sensors can record unbiased proximity events between individuals facing each other, shedding light on pathways of infection transmission. Design and methods: The aim is to characterize face-to-face contact patterns that may shape the transmission of respiratory infections in schools and households in Kilifi, Kenya. Two schools, one each from a rural and urban area, will be purposively selected. From each school, 350 students will be randomly selected proportional to class size and gender to participate. Nine index students from each school will be randomly selected and followed-up to their households. All index household residents will be recruited into the study. A further 3-5 neighbouring households will also be recruited to give a maximum of 350 participants per household setting. The sample size per site is limited by the number of sensors available for data collection. Each participant will wear a wireless proximity sensor lying on their chest area for 7 consecutive days. Data on proximal dyadic interactions will be collected automatically by the sensors only for participants who are face-to-face. Key characteristics of interest include the distribution of degree and the frequency and duration of contacts and their variation in rural and urban areas. These will be stratified by age, gender, role, and day of the week. Expected results: Resultant data will inform on social contact patterns in rural and urban areas of a previously unstudied population. Ensuing data will be used to parameterize mathematical simulation models of transmission of a range of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, and used to explore the impact of intervention measures such as vaccination and social distancing.","Kiti, Moses Chapa; Melegaro, Alessia; Cattuto, Ciro; Nokes, David James",Wellcome Open Res,315,1
4184,4184,4184,Potential impact of diabetes prevention on mortality and future burden of dementia and disability: a modelling study,15.15055,6.4042964,2019-11-15,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of dementia. We estimated the potential impact of trends in diabetes prevalence upon mortality and the future burden of dementia and disability in England and Wales. METHODS: We used a probabilistic multi-state, open cohort Markov model to integrate observed trends in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia to forecast the occurrence of disability and dementia up to the year 2060. Model input data were taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Office for National Statistics vital data and published effect estimates for health-state transition probabilities. The baseline scenario corresponded to recent trends in obesity: a 26% increase in the number of people with diabetes by 2060. This scenario was evaluated against three alternative projected trends in diabetes: increases of 49%, 20% and 7%. RESULTS: Our results suggest that changes in the trend in diabetes prevalence will lead to changes in mortality and incidence of dementia and disability, which will become visible after 10–15 years. If the relative prevalence of diabetes increases 49% by 2060, expected additional deaths would be approximately 255,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 236,000–272,200), with 85,900 (71,500–101,600) cumulative additional cases of dementia and 104,900 (85,900–125,400) additional cases of disability. With a smaller relative increase in diabetes prevalence (7% increase by 2060), we estimated 222,200 (205,700–237,300) fewer deaths, and 77,000 (64,300–90,800) and 93,300 (76,700–111,400) fewer additional cases of dementia and disability, respectively, than the baseline case of a 26% increase in diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Reducing the burden of diabetes could result in substantial reductions in the incidence of dementia and disability over the medium to long term.

Between July 2005 and September 2015, 179 patients underwent surgical treatment for active LSNIE at a single institution. Patients were classified into two groups: ≥65 years (elderly group) and <65 years (non-elderly group). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and three-year survival rates were compared. The average ages were 74.2 ± 6.4 and 45.2 ± 12.6 years in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively. The elderly group had a higher predicted mortality rate and a lower incidence of preoperative septic emboli-related complications. Echocardiographic assessments of infected valves were generally homogenous between the groups. The elderly patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the non-elderly patients (26.3% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). For patients who survived to discharge, the three-year cumulative survival rates were 75.0% ± 8.2% and 81.2% ± 3.4% in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively (P = 0.484). In conclusion, elderly patients are at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality after surgery for LSNIE. However, once elderly patients are stabilized by surgical treatment and survive to discharge, the mid-term outcomes are promising.","Lin, Chun-Yu; Lu, Cheng-Hui; Lee, Hsiu-An; See, Lai-Chu; Wu, Meng-Yu; Han, Yi; Tseng, Chi-Nan; Su, I-Li; Li, Han-Yan; Tsai, Feng-Chun",Sci Rep,315,1

In order to identify useful competitor peptldes one must be able to assess peptide–MHC interactions. Several well described autoimmune disease models exist in the Lewis rat and thus this particular rat strain provides a good model system to study the effect of competitor peptldes. So far no information has been available on the peptide binding characteristics of the Lewis rat MHC class II RT1.B(I) molecule. We have now developed a biochemical binding assay which enables competition studies in which the relative MHC binding affinity of a set of non-labelled peptldes can be assessed while employing detection of blotlnylated marker peptides by chemllumlnescence. The assay is sensitive and specific. We have used this assay to determine the binding characteristics of several disease associated T cell determinants and their sequence analogues in the Lewis rat. Notably, most of the autoimmune disease associated peptide sequences tested were found to be intermediate to poor binders. Single amino acid substitutions at defined positions were sufficient to turn certain peptldes into good binders. These results are relevant to the design of competitor peptldes in the treatment of experimental autoimmune diseases.","Joosten, Irma; Wauben, Marca H.

The primary outcomes were the effects of GIK on two- and three-dimensional left ventricular ejection fraction (2D and 3D-LVEF), and on transmitral flow propagation velocity (Vp), that occurred between the pre- and post-CPB periods. GIK administration was associated with favorable interaction effects (p < 0.001) on 2D-LVEF, 3D-LVEF and Vp changes over the study periods. In GIK pretreated patients (N = 54), 2-D and 3D-LVEF and Vp increased slightly during surgery (mean difference [MD] + 3.5%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] − 0.2 to 7.1%, MD + 4.0%, 95% CI 0.6–7.4%, and MD + 22.2%, 95% CI 16.0–28.4%, respectively).

PURPOSE: The study was planned to develop a simple read out loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting a partial 18S rRNA gene of H. canis with naked eye visualisation of LAMP products. METHODS: A LAMP assay was employed to assess the DNA amplification by adding SYBR Green I dye for naked eye inspection of DNA accumulating in reaction tubes. Positive amplification was read through observation of change in colour of reaction mixture following addition of dye. The visual results were further verified with those of agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA of other haemoparasites of dog viz. Babesia vogeli, B. gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis and Trypanosoma evansi along with no-template control were used to determine the specificity of assay. RESULTS: Among the 109 blood samples presented at Small Animal Clinics, Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Punjab (India) tested, 39 revealed colour change from orange to green indicating positive reaction while 70 were negative as revealed by no colour change. The results of visual inspection were comparable to those obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP primers specifically amplified H. canis DNA, whereas no amplification was detected in DNA samples of other haemoparasites and no-template control revealing specificity of the assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of visual LAMP assay with respect to microscopy in detection of H. canis varied from 100% (15.81–100.00%) and 65.42% (55.61–74.35%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present investigation has developed a specific and rapid LAMP assay for the detection of H. canis, using SYBR Green I dye, which has practical applications for the screening of field samples.","Singh, Manraj Deep; Singh, Harkirat; Singh, Nirbhay Kumar; Singh, Niraj Kumar; Sood, Naresh Kumar; Rath, Shitanshu Shekar",Acta Parasitol,315,1

It has shown a rapid onset of pain relief in clinical trials. This study examines the use of Instanyl® in real-life settings. METHODS: A 3-month observational, prospective, cohort study of cancer patients with BTP receiving Instanyl® (50, 100, or 200 μg) under routine clinical practice. Data were collected at three time points corresponding with routine clinic visits – baseline, Week 4, and Week 13. Primary outcomes: success of titration and maintenance dose after titration. Secondary outcomes: change in maintenance dose of Instanyl® and level of background pain medication; Brief Pain Inventory—Short Form (BPI-SF) and Patient Treatment Satisfaction Scale (PTSS) scores; adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: Titration with Instanyl® was successful in 84.5 % of 309 patients; most patients were titrated at the lowest dose (50 μg). The majority showed no change in maintenance dose, with little change in the level of background pain medication. BPI-SF and PTSS scores significantly improved from baseline to Week 4. The main reason for terminating Instanyl® was death, as expected due to the underlying disease; incidence of ADRs was low and no fatal ADRs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-life group of cancer patients with disease progression, Instanyl® was titrated successfully at doses <200 μg in the majority of patients, requiring only one dose, with no further change in maintenance dose. Pain severity, impact of pain on daily life, and treatment satisfaction significantly improved with Instanyl® treatment.

Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with accurate mathematical models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we account for a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host by introducing a new mathematical model for disease transmission among three species. We present a model of these disease dynamics, including the equilibria of the system and the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, finding that in the presence of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease with the capacity to mutate in an intermediate host population can establish itself in humans even if its R(0) in humans is less than 1. This result and model can be used to predict the behavior of any zoonosis with an intermediate host and assist efforts to protect public health.","Royce, Katherine; Fu, Feng",PLoS One,315,1

Podoplanin, one of the podocyte-associated molecules, is closely related to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. A number of studies demonstrate that berberine could ameliorate renal dysfunction in diabetic mice with nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the relationship between the renoprotective effect of berberine and podoplanin expression in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice as well as mouse podocytes (MPC5 cells) cultured in high glucose (HG, 30 mM) medium. We found that the expression levels of podoplanin were significantly decreased both in the renal glomerulus of STZ-induced diabetic mice and HG-cultured MPC5 cells. We also demonstrated that NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in MPC5 cells under HG condition, which downregulated the expression level of podoplanin, thus leading to increased podocyte apoptosis. Administration of berberine (100, 200 mg/kg every day, ig, for 8 weeks) significantly improved hyperglycemia and the renal function of STZ-induced diabetic mice and restored the expression level of podoplanin in renal glomerulus. In high glucose-cultured MPC5 cells, treatment with berberine (30–120 μM) dose-dependently decreased the apoptosis rate, increased the expression of podoplanin, and inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. When podoplanin expression was silenced with shRNA, berberine treatment still inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway, but its antiapoptotic effect on podocytes almost disappeared. Our results suggest that berberine inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, thus increasing the podoplanin expression to exert renoprotective effects.","Yu, Jing; Zong, Guan-nan; Wu, Hao; Zhang, Ke-qin",Acta Pharmacol Sin,315,1

Here, we suggest that antibody assays developed in veterinary and clinical immunology and epidemiology provide excellent tools—or at least excellent starting points for development of tools—for tests of such hypotheses. We review how such assays work and how they may be optimized for new questions and new systems in eco-immunology. We provide examples of the application of such tools to eco-immunological studies of seabirds and mammals, and suggest a decision-tree to aid development of assays.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) could be effective for treating at-level spinal cord injury (SCI) pain. SETTING: Outpatient SCI clinic, New York, USA. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo or BoNTA with follow-up (office visit, telephone, or e-mail) at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks to assess the magnitude of pain relief post injection. Crossover of participants was then performed. Those who received placebo received BoNTA, and vice versa, with follow-up at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Eight participants completed at least one of the two crossover study arms. Four completed both arms. The median age of the eight participants was 45 years (range 32–61 years) and 75% were male. All had traumatic, T1-L3 level, complete SCI. Although our data did not meet statistical significance, we noted a higher proportion of participants reporting a marked change in average pain intensity from baseline to 8 and 12 weeks post-BoNTA vs. post-placebo (33% vs. 0%). At 2 and 4 weeks post-BoNTA, almost all participants reported some degree of reduced pain, while the same was not seen post-placebo (83% vs. 0%). CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous injection of BoNTA may be a feasible approach for the control of at-level SCI pain and is worthy of further study.

The majority of reports focus on the presence of viral DNA ignoring proof of viral RNAs as important markers for viral activity. During this study, we established (RT-) qPCR to characterize expression of B19V RNAs (NS1 and VP1/2) in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of 576 patients with unexplained heart failure. 403/576 (70%) EMBs were positive for B19V DNA. B19V mRNAs NS1 and/or VP1/2, indicating viral activity, could be detected in 38.5% of B19V DNA positive samples using the newly established B19V RT-PCRs. 22.1% of samples were characterized by only NS1 mRNA detection while 6.0% revealed only VP1/2 mRNA expression. Detection of both intermediates was successful in 10.4% of samples. Applying the molecular testing, our study revealed that a high proportion (38.5%) of B19V DNA positive EMBs was characterized by viral transcriptional activity. Further prospective studies will evaluate relevance of viral transcription intermediates as a diagnostic marker to differentiate between latent B19V infection and clinically relevant transcriptionally active B19V-infection of the heart muscle.","Pietsch, Heiko; Escher, Felicitas; Aleshcheva, Ganna; Lassner, Dirk; Bock, Claus-Thomas; Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter",Sci Rep,315,19

In an effort to find antiviral medications, many computational groups have pursued the 3C-like protease of the virus, also known as main protease (M(pro)), as a drug target. We have identified experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against closely related (96% sequence identity, 100% active site conservation) protease of SARS-CoV and employed this data to build Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models for this dataset. We employed these models for virtual screening of all marketed, withdrawn, experimental, and investigational drugs from DrugBank, including compounds in clinical trials. Molecular docking and similarity search approaches were explored in parallel with QSAR modeling, but molecular docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so we did not rely on this approach in prospective virtual screening. As a result of our studies, we recommended 41 approved, experimental, or investigational drugs as potential agents against SARS-CoV-2 acting as putative inhibitors of M(pro)>. Ten compounds with feasible prices were purchased and are awaiting the experimental validation. This manuscript will be updated once results are available and submitted for peer-review publication if compounds are found to be active in SARS-CoV-2 phenotypic screen.","Bobrowski, Tesia; Alves, Vinicius M.; Melo-Filho, Cleber C.; Korn, Daniel; Auerbach, Scott; Schmitt, Charles; Muratov, Eugene N.; Tropsha, Alexander",ChemRxiv,315,1

The enrolment of nutraceutical anti-herpesvirus drugs in clinical investigations with promising levels of reduced resistance, free or minimal cellular toxicity, and diverse mechanisms of action might be an effective way to defeat challenges that hurdle the progress of anti-herpesvirus drug development, including the problems with drug resistance and recurrent infections. Therefore, in this review, we aim to hunt down all investigations that feature the curative properties of curcumin, a principal bioactive phenolic compound of the spice turmeric, in regard to various human and animal herpesvirus infections and inflammation connected with these diseases. Curcumin was explored with potent antiherpetic actions against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, human cytomegalovirus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, Epstein–Barr virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, and pseudorabies virus. The mechanisms and pathways by which curcumin inhibits anti-herpesvirus activities by targeting multiple steps in herpesvirus life/infectious cycle are emphasized. Improved strategies to overcome bioavailability challenges that limit its use in clinical practice, along with approaches and new directions to enhance the anti-herpesvirus efficacy of this compound, are also reviewed. According to the reviewed studies, this paper presents curcumin as a promising natural drug for the prevention and treatment of herpesvirus infections and their associated inflammatory diseases.","Šudomová, Miroslava; Hassan, Sherif T.

When estimating ODE parameters from noisy data, a common distribution assumption is using the Gaussian distribution. It is known that the Gaussian distribution is not robust when abnormal data exist. In this article, we develop a hierarchical semiparametric mixed-effects ODE model for longitudinal data under the Bayesian framework. For robust inference on ODE parameters, we consider a class of heavy-tailed distributions to model the random effects of ODE parameters and observations errors. An MCMC method is proposed to sample ODE parameters from the posterior distributions. Our proposed method is illustrated by studying a gene regulation experiment. Simulation studies show that our proposed method provides satisfactory results for the semiparametric mixed-effects ODE models with finite samples.

Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) generates antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Coding SNPs in ERAP1 have been associated with predisposition to inflammatory rheumatic disease and shown to affect functional properties of the enzyme, but the interplay between combinations of these SNPs as they exist in allotypes has not been thoroughly explored. We used phased genotype data to estimate ERAP1 allotype frequency in 2504 individuals across five major human populations, generated highly pure recombinant enzymes corresponding to the ten most common ERAP1 allotypes, and systematically characterized their in vitro enzymatic properties. We find that ERAP1 allotypes possess a wide range of enzymatic activities, up to 60-fold, whose ranking is substrate dependent. Strikingly, allotype 10, previously associated with Behçet’s disease, is consistently a low-activity outlier, suggesting that a significant percentage of individuals carry a subactive ERAP1 gene. Enzymatic analysis revealed that ERAP1 allotypes can differ in both catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity, differences that can change intermediate accumulation in multistep trimming reactions. Alterations in efficacy of an allosteric inhibitor that targets the regulatory site suggest that allotypic variation influences the communication between the regulatory and the active site. Our work defines the wide landscape of ERAP1 activity in human populations and demonstrates how common allotypes can induce substrate-dependent variability in antigen processing, thus contributing, in synergy with major histocompatibility complex haplotypes, to immune response variability and predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions.","Hutchinson, Jonathan P.; Temponeras, Ioannis; Kuiper, Jonas; Cortes, Adrian; Korczynska, Justyna; Kitchen, Semra; Stratikos, Efstratios",J Biol Chem,315,12

Generally, SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections are more sensitive than sensors with circular or square cross-sections. Two main reasons are discussed in this article. Firstly, SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections have the largest surface-to-volume ratio and depletion ratio which significantly enhance the sensors’ sensitivity. Secondly, the manufacturing processes of the electron beam lithography (EBL) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods seriously affect the surface state and lattice quality, which eventually influence SiNWs-FET sensors’ sensitivity. In contrast, wet etching and thermal oxidation (WETO) create fewer surface defects and higher quality lattices. Furthermore, the software simulation confirms that SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections have better sensitivity than the other two types of SiNWs-FET sensors under the same conditions, consistent with the theoretical analysis. The article fully proved that SiNWs-FET sensors fabricated by the WETO method produced the best sensitivity and it will be widely used in the future.","Yang, Yi; Lu, Zicheng; Liu, Duo; Wang, Yuelin; Chen, Shixing; Li, Tie",Biosensors (Basel),315,1

The primary endpoint was incident anxiety as identified by ICD-9 coding. Results: This study included 48,023 (50% males) patients with a median follow-up of 224 [interquartile range (IQR): 217–229] months. Females were more likely to develop incident anxiety compared to males (incidence rate: 7 vs. 2%), as were patients of older age. Significant univariate predictors were female gender, older age, preexisting cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and gastrointestinal diseases, various laboratory examinations, and the number of blood pressure measurements. Higher baseline, maximum, minimum, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and variability score of diastolic blood pressure significantly predicted incident anxiety, as did all systolic blood pressure measures [baseline, latest, maximum, minimum, mean, median, variance, SD, root mean square (RMS), CV, and variability score]. Conclusions: The relationships between longer-term visit-to-visit BPV and incident anxiety were identified.

Although IBS does not develop into a serious disease or increase mortality, it results in a considerable reduction in the quality of life. The etiology of IBS is not known, but the intestinal microbiota appears to play a pivotal role in its pathophysiology. There is no effective treatment for IBS, and so the applied treatments clinically focus on symptom relief. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), an old Chinese treatment, has been applied to IBS patients in seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Positive effects on IBS symptoms in various degrees were obtained in four of these RCTs, while there was no effect in the remaining three. Across the seven RCTs there were marked differences in the selection processes for the donor and treated patients, the transplant dose, the route of administration, and the methods used to measure how the patients responded to FMT. The present frontier discusses these differences and proposes: (1) criteria for selecting an effective donor (superdonor); (2) selection criteria for patients that are suitable for FMT; (3) the optimal FMT dose; and (4) the route of transplant administration. FMT appears to be safe, with only mild, self-limiting side effects of abdominal pain, cramping, tenderness, diarrhea, and constipation. Although it is early to speculate about the mechanisms underlying the effects of FMT, the available data suggest that changes in the intestinal bacteria accompanied by changes in fermentation patterns and fermentation products (specifically short-chain fatty acids) play an important role in improving the IBS symptoms seen after FMT. FMT appears to be a promising treatment for IBS, but further studies are needed before it can be applied in everyday clinical practice.","El-Salhy, Magdy; Patcharatrakul, Tanisa; Gonlachanvit, Sutep",World J Gastroenterol,315,1

Statistical results and experts’ report indicate a strong association between severe weight-loss in HD at the premanifest stage and measures of certain cognitive, psychiatric functional ability factors. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying weight-loss in HD is, at least partly related to dysfunction of certain areas of the brain, a finding that may have not been apparent otherwise.

Proprioceptive training programs in the form of kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) exercises have been reported to be beneficial for individuals with knee OA. However, the most optimal training dosage of KBA exercises is still unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of different frequencies of KBA training (i.e., twice-weekly or thrice-weekly) in adults with knee OA. METHODS: A single (assessor) blind, three-arm parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred twenty adults with knee OA will be recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Northwestern Nigeria and randomly assigned into one of three intervention groups; twice-weekly KBA (n = 40), thrice-weekly KBA (n = 40), and conventional physiotherapy (n = 40) in the ratio of 1:1:1. Participants in the conventional physiotherapy group will receive two sessions of brief patient education, and sixteen sessions of ultrasound therapy, and stretching and strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. Participants in the two different KBA groups will receive KBA training according to the designed sessions for 8 weeks in addition to the conventional physiotherapy program. All groups will be assessed pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and at 3 months, 4 months, and 6 months post-randomization.

Yet, decisions for if, when, how, and for whom GBL should be designed cannot be made on a solid empirical basis. Though the act of play seems to be intertwined with GBL, it is generally ignored in the current scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to explore students’ perceptions of play in leisure time and of GBL as part of a mechanistic, bottom-up approach towards evidence-informed design and implementation of GBL in health profession education. METHODS: We conducted 6 focus group discussions with medical and dentistry students, which were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 58 students participated. We identified 4 major themes based on the students’ perception of play in leisure time and on the combination of play and learning. Our results indicate that, while play preferences were highly various in our health profession student cohort, pleasure was the common ground reported for playing. Crucially, play and the serious act of learning seemed paradoxical, indicating that the value and meaning of play are strongly context-dependent for students. CONCLUSIONS: Four key points can be constructed from our study. First, students play for pleasure. Perceptions of pleasure vary considerably among students. Second, students consider play as inefficient. Inefficiency will only be justified when it increases learning. Third, play should be balanced with the serious and only be used for difficult or tedious courses. Fourth, GBL activities should not be made compulsory for students. We provide practical implications and directions for future research.","Van Gaalen, A E J; Jaarsma, A D C; Georgiadis, J R",JMIR Serious Games,315,1

Methods: This is an ecological study of trends in three periods of time: two before (2000–2003 and 2004–2008), and one after (2009–2014) the onset of the economic crisis. The units of analysis were the geographical areas of nine cities or urban areas in Europe. We analysed chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis standardised mortality ratios, smoothing them with a hierarchical Bayesian model by each city, area, and sex. An ecological regression model was fitted to analyse the trends in socioeconomic inequalities, and included the socioeconomic deprivation index, the period, and their interaction. Results: In general, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis mortality rates were higher in men than in women. These rates decreased in all cities during the financial crisis, except among men in Athens (rates increased from 8.50 per 100,000 inhabitants during the second period to 9.42 during the third). Socioeconomic inequalities in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis mortality were found in six cities/metropolitan areas among men, and in four among women. Finally, in the periods studied, such inequalities did not significantly change. However, among men they increased in Turin and Barcelona and among women, several cities had lower inequalities in the third period. Conclusions: There are geographical socioeconomic inequalities in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis mortality, mainly among men, that did not change during the 2008 financial crisis. These results should be monitored in the long term.","Borrell, Carme; Palència, Laia; Bosakova, Lucia; Gotsens, Mercè; Morrison, Joana; Costa, Claudia; Dzurova, Dagmar; Deboosere, Patrick; Lustigova, Michala; Marí-Dell’Olmo, Marc; Rodopoulou, Sophia; Santana, Paula",Int J Environ Res Public Health,315,33

These cells form the air-blood interface and secrete surfactant, respectively, and are essential for lung maturation and function. Current protocols to derive and culture alveolar cells do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture of the distal lung, which influences cell fate patterns in vivo. Here, we report serum-free conditions that allow for growth and differentiation of mouse distal lung epithelial progenitors. We find that Collagen I promotes the differentiation of flattened, polarized AT1 cells. Using these organoids, we performed a chemical screen to investigate WNT signaling in epithelial differentiation. We identify an association between Casein Kinase activity and maintenance of an AT2 expression signature; Casein Kinase inhibition leads to an increase in AT1/progenitor cell ratio. These organoids provide a simplified model of alveolar differentiation and constitute a scalable screening platform to identify and analyze cell differentiation mechanisms.","Gkatzis, Konstantinos; Panza, Paolo; Peruzzo, Sofia; Stainier, Didier YR",,315,1

Identifying highly developable mAb sequences in silico could greatly reduce the time and cost required for therapeutic mAb development. Here, we present position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for antibody framework mutations developed using baseline human antibody repertoire sequences. Our analysis shows that human antibody repertoire-based PSSMs are consistent across individuals and demonstrate high correlations between related germlines. We show that mutations in existing therapeutic antibodies can be accurately predicted solely from baseline human antibody sequence data. We find that mAbs developed using humanized mice had more human-like FR mutations than mAbs originally developed by hybridoma technology. A quantitative assessment of entire framework regions of therapeutic antibodies revealed that there may be potential for improving the properties of existing therapeutic antibodies by incorporating additional mutations of high frequency in baseline human antibody repertoires. In addition, high frequency mutations in baseline human antibody repertoires were predicted in silico to reduce immunogenicity in therapeutic mAbs due to the removal of T cell epitopes. Several therapeutic mAbs were identified to have common, universally high-scoring framework mutations, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanistic basis for the evolutionary selection of these mutations. Our results suggest that baseline human antibody repertoires may be useful as predictive tools to guide mAb development in the future.","Petersen, Brian M.; Ulmer, Sophia A.; Rhodes, Emily R.; Gutierrez-Gonzalez, Matias F.; Dekosky, Brandon J.; Sprenger, Kayla G.; Whitehead, Timothy A.",Front Immunol,315,16

The best available evidence suggests that HIV newly infected the human species about 50–100 years ago (Korber et al., 2000). It did not originate in Asia. It apparently moved to people from sub-human primates in Africa (Keele et al., 2006; Kanki, 1997). Because of different clinical presentations in different populations of people, and a long incubation period, it was more difficult to diagnose than SARS or avian influenza. As a new epidemic that originated in the era of modern medicine, it taught us many lessons about the difficulties that a new infectious disease can present. Already claiming at least 60–80 million victims, AIDS seems destined to continue as a pandemic for the foreseeable future. Drugs that control HIV replication and reverse disease progression have been developed, but none eliminate the virus from the body. Sexual transmission can be prevented by abstinence or condoms, but such measures, which prevent procreation, provide only limited value. Approaches for making a vaccine using conventional techniques have failed. Most experts believe that an effective vaccine will be made eventually, but not for at least 10–20 years. We need to learn more about the immunobiology of acute HIV infection, and about potentially protective immunoepitopes, such as conformational intermediates of the virus envelope. Until a vaccine is available, there is little or no chance that HIV can be eliminated, or even drastically reduced in prevalence. AIDS has presented scientists, political leaders, and health policy experts with unprecedented challenges.","Essex, M.; Lu, Yichen",Emerging Infections in Asia,315,1

Many of these similarities serve no logical purpose but have a descriptive or explanatory function in our cognitive affairs. However, for the substantial number of analogies which are used in argument, their logical and other attributes have long been a source of fascination for investigators in a range of disciplines. It is argued in this chapter that cognitive agents use the argument from analogy as a facilitative heuristic to guide their judgements about public health problems when evidence or knowledge is not available in a particular context. To this extent, the argument is one type of adaptation of our rational procedures to the problem of uncertainty in the cognitive domain. Several examples of the use of this argument in a public health context are examined. The dialectical and epistemic features of this argument are addressed within a discussion of the use of analogical argument in systematic and heuristic reasoning. The results of a study of public health reasoning reveal that members of the public are adept at identifying the conditions under which the use of analogical argument is more or less rationally warranted.","Cummings, Louise",Reasoning and Public Health: New Ways of Coping with Uncertainty,315,1

To develop a self-adaptive information system, information system engineers have to create self-adaptation logic that encodes when and how the system should adapt itself. However, developing self-adaptation logic may be difficult due to design time uncertainty; e.g., anticipating all potential environment changes at design time is in most cases infeasible. Online reinforcement learning (RL) addresses design time uncertainty by learning the effectiveness of adaptation actions through interactions with the system’s environment at run time, thereby automating the development of self-adaptation logic. Existing online RL approaches for self-adaptive information systems exhibit two shortcomings that limit the degree of automation: they require manually fine-tuning the exploration rate and may require manually quantizing environment states to foster scalability. We introduce an approach to automate the aforementioned manual activities by employing policy-based RL as a fundamentally different type of RL. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our approach using two self-adaptive information system exemplars.","Palm, Alexander; Metzger, Andreas; Pohl, Klaus",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,315,12

There are forecasts that there will be an exponential increase in the number of such deaths across the globe because of this deadly virus. To arrest the spread of the virus in this situation, the supply of medical materials including PPE and body bags (also known as human remains pouch or cadaver bag) should be designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Conventional body bags have shortcomings, which need to be addressed by a refined redesigning and use of appropriate materials to adequately match the requirements in the current Covid-19 situation. Current designs of the body bags do not allow the family member’s sentiments towards the deceased and to cater to the desire of the family members to view the face of the deceased without exposing them to a strong possibility of infection from the cadaver. This is, therefore, a very traumatic experience to the family and in many cases, the cadaver is not handled with respect due to the unavailability of safe design body bags, which also exposes health workers to avoidable risk from the infections.

The toxicity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has become one of the major challenges that limits the wider use of CAR T cells to fight cancer. Exploration of CRS pathogenesis and treatment is becoming the main focus of ongoing studies. Myeloid-derived macrophages were found to play a critical role in CRS pathogenesis, and these cells mediate the major production of core cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1 and interferon (IFN)-γ. Colocalization of macrophages and CAR T cells was also identified as necessary for inducing CRS, and CD40L-CD40 signaling might be the key cell–cell interaction in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages might also take part in endocrine and self-amplified catecholamine loops that can directly activate cytokine production and release by macrophages during CRS. In addition to tocilizumab and corticosteroids, several novel CRS therapies targeting macrophage-centered pathways have shown much potential, including GM-CSF blockade and administration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and α-methyltyrosine (metyrosine, MTR).

In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica, causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis since the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shuja, Junaid; Alanazi, Eisa; Alasmary, Waleed; Alashaikh, Abdulaziz",Appl Intell,315,1

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to improve the psychological health outcomes of HCPs. To date, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have primarily focused upon empirical investigations into the reduction of stress amongst HCPs using MBSR and are limited to empirical studies published before December 2019. This systematic review aimed to update the current evidence base and broaden our understanding of the effectiveness of MBSR on improving the psychological functioning of HCPs. METHODS: Three electronic databases (Medline, Psych Info and Web of Science) were searched without time frame restrictions. Quantitative studies included randomised controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, pre-post designs and studies with up to a 12-month follow-up period. All studies included in the review employed a MBSR programme, standardised measures of psychological functioning and qualified HCPs as participants. RESULTS: Using PRISMA guidelines thirty studies were included in the review. The reviewed literature suggested that MBSR was effective in reducing HCPs experiences of anxiety, depression and stress. MBSR was also found to be effective in increasing HCP levels of mindfulness and self-compassion. However, MBSR did not appear as effective in reducing burnout or improving resilience amongst HCPs. Abbreviated MBSR programmes were found to be as effective as the traditional 8-week MBSR programmes. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR is an effective intervention which can help improve the psychological functioning of HCPs. Recommendations include improving the overall quality of the studies by employing more robust controlled designs with randomisation, increased sample sizes with heterogeneous samples, and making active comparisons between interventions used.","Kriakous, Sarah Angela; Elliott, Katie Ann; Lamers, Carolien; Owen, Robin",Mindfulness (N Y),315,1

Among its advantages are its speed in decision making and the opportunity for rapid, actionable deduction from unstructured data with that increases with access to larger volumes of data. Artificial intelligence algorithms are currently being applied to enable faster prognosis and diagnosis of diseases and to improve patient outcomes.(1,2) Despite the successful application of artificial intelligence, it is still fraught with limitations and “unknowns” pertaining to the fact that a model's accuracy is dependent on the amount of information available for training the model, and the understanding of the complexity presented by current artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is often limited in many individuals outside of those involved in the field. This paper reviews the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to acute care research and highlights commonly used machine learning techniques, limitations, and potential future applications.","Ohu, Ikechukwu; Benny, Paul Kummannoor; Rodrigues, Steven; Carlson, Jestin N.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,315,16

As dog ownership spirals upwards in the United States, it is important to continue to monitor the epidemiology of dog bite injuries. This study provides contemporary data on the incidence of dog bites injuries in the United States and in New York and profiles individuals who have been treated for dog bites in emergency departments. The study also examines the demographic correlates of the rate of injuries at the neighborhood level in New York City and maps the rate in each neighborhood. METHODS: At the national level, the study examines longitudinal data on dog bite injuries from 2005 to 2018 gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For New York, the study analyzes data for 2005–2018 collected by the New York State Department of Health. A negative binomial regression analysis was performed on the state data to measure the simultaneous effects of demographic variables on the incidence of dog-related injuries. A thematically shaded map of the rate of dog bite injuries in New York City’s neighborhoods was created to identify neighborhoods with higher-than-average concentration of injuries. RESULTS: In both the United States and New York the rate of dog-bite injuries increased from 2005 to 2011 and then underwent a significant decline. Injuries due to dog bites, however, still remain a sizable public health problem. Injuries are more prevalent among school-age children, inhabitants of less-densely populated areas, and residents of poorer neighborhoods. In New York City, poorer neighborhoods are also associated with fewer dogs being spayed or neutered. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the rate of dog bite injuries, prevention programs – particularly those which center on teaching the dangers of canine interactions with humans – should be targeted at children. Dog bite injuries tend to be clustered in identifiable neighborhoods. Dog bite prevention programs and stricter enforcement of dog laws can target these neighborhoods.","Tuckel, Peter S.; Milczarski, William",Inj Epidemiol,315,1

The transportation sector is particularly affected by the pandemic situation. The current study aims to contribute to the empirical knowledge regarding the effects of the coronavirus situation on the mobility of people by (1) broadening the perspective to the mobility rural area’s residents and (2) providing subjective data concerning the perceived changes of affected persons’ mobility practices, as these two aspects have scarcely been considered in research so far. METHODS: To address these research gaps, a mixed-methods study was conducted that integrates a qualitative telephone interview study (N = 15) and a quantitative household survey (N = 301). The rural district of Altmarkkreis Salzwedel in Northern Germany was chosen as a model region. RESULTS: The results provide in-depth insights into the changing mobility practices of residents of a rural area during the legal restrictions to stem the spread of the virus. A high share of respondents (62.6%) experienced no changes in their mobility behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. However, nearly one third of trips were also cancelled overall. A modal shift was observed towards the reduction of trips by car and bus, and an increase of trips by bike. The share of trips by foot was unchanged. The majority of respondents did not predict strong long-term effects of the corona pandemic on their mobility behavior.","König, Alexandra; Dreßler, Annika",Eur,315,16

Three separate studies were conducted with community-dwelling adults (N = 1685) in the USA. In Study 1, we drafted, tested, and modified vignettes with reference to pilot data on the relevance of the scenarios and response options. In Study 2, regulatory flexibility of sustaining daily routines, as calculated in term of context sensitivity and responsiveness to feedback, was formulated correlations with self-reported instruments to demonstrate its concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. In Study 3, path analysis examined the associations of regulatory flexibility of sustaining daily routines with psychological distress and well-being, and the moderating effects of subjective financial strain on the associations. Results showed that the inverse associations of context sensitivity and responsiveness to feedback with depressive symptoms were stronger at medium/high levels relative to lower levels of perceived financial strain. The inverse association between context sensitivity and positive affect was significant only at higher levels of strain. Our findings could provide a feasible direction for developing scalable behavioral interventions for potential mental health problems, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status.","Hou, Wai Kai; Liang, Li; Hougen, Clint; Bonanno, George A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,315,1

However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may lead to sub-optimal preparations. The current commentary provides the following evidence-based recommendations for the Olympic preparations: make sure to have extensive experience of training (> 60 days annually) and competition at or above the altitude of competition (~ 1700 m), to optimize and individualize your strategies for acclimatization and competition. In preparing for the Olympics, 10–14 days at ~ 1700 m seems to optimize performance at this altitude effectively. An alternative strategy involves two–three weeks of training at > 2000 m, followed by 7–10 days of tapering off at ~ 1700 m. During each of the last 3 or 4 days prior to departure, shift your sleeping and eating schedule by 0.5–1 h towards the time zone in Beijing. In addition, we recommend that you arrive in Beijing one day earlier for each hour change in time zone, followed by appropriate timing of exposure to daylight, meals, social contacts, and naps, in combination with a gradual increase in training load. Optimize your own individual procedures for warming-up, as well as for maintaining body temperature during the period between the warm-up and competition, effective treatment of asthma (if necessary) and pacing at ~ 1700 m with cold ambient temperatures. Although we hope that these recommendations will be helpful in preparing for the Beijing Olympics in 2022, there is a clear need for more solid evidence gained through new sophisticated experiments and observational studies.","Sandbakk, Øyvind; Solli, Guro Strøm; Talsnes, Rune Kjøsen; Holmberg, Hans-Christer",J,315,1

The types of artifact that could be used are as follows: (a) streaking, which is commonly due to a discrepancy in a single measurement, (b) shading, which is due to a group of channels deviating gradually from the true measurement, (c) rings, which are due to errors in individual detector calibration and (d) distortion, which is due to helical reconstruction. It is occasionally possible to avoid scanning of a bony area, by means of changing the postion of the patient. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the common artifacts that affect image quality and the method of correction to improve image quality. RESULTS: The data were collected by distributing a questionnaire to the CT technologist at different hospitals about the most common type of artifacts in the CT images, source of artifacts and methods of correction. A total of 95 CT technologists responded to the questionnaire, which included 67% males and 33% females. Most of the participants (70%) were experienced CT technologists, and 61% of the participants had not done any subspecialty CT scan courses. The most common artifact used in the CT departments was motion artifact in brain CT (73%), and the best method to reduce motion artifact was patient preparation (87%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common shown artifact in this study was motion artifact, and the common cause was the patient-based artifact. It is important to understand why objects occur and how they could be prevented or suppressed to improve image quality.","Alzain, Amel F.; Elhussein, Nagwan; Fadulelmulla, Ibtisam Abdallah; Ahmed, Amna Mohamed; Elbashir, M.

This sudden suspension of sports, physical activity and peer/social interaction may have negative implications on adolescent anxiety and fatigue, as well as peer relationships and sleep quality. PURPOSE: (1) Compare quality of life and sleep quality measures in adolescent athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic to measures obtained 1-2 years earlier. (2) Assess physical activity and social interaction behavior during the two weeks prior to school closure compared to a two-week period during school closure. METHODS: Participants first completed Patient Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS) anxiety, fatigue, and peer relationship short forms, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) during pre-participation sport physical evaluations (May 2018 or 2019), and again during May or June (2020). Physical activity and social interaction were assessed at the second timepoint by asking participants to retrospectively report behaviors during the two weeks prior to school closure, and during the two weeks preceding questionnaire completion. We compared outcomes using paired samples t-tests (continuous outcome variables) and McNemar’s test (categorical outcome variables). All statistical tests were two-sided and evaluated at a significance level of α = 0.05. RESULTS: A significant portion (92%) of participants (n=39; 16.2±0.9 years of age; 64% female; 499±177 days between assessments) reported sport cessation due to COVID-19 (Table 1). Compared to pre-COVID assessments, participants reported significantly higher anxiety and fatigue scores, and significantly worse sleep quality after school and sport cessation (Figure 1). Physical activity frequency and duration were significantly reduced in the two weeks prior to questionnaire completion compared to the two weeks before sport and school closure (Table 2). No significant difference was found for quality of peer relationships (Figure 1), although characteristics of peer/social interactions differed significantly between timepoints. CONCLUSION: Following recent stay-at-home orders, high school athletes reported more anxiety and fatigue, worse sleep quality, and less physical activity compared to assessments obtained in the Spring of 2018 or 2019. The abrupt cessation of school and sport participation due to COVID-19, in combination with other life factors, likely contributed to reductions in physical activity, worse sleep quality, changes in social interaction, elevated levels of anxiety, and increased fatigue among high school athletes.

This study also analyzes the factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome and duration of hospital stay among the patients. Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study carried out in the Pulmonology Ward of the Bahawal Victoria hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. All patients with empyema thoracis registered at the study site during the period of 1 year were included in the study. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the factors associated with duration of hospital stay and unsuccessful treatment outcome among the patients. Results: A total 110 patients were included in the study. Most of the patients (n = 73, 66.4%) were treated with piperacillin/tazobactam alone and in combination with either one or more than one antibiotics as an empiric therapy. Culture was positive in 58 (52.7%) patients and the most commonly identified organisms included, gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 20; 18.8%) and Klebsiella sp. (n = 11, 10%) followed by same proportion of E. coli. The most commonly identified bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against antibiotics used as an empiric therapy, while these showed low level of resistance against amoxicillin, clarithromycin, ertapenem, colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, and vancomycin. In this study, 82 (74.5%) patients successfully completed the treatment, while 12 (11%) showed no clinical improvement, 5 (4.5%) lost to follow up and 11 (10%) died. In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, none of the patient attributes were significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome, while in multivariate linear regression analysis, the factors which were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay included; duration of symptoms <2 weeks prior to admission (p = 0.008, beta = −0.247) and resistance to five antibiotic classes (p = 0.02, beta = 0.280). Conclusion: Close to 25% of the patients did not complete the treatment successfully. Most of the common bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the broad-spectrum antibiotics used as an empiric therapy. This is alarming. However, better sensitivity of common bacterial isolates against standardized first line treatment for empyema thoracis is promising.","Atif, Muhammad; Naseem, Mehwish; Sarwar, Sajjad; Mukhtar, Saba; Malik, Iram; Hassan, Muhammad Rauf ul; Iqbal, Muhammad Nouman; Ahmad, Nafees",Front Med (Lausanne),315,1

The experience gained over the past years and decades in e‑learning and blended learning by higher education institutions is helpful, but in most cases still insufficient for the purely digital teaching that is now required. During the winter term 2020/2021, the University of Münster and the South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences held an online course on “Fundamentals of Business Process Management” as part of their respective bachelor’s degree programmes in Wirtschaftsinformatik (Information Systems). The lecture served as preparation for an international Winter School on the topic of the same name. The content was based on a recognised textbook. For the online lecture, corresponding video material prepared by the authors of the textbook and curated by the lecturers was used. While regular virtual feedback rounds (video conferences) were offered at the University of Applied Sciences to answer potential questions of the students, the course at the university was designed as purely online.

Within the region, the survival of small states can no longer be taken for granted and power relations are conflictual. The hegemonic ambitions of larger regional state actors draw small states into a contested orbit and emphasize the fluidity of pre-existing notions of the balance of power. This has led to forms of fragmentation. Small states can no longer sit comfortably under the shelter of regional and even external super-powers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small states like Kuwait and Qatar is a useful prism to examine the ways in which such small states attempt to project power and sovereignty through their diplomatic responses. Our argument, here, is that such discourse is framed as part of an ideational and material construct for state resilience within a regional and international system that is perceived as predatory. Yet pandemic politics reveals both the opportunities and limits of such approaches.","Milton-Edwards, Beverley",Int Polit,315,8

The recent pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2, is taking a heavy toll on society and planetary health, and illustrates the threat emerging coronaviruses can pose to the well-being of humans and other animals. Coronaviruses are constantly evolving, crossing host species barriers, and expanding their host range. In the last few decades, several novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans and domestic animals. Novel coronaviruses have also been discovered in captive wildlife or wild populations, raising conservation concerns. The evolution and emergence of novel viruses is enabled by frequent cross-species transmission. It is thus crucial to determine emerging coronaviruses' potential for infecting different host species, and to identify the circumstances under which cross-species transmission occurs in order to mitigate the rate of disease emergence. Here, I review (broadly across several mammalian host species) up-to-date knowledge of host range and circumstances concerning reported cross-species transmission events of emerging coronaviruses in humans and common domestic mammals. All of these coronaviruses had similar host ranges, were closely related (indicative of rapid diversification and spread), and their emergence was likely associated with high-host-density environments facilitating multi-species interactions (e.g., shelters, farms, and markets) and the health or well-being of animals as end- and/or intermediate spillover hosts. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms of the cross-species transmission events that have ultimately led to a surge of emerging coronaviruses in multiple species in a relatively short period of time in a world undergoing rapid environmental change.","Nova, Nicole",Front Public Health,315,1

We hypothesized that BAL increases the interstitial opacity of caudoventral and caudodorsal thoracic radiographs. Fifty-three horses, including 8 clinic owned and 45 from a referral hospital population, were classified as healthy controls (n = 12), severe equine asthma (recurrent airway obstruction, n = 12) or mild-to-moderate equine asthma (inflammatory airway disease, n = 21) based on the results of a clinical scoring system. Eight were excluded due to different diagnoses and poor image quality. Four randomized thoracic radiographs of each horse were scored by two blinded observers, who were also asked to identify the image as obtained before or after a BAL procedure. In severe equine asthma, the chance (adjusted odds) of misinterpretation of the correct imaging time was approximately 5 times higher than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 5.373, p = 0.028). The chance of misinterpretation was approximately 4 times lower in caudodorsal images than in caudoventral projections (OR = 0.241, p = 0.004). Identification of the correct imaging time was highly correlated with an increase in interstitial opacity (OR = 9.976, p ＜ 0.0001).

AIMS In preclinical experimental simulations, evaluate occupational and environmental safety of the newly developed isolation system for aerosol transmitted infections (ISATI). METHOD Simulations were conducted to test ISATI's capability to isolate aerosolized molecular (caffeine), and biological (SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA) markers. Caffeine deposition was analyzed on nitrocellulose sensor discs by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS ISATI demonstrated efficacy in isolating molecular and biological markers within the enclosed environment in simulated conditions of CPAP, HFNO and mechanical ventilation therapy. Neither the molecular marker nor substantial amounts of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the surrounding environment, outside ISATI, indicating appropriate occupational safety for healthcare professionals.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the canonical cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

Exacerbated production of cytokines, mainly IL-6, points to macrophages as key to understand differential COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 may modulate macrophage-mediated inflammation events by altering the balance between angiotensin II, which activates angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2, and angiotensin 1-7 and alamandine, which activate MAS proto-oncogene and MAS-related D receptors, respectively. In addition to macrophages, lung cells express RAS components; also, some lung cells are able to produce IL-6.

We used the JAK inhibitor baricitinib, with IFN-blocking activity in vitro, to ameliorate disease. METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2017, 10 patients with CANDLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures), 4 patients with SAVI (stimulator of IFN genes-associated [STING-associated] vasculopathy with onset in infancy), and 4 patients with other interferonopathies were enrolled in an expanded access program. The patients underwent dose escalation, and the benefit was assessed by reductions in daily disease symptoms and corticosteroid requirement. Quality of life, organ inflammation, changes in IFN-induced biomarkers, and safety were longitudinally assessed. RESULTS Eighteen patients were treated for a mean duration of 3.0 years (1.5-4.9 years). The median daily symptom score decreased from 1.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.93-1.78) to 0.25 (IQR, 0.1-0.63) (P < 0.0001). In 14 patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, daily prednisone doses decreased from 0.44 mg/kg/day (IQR, 0.31-1.09) to 0.11 mg/kg/day (IQR, 0.02-0.24) (P < 0.01), and 5 of 10 patients with CANDLE achieved lasting clinical remission. The patients' quality of life and height and bone mineral density Z-scores significantly improved, and their IFN biomarkers decreased. Three patients, two of whom had genetically undefined conditions, discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy, and one CANDLE patient discontinued treatment because of BK viremia and azotemia. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and BK viruria and viremia. CONCLUSION Upon baricitinib treatment, clinical manifestations and inflammatory and IFN biomarkers improved in patients with the monogenic interferonopathies CANDLE, SAVI, and other interferonopathies.

DESIGN We first merge various risk factors from federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with COVID-19 cases as of June 13th in contiguous US counties (N = 3,042). We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county. CONCLUSIONS The pre-existing social structure like residential segregation may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and aggravate racial/ethnic health disparities in infections.

However, mesh fixation with sutures to avoid dislocation has been considered as a cause of chronic pain and discomfort. A new self-gripping mesh (Parietene Progrip; Coviden) has been developed, which is making the use of sutureless for inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the outcomes of open Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair using new self-gripping mesh or sutured mesh. METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and reference lists were searched for controlled trials of self-gripping mesh versus sutured mesh for open inguinal hernia repair from January 2005 to February 2013. The primary outcomes were chronic pain and recurrence. Secondary outcomes were duration of operation, wound infection, hematoma, seroma formation, postoperative pain, hospital stay, and time to return to work. The methodology was in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for interventional systematic reviews and written based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. RESULTS A total of seven studies, representing 1353 patients were included. There was no effect on chronic pain (risk difference -0.02 [95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.03], P = 0.40) or recurrence (risk difference -0.00 [95% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.01], P = 0.57). No significant differences were noted in terms of secondary outcomes, such as wound infection, hematoma, and seroma formation, between self-gripping and sutured mesh repair. But the mean operative duration was shorter in the self-gripping mesh group than sutured mesh group. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results, both meshes appear to result in similar postoperation outcomes.

There is scarce literature regarding the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes for these patients with coexisting viral infections (seropositive HNSCC). We conducted this study to assess the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes (overall survival [OS] and disease-specific survival [DSS]) of seropositive HNSCC patients. Methodology This was a retrospective cohort study on seropositive HNSCC patients registered at our center from 2012 to 2014. The viral infections were identified by the presence of the antibodies to these viruses in the patient's blood samples. Results Out of the 19,137 HNSCC patients registered, 156 patients had HBV, HCV, and/or HIV infection. Among these, HBV infection was the most common (n = 86/156, 55.1%) followed by HIV infection (n = 36/156, 23.1%) and HCV infection (n = 29/156, 18.6%).

Laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair using the Pauli technique was performed successfully with no recurrence after a 4-month follow-up. Although there are concerns about potential mesh-related complications and long-term results, this novel approach can be a successful option for parastomal hernia repair. As far as we know, this is the first English-language report on the application of Pauli parastomal hernia repair combined with a pure laparoscopic approach.","Imamura, Kiyotaka; Takada, Minoru; Umemoto, Kazufumi; Furukawa, Shotaro; Ambo, Yoshiyasu; Nakamura, Fumitaka",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,315,31

The disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread rapidly causing a worldwide pandemic. Here we examine the added value of near real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected patients during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 containment in Australia and compare findings from genomic surveillance with predictions of a computational agent-based model (ABM). Using the Australian census data, the ABM generates over 24 million software agents representing the population of Australia, each with demographic attributes of an anonymous individual. It then simulates transmission of the disease over time, spreading from specific infection sources, using contact rates of individuals within different social contexts. We report that the prospective sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clarified the probable source of infection in cases where epidemiological links could not be determined, significantly decreased the proportion of COVID-19 cases with contentious links, documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent transmission in several institutions and identified previously unsuspected links. Only a quarter of sequenced cases appeared to be locally acquired and were concordant with predictions from the ABM. These high-resolution genomic data are crucial to track cases with locally acquired COVID-19 and for timely recognition of independent importations once border restrictions are lifted and trade and travel resume.","Rockett, Rebecca J; Arnott, Alicia; Lam, Connie; Sadsad, Rosemarie; Timms, Verlaine; Gray, Karen-Ann; Eden, John-Sebastian; Chang, Sheryl; Gall, Mailie; Draper, Jenny; Sim, Eby M; Bachmann, Nathan L; Carter, Ian; Basile, Kerri; Byun, Roy; O'Sullivan, Matthew V; Chen, Sharon C-A; Maddocks, Susan; Sorrell, Tania C; Dwyer, Dominic E; Holmes, Edward C; Kok, Jen; Prokopenko, Mikhail; Sintchenko, Vitali",Nature medicine,315,12

This study aimed to assess whether the surgeon's experience has an effect on 1-year symptom scores and patient satisfaction. METHODS All the patients who underwent antireflux surgery were entered into a prospectively maintained database including 1-year postoperative symptom scores. The database was queried in June 2008 to identify patients who had been followed up for 1 year. To decrease variability, the patients with a large hiatal hernia (>5 cm), paraesophageal hernia, treatment with partial fundoplication, a required Collis gastroplasty, or treatment with a transthoracic procedure were excluded from the study. RESULTS From September 2003 to March 2007, 215 consecutive patients underwent primary antireflux surgery. Of these 215 patients, 158 (93 women with a mean age of 50.9 ± 13.6 years; range, 18-87 years) met the inclusion criteria and were divided into three groups: early group (9/2003-10/2004), mid group (10/2004-12/2005), and late group (12/2005-3/2007). Experience significantly decreased the mean operative time (P < 0.05) and the hospital stay (P < 0.05). Additionally, the number of patients who required reoperative intervention also decreased with experience. There was no difference in the patient-reported symptom scores at 1 year for heartburn (mean, 0.3 ± 0.7), regurgitation (mean, 0.1 ± 0.4), or dysphagia (mean, 0.3 ± 0.6) (P > 0.05 for each). However, chest pain (mean, 0.2 ± 0.4) was significantly improved with experience (P < 0.05). The overall patient-reported mean satisfaction was 9.0 ± 1.9 (P > 0.05, scale, 1-10), and 14.5% (19/131) of the patients reported use of acid suppression medications. CONCLUSIONS A high degree of 1-year symptom resolution and satisfaction can be achieved even early in a surgeon's experience provided there is adequate training and maintenance of strict adherence to technique.","Tsuboi, Kazuto; Gazallo, Juliana; Yano, Fumiaki; Filipi, Charles J; Mittal, Sumeet K",Surgical endoscopy,315,27

It is estimated that trocar port hernias occur more often in obese patients due to their obesity and because the ports are not closed routinely. The aim of the present study was to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and management of patients with trocar port hernias after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS All patients who were operated between 2006 and 2013 were included. During the study period, the trocar ports were not closed routinely. All patients who had any symptomatic abdominal wall hernia during follow-up were included. RESULTS Overall, 1524 laparoscopic bariatric procedures were performed. There were 1249 female (82 %) and 275 male (18 %) patients. The mean age was 44 years, and median body mass index was 43 kg/m(2). Patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) (n = 859), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (n = 364), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (n = 68), revisional surgery (n = 226), and other procedures (n = 7). Three hundred and one patients (20 %) had one or more postoperative complications and the overall mortality was 0.3 % (four patients). There were 14 patients (0.9 %) with an abdominal wall hernia, of which eight (0.5 %) had a trocar port hernia, three (0.2 %) an incisional hernia from other previous surgery, and three (0.2 %) an umbilical hernia. Gender, age, BMI, smoking, type II diabetes, procedure type, complications, and weight loss were not associated with the occurrence of abdominal wall hernias. CONCLUSIONS Trocar port hernias after bariatric surgery occur seldom if the trocar port is not routinely closed.","Coblijn, Usha K; de Raaff, Christel A L; van Wagensveld, Bart A; van Tets, Willem F; de Castro, Steve M M",Obesity surgery,315,5

In this study, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay to measure the half-lives of approximately 30 human lysosomal membrane proteins (LMPs) and identified RNF152 and LAPTM4A as short-lived membrane proteins. The degradation of both proteins is ubiquitin dependent. RNF152 is a transmembrane E3 ligase that ubiquitinates itself, whereas LAPTM4A uses its carboxyl-terminal PY motifs to recruit NEDD4-1 for ubiquitination. After ubiquitination, they are internalized into the lysosome lumen by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery for degradation. Strikingly, when ectopically expressed in budding yeast, human RNF152 is still degraded by the vacuole (yeast lysosome) in an ESCRT-dependent manner. Thus, our study uncovered a conserved mechanism to down-regulate lysosome membrane proteins.","Zhang, Weichao; Yang, Xi; Chen, Liang; Liu, Yun-Yu; Venkatarangan, Varsha; Reist, Lucas; Hanson, Phyllis; Xu, Haoxing; Wang, Yanzhuang; Li, Ming",PLoS biology,315,24

Because of its high mortality and ease of transmission from human to human, Ebola virus remains a biological threat for which effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are needed. An understanding of the mechanisms of Ebola virus pathogenesis is critical for developing antiviral therapeutics. Here, we report that productive replication of Ebola virus is modulated by the c-Abl1 tyrosine kinase. Release of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) in a cell culture cotransfection system was inhibited by c-Abl1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or by Abl-specific kinase inhibitors and required tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ebola matrix protein VP40. Expression of c-Abl1 stimulated an increase in phosphorylation of tyrosine 13 (Y(13)) of VP40, and mutation of Y(13) to alanine decreased the release of Ebola VLPs. Productive replication of the highly pathogenic Ebola virus Zaire strain was inhibited by c-Abl1-specific siRNAs or by the Abl-family inhibitor nilotinib by up to four orders of magnitude. These data indicate that c-Abl1 regulates budding or release of filoviruses through a mechanism involving phosphorylation of VP40. This step of the virus life cycle therefore may represent a target for antiviral therapy.","García, Mayra; Cooper, Arik; Shi, Wei; Bornmann, William; Carrion, Ricardo; Kalman, Daniel; Nabel, Gary J",Science translational medicine,315,1

Such practices have been limited by concerns about potential damage to the lead and impairment of performance. OBJECTIVE This study sought to determine the extent of overt damage following maximal tension from tying sutures directly around SCS leads. DESIGN Twenty-eight SCS leads were prospectively exposed to 56 suture knots that were tightened under controlled conditions to the suture's breaking point. OUTCOME MEASURES Lead damage was evaluated by high power microscopy and assessment of lead impedance. RESULTS None of the leads had evidence of substantial physical damage or electrical impairment. CONCLUSIONS This small study suggests that anchoring directly to the lead appears to produce minimal damage, but these preliminary data must be confirmed and expanded.","Kreis, Paul G; Fishman, Scott M; Chau, Katherine",Pain medicine,315,16

OBJECTIVES Evaluate the relative properties of four leading candidate trial designs - 'single-factor', 'multi-arm', 'all-in-one', and 'factorial' designs - for assessing individual and/or combination prevention intervention approaches. METHODS Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted, assuming a putative combination approach could choose its components from two candidate biomedical interventions, i.e. Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and three candidate behavioral interventions, i.e. linkage-to-care, counseling, and use of condoms. Various scenarios for individual components' effect sizes, their possible interaction, and the sample size based on real clinical studies are considered. RESULTS The all-in-one and factorial designs used to assess a combination approach and the multi-arm design used to assess multiple individual components are consistently more powerful than single-factor designs. The all-in-one design is powerful when the individual components are effective without negative interaction, while the factorial design is more consistently powerful across a broad array of settings. CONCLUSIONS The multi-arm design is useful for evaluating single factor regimens, while the all-in-one and factorial designs are sensitive in assessing the overall efficacy when there is interest in combining individual component regimens anticipated to have complementary mechanisms. The factorial design is a preferred approach when assessing combination regimens due to its favorable power properties and since it is the only design providing direct insights about the contribution of individual components to the combination approach's overall efficacy and about potential interactions.","Chen, Ying Qing; Peng, Lili; Wang, Yixin; Appelmans, Eline; Dasgupta, Sayan; Fleming, Thomas R",HIV research & clinical practice,315,1

Moreover, most cells release a range of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that mediate intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological settings. In addition to a better understanding of their biological functions, the diagnostic and therapeutic prospects of EVs, particularly the nano-sized small EVs (sEVs, exosomes), are currently being rigorously pursued. While EVs and viruses such as retroviruses might have evolved independently, they share a number of similar characteristics, including biogenesis pathways, size distribution, cargo, and cell-targeting mechanisms. The interplay of EVs with viruses has profound effects on viral replication and infectivity. Our research indicates that sEVs, produced by primary human trophoblasts, can endow other non-placental cell types with antiviral response. Better insights into the interaction of EVs with viruses may illuminate new ways to attenuate viral infections during pregnancy, and perhaps develop new antiviral therapeutics to protect the feto-placental unit during critical times of human development.","Ouyang, Yingshi; Mouillet, Jean-Francois; Sorkin, Alexander; Sadovsky, Yoel",American journal of reproductive immunology,315,12

Recent studies have shown that many other viruses also encode PBM-containing proteins that bind to cellular PDZ proteins. Interestingly, these recently recognized viruses include not only some with oncogenic potential (hepatitis B virus, rhesus papillomavirus, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) but also many without this potential (influenza virus, Dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus). Examination of the cellular PDZ proteins that are targets of viral PBMs reveals that the viral proteins often interact with the same or similar types of PDZ proteins, most notably Dlg1 and other members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, as well as Scribble. In addition, cellular PDZ protein targets of viral PBMs commonly control tight junction formation, cell polarity establishment, and apoptosis. These findings reveal a new theme in virology wherein many different virus families encode proteins that bind and perturb the function of cellular PDZ proteins. The inhibition or perturbation of the function of cellular PDZ proteins appears to be a widely used strategy for viruses to enhance their replication, disseminate in the host, and transmit to new hosts.","Javier, Ronald T; Rice, Andrew P",Journal of virology,315,1

A total of 20.2% of the samples was positive for coronavirus, 8.7% for adenovirus, and 3.8% for herpesvirus. No paramyxoviruses were detected. All coronaviruses were identified as viruses of the Gammacoronavirus genus, closely related to the infectious bronchitis virus clade (bootstrap clade support=75%). All adenovirus samples were identified as Aviadenovirus, related to a gull and falcon adenovirus (Bayesian posterior probability=0.86). The herpesviruses identified were related to the infectious laryngotracheitis virus ( Gallid herpesvirus 1) of the genus Iltovirus (bootstrap clade support=99%). We provide information about the diversity of viruses circulating among apparently healthy Neotropic Cormorants.","Verdugo, Claudio; Pinto, Adrián; Ariyama, Naomi; Moroni, Manuel; Hernandez, Carlos",Journal of wildlife diseases,315,24

We present our preliminary results after intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the newly developed transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™, Covidien, MA, USA). Between 2008 and June 2013, 51 patients underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer. A total of 12 patients underwent LTG: of these, 5 received an intracorporeal linear side-to-side esophagojejunal anastomosis and the remaining 7 underwent intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil™ system. Short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery in any patients. The mean operative time was significantly shorter in the OrVil™ than in the side-to-side group (261.4 ± 12.0 vs 333.0 ± 15.0 minutes, respectively, p = 0.005). Postoperative fluorography revealed no anastomosis leakage or stenosis in either groups. All patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative day 5 and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 9 days. Intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the OrVil™ system is technically feasible and safe in LTG. This technique may be considered a simple and time-saving alternative to the side-to-side linear esophagojejunostomy.","Cianchi, Fabio; Macrì, Giuseppe; Indennitate, Giampiero; Mallardi, Beatrice; Trallori, Giacomo; Biagini, Maria Rosa; Badii, Benedetta; Staderini, Fabio; Perigli, Giuliano",SpringerPlus,315,20

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand the different levels of regulation of this symbiosis to enhance its nitrogen-fixation efficiency. A different line of evidence attests to the relevance of early molecular events in the establishment of a successful symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin, known to be effective for prevention of VTEs after primary arthroplasty, is also effective after revision TJA. METHODS We studied 2997 consecutive patients who underwent revision TJA between 2005 and 2013 and were treated with intermittent pneumatic compression devices and either aspirin (534 patients) or warfarin (2463 patients) for VTE prophylaxis. Pertinent data including the incidence of symptomatic VTEs, bleeding events, infection, and mortality were retrieved from our prospectively collected database. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic VTEs was significantly higher in the warfarin group at 1.75% (43 of 2463) compared with 0.56% (3 of 534) in the aspirin group (odds ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.03-16.3; P = .03). There was a higher rate of bleeding events with administration of warfarin (1.5%) compared with aspirin (0.4%; P = .02; odds ratio: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.2-34.0). The rate of surgical site infection was similar between the aspirin group and the warfarin group (1.61% and 1.70%, respectively). CONCLUSION Administration of aspirin as prophylaxis against VTEs after revision arthroplasty may be a viable option as it appears to be more effective than warfarin in prevention of symptomatic VTEs and is associated with a lower rate of complications.","Deirmengian, Gregory K; Heller, Snir; Smith, Eric B; Maltenfort, Mitchell; Chen, Antonia F; Parvizi, Javad",The Journal of arthroplasty,315,1

In times of a severe public health crisis, people rely heavily on media coverage to stay informed. Communicating with others about this coverage can help them gain deeper insights and evaluate pandemic-related information. According to the two-step flow of communication, opinion leaders, such as health experts, play an important role in interpersonal communication by disseminating information, influencing others, and providing orientation. To examine the nature of interpersonal communication about pandemic-related media coverage, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews. We explored: a) the communicative roles within the informal social network, b) the functions of the communication for the individual, and c) the potential transformations in the trajectory of the pandemic. Findings show that communication with close and more distant social contacts occurred largely on an equal basis, while the rare opinion leaders mainly emerged as information brokers. Communication about media coverage serves the functions of information sharing and retrieving, information validation, and coping with negative emotions. Finally, communication partners, roles, and conversational topics partly changed over time. Our study extends existing research on interpersonal communication about health topics, as well as on the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wagner, Anna; Reifegerste, Doreen",Health communication,315,20

This paper presents a rapid realist review protocol that will systematically review the literature that examines QCP-Ms in practice; what worked, or did not work for whom, in what contexts, to what extent, how and why? Methods : The review will explore if there are benefits of using the QCP-Ms and what are the contexts in which these mechanisms are triggered. The essence of this rapid realist review is to ascertain how a change in context generates a particular mechanism that produces specific outcomes. A number of steps will occur including locating existing theories on implementation of quality care metrics, searching the evidence, selecting relevant documents, data extraction, validation of findings, synthesising and refining programme theory. This strategy may help to describe potential consequences resulting from changes in context and their interactions with mechanisms. Initial theories will be refined throughout the process by the local reference panel, comprised of eight key intervention stakeholders, knowledge users such as healthcare professionals and an expert panel. Ethical approval is not required for this rapid realist review. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the final programme theory will help to explain how QCP-Ms work in practice; for whom, why and in what circumstances. Findings of this review could help to give insights into the use of a rapid realist review as a framework and how nursing and midwifery QCP-Ms have been implemented previously.","O'Connor, Laserina; Coffey, Alice; Lambert, Veronica; Casey, Mary; McNamara, Martin; Teeling, Sean Paul; O'Doherty, Jane; Barnard, Marlize; Corcoran, Yvonne; Davies, Carmel; Doody, Owen; Frawley, Timothy; O'Brien, Denise; Redmond, Catherine; Smith, Rita; Somanadhan, Suja; Noonan, Maria; Bradshaw, Carmel; Tuohy, Dympna; Gallen, Anne",HRB open research,315,1

A frequently observed reason for secondary loss of response to TNF blockers is inadequate drug exposure and sub-therapeutic serum drug concentrations. Areas covered: This review presents an overview of recent research on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-based dosing with anti-TNF agents in IBD. The role of reactive and proactive TDM is discussed and different approaches how to optimize anti-TNF treatment. Expert opinion: Due to variations within and between patients, the 'one size fits all' theory does not apply to all IBD patients receiving anti-TNF agents. Timing of TDM (i.e. reactive versus proactive) is a matter of debate. Both strategies might optimize anti-TNF treatment, although most trials did not show a clinical benefit compared to conventional dosing up to now. So-called dashboard systems might have an additive value in the optimisation of anti-TNF treatment, since these tools enable clinicians to really personalize anti-TNF treatment.","Strik, Anne S; Berends, Sophie E; Löwenberg, Mark",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,315,1

Thus, we compared the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of a new high-frequency electric welding (HFEW) system for sealing the small bowel versus a hand-sewn in vivo pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS The 96 bowel segments of three pigs were randomized to be sutured either by the HFEW-300 PATONMED device (E.O. Paton Electric Welding Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine) or hand-sewn, and mucosa-to-mucosa fusions were subjected in vivo testing in the pigs. Bursting pressures, suture time, thermal damage, and the temperature of sealed ends were measured. RESULTS Segments that had been treated with a hand-sutured ligature or double-sealed with HFEW were compared. Burst pressure was significantly higher in the hand-sutured group than in the HFEW group (136.2 mm Hg versus 75.8 mm Hg, P<.01). All 48 pig small bowels closed by the HFEW-300 generator showed a success rate of 100.0%. The closing time in the HFEW group was significantly shorter (P<.01). The pathological changes of the closed ends were mainly presented as acute thermal- and pressure-induced injuries. CONCLUSIONS Outcomes of the current in vivo study suggest that HFEW is an effective and safe method for ligation of the small bowel in pigs.","Han, Shuai; Cai, Zhai; Ning, Xuanjing; He, Linyun; Chen, Jun; Huang, Zonghai; Zhou, Huabin; Huang, Dequn; Zhang, Pusheng; Li, Zhou",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

This pandemic intersects with a decades-long decline in microbial diversity and ancestral microbes due to hygiene, antibiotics, and urban living (the hygiene hypothesis). High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome. In this Perspective, we explore many facets of COVID-19-induced societal changes and their possible effects on the microbiome, and discuss current and future challenges regarding the interplay between this pandemic and the microbiome. Recent recognition of the microbiome's influence on human health makes it critical to consider both how the microbiome, shaped by biosocial processes, affects susceptibility to the coronavirus and, conversely, how COVID-19 disease and prevention measures may affect the microbiome.

The records were compared with those of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with closure of the cystic duct with clips during the same period. RESULTS During the study period, 218 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed; 102 of these were performed with the LigaSure. One patient was excluded due to violation of the protocol. We experienced no cases of cystic duct leakage, but in one patient, bile leakage from the gallbladder bed was observed probably due to a small aberrant duct.

These operations have become increasingly complex involving multiple revisions, with limited healthy native tissue availability. Grafts are frequently needed when a patient's own tissue is expected to have poor wound-healing properties. To reduce the morbidity associated with autologous grafts and complications associated with synthetic grafts, acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) can be used as substitutes in genitourinary surgery as they demonstrate decreased immunogenicity and retaine structural integrity. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review is to describe the importance and potential uses of ADMs by reviewing the literature and highlighting key examples of our institution's expanded application of ADM grafts in genitourinary reconstruction. METHODS We performed a literature review for the use of ADMs in genitourinary surgery including the search terms acellular dermal matrix, alloderm, extracellular matrix, penis, penile reconstruction, intrapenile prosthesis, phalloplasty, neophallus, urethroplasty, artificial urinary sphincters, Peyronie's disease, and urology. We highlight 5 representative genitourinary reconstructive cases performed at this institution where ADMs contributed to surgical success. Genitourinary reconstructive surgeries that have used ADMs in the literature included neophallus construction for gender affirmation, phalloplasty for trauma, penile augmentation, and plaque excision and grafting for Peyronie's disease. RESULTS Biomechanical studies across different graft types are limited in genitourinary applications. Initial studies using ADMs indicate benefits of limited inflammatory response, finite elasticity, and substantial tensile strength, acceptably mimicking properties of the native tissue. CONCLUSION Our experience and the current literature suggest that human ADM is a valuable option for tunica albuginea replacement, but its use to support free grafts should be cautioned secondary to graft take.

Specifically, researchers sought to understand if pharmacy patients were comfortable with being immunized by a pharmacy technician, and also if knowing the technician personally, knowing that the technician was trained to immunize, the waiting time, or the patient age were factors that changed the patient comfort level. METHODS Qualitative, semi-structured, key informant interviews were conducted using a 12-item interview script. Participants were walk-in patients from 3 chain community pharmacies in a state in which technicians have not started to administer immunizations, but in which the practice is not prohibited. RESULTS A total of 46 pharmacy patients were interviewed and the following 4 themes emerged from the resulting transcripts: pharmacy patients support immunization by pharmacy technicians to increase the accessibility and decrease the waiting time, even for pediatric patients; patients value positive, trusting relationships with the pharmacy team, and knowing technicians had proper immunization technique training added to the patients' feelings of comfort; participants believed that allowing technicians to immunize would broaden the technician's responsibilities and balance the workload among the pharmacy team; and some patients still choose not to be vaccinated at a pharmacy. CONCLUSION This study sought to gather pharmacy patient perspectives about receiving immunizations from pharmacy technicians. The results showed that pharmacy patients support the additional role of pharmacy technicians as immunizers in general. Participants also provided information that can be applied by pharmacy leaders as more technicians begin to administer immunizations.","McKeirnan, Kimberly C; Kaur, Simarleen",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,315,1

The insufficient lesion-to-eloquence distance (LED) is related to poor neurological outcomes. This paper reports the use of in situ embolization combined with surgical resection in a one-staged hybrid operation for eloquent area protection. Nine patients who underwent one-staged in situ embolization combined with surgical resection were selected from the database of a prospective clinical trial (NCT03774017). Nidus got partial in situ embolization in the parts located near/within the eloquence. The rest of nidus was removed via a microsurgical procedure in the same operation. The in situ embolization ensured a sufficient LED to prevent eloquent areas and tracts from being damaged in the subsequent resection. All of the patients achieved complete obliteration with no neurological deficits or complications. One-staged hybrid operation initiates closer cooperation between surgical and endovascular treatments and proposes an integrative therapeutic mode for AVMs. The in situ embolization combined with surgical resection is safe and effective for improving the functional outcome of AVMs with eloquence and tracts involved. The clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03774017, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03774017).","Wang, Mingze; Qiu, Hancheng; Cao, Yong; Wang, Shuo; Zhao, Jizong",Neurosurgical review,315,1

This study aims to estimate patient and health system costs of managing pregnancy and birth-related complications in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify costing studies published and unpublished, from January 2000 to May 2019. The search was done in Pubmed, EMBASE, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases and grey literature. The study was registered in PROSPERO with registration No. CRD42019119316. All costs were converted to 2018 US dollars using relevant Consumer Price Indices. RESULTS Out of 1652 studies identified, 48 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included studies were of moderate to high quality. Spontaneous vaginal delivery cost patients and health systems between USD 6-52 and USD 8-73, but cesarean section costs between USD 56-377 and USD 80-562, respectively. Patient and health system costs of abortion range between USD 11-66 and USD 40-298, while post-abortion care costs between USD 21-158 and USD 46-151, respectively. The patient and health system costs for managing a case of eclampsia range between USD 52-231 and USD 123-186, while for maternal hemorrhage they range between USD 65-196 and USD 30-127, respectively. Patient cost for caring low-birth weight babies ranges between USD 38-489 while the health system cost was estimated to be USD 514. CONCLUSION This is the first systematic review to compile comprehensive up-to-date patient and health system costs of managing pregnancy and birth-related complications in sub-Saharan Africa. It indicates that these costs are relatively high in this region and that patient costs were largely catastrophic relative to a 10 % of average national per capita income.","Mori, Amani Thomas; Binyaruka, Peter; Hangoma, Peter; Robberstad, Bjarne; Sandoy, Ingvild",Health economics review,315,23

It is a particularly crucial issue in pediatric anesthesia, in the context of the recent controversies about the potential neurological consequences of the main anesthetic drugs on the developing brain. The electroencephalogram signal reflects the electrical activity of the neurons in the cerebral cortex. It is thus the key to assessment of the level of hypnosis. Beyond visual analysis, several monitoring devices allow an automated treatment of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, combining time and frequency domain analysis. Each of these monitors focuses on a specific combination of characteristics of the signal and provides the clinician with useful information that remains, however, partial. For a comprehensive approach of the EEG-derived indices, the main features of the normal EEG, in adults and children, will be presented in the awake state and during sleep. Age-related modifications accompanying cerebral maturation during infancy and childhood will be detailed. Then, this review will provide an update on how anesthetic drugs, particularly hypnotics, influence the EEG signal, and how the main available monitors analyze these drug-induced modifications. The relationships between pain, memory, and the EEG will be discussed. Finally, this review will focus on some specific EEG features such as the electrical epileptoid activity observed under sevoflurane anesthesia. The EEG signal is the best window we have on cortical brain activity and provides a fair pharmacodynamic feedback of the effects of hypnotics. However, the cortex is only one of several targets of anesthesia. Hypnotics and opiates, have also subcortical primary targets, and the EEG performances in the evaluation or prediction of nociception are poor. Monitoring subcortical structures in combination with the EEG might in the future allow a better evaluation and a more precise adaptation of balanced anesthesia.","Constant, Isabelle; Sabourdin, Nada",Paediatric anaesthesia,315,30

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release records of patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization from U.S. hospitals from March to November 2020 (N = 269,674 after exclusion), we estimated risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RR) of intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (ICU/MV) and of death among patients with T1DM compared with patients without diabetes or with T2DM. Logistic models were adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Models adjusted for additional demographic and clinical characteristics were used to examine whether other factors account for the associations between T1DM and severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS Compared with patients without diabetes, T1DM was associated with a 21% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43-1.56) and a 5% higher absolute risk of mortality (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07; RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.57), with adjustment for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Compared with T2DM, T1DM was associated with a 9% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.12; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.22), but no difference in mortality (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13). After adjustment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurring before or at COVID-19 diagnosis, patients with T1DM no longer had increased risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03) and had lower mortality (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01) in comparisons with patients with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS Patients with T1DM hospitalized for COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe outcomes than those without diabetes. Higher risk of ICU/MV in patients with T1DM than in patients with T2DM was largely accounted for by the presence of DKA. These findings might further guide recommendations related to diabetes management and the prevention of COVID-19.","Barrett, Catherine E; Park, Joohyun; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Baggs, James; Cheng, Yiling J; Zhang, Ping; Imperatore, Giuseppina; Pavkov, Meda E",Diabetes care,315,1

Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are administered over 1-2.5 h traditionally; however, the need for IV infusions places a strain on medical centers with respect to scheduling, preparation, and administration. A novel fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PHESGO®, PH FDC SC) can be administered in approximately 5-8 min. PH FDC SC was non-inferior to IV pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in terms of pertuzumab and trastuzumab serum levels in the phase III FeDeriCa study, which enrolled 500 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Total pathologic complete response rates were comparable after PH FDC SC (59.7%) or IV pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (59.5%), as was the incidence of grade ≥3 (48.8% vs 52.8%) and serious adverse events (16.1% vs 17.9%). The results of a phase II clinical trial (PHranceSCa) showed that a majority of patients (85%) preferred PH FDC SC treatment over IV pertuzumab plus trastuzumab. A US multicenter expanded access study (NCT04395508) is evaluating the safety of PH FDC SC administered at home by nurse providers in patients receiving maintenance HER2-targeted therapy every 3 weeks. This product takes much less time to administer than IV pertuzumab-trastuzumab and has the potential to alleviate time constraints for patients and busy clinics.

The objective of this study was to examine the level of concern of Australians regarding travel during Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and how this impacted on their travel. METHODS Data were collected by interviews as part of the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) 2009. Specific questions were incorporated regarding travel and Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze associations between demographic variables and concern and likelihood of cancelling travel. RESULTS There were 1,292 respondents (41.5% response rate). The sample was nearly equally divided between males and females (50.2% vs 49.8%). Younger people (18-34 y) were under-represented in the sample; older people (> 55 y) were over-represented in the sample. About half (53.2%) of respondents indicated some level of concern about Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 when traveling and just over one-third (35.5%) indicated they would likely cancel their air travel if they had a cough and fever that lasted more than one day. When cross-tabulating these responses, people who expressed concern regarding Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 when they traveled were more likely than those without concern to cancel their air travel if they had a cough and fever lasting more than one day (44.7% vs 27.7%, χ² = 33.53, p < 0.001). People with higher levels of education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.651], people with higher incomes (AOR: 0.528) and people living outside of metropolitan Southeast Queensland (AOR: 0.589) were less likely to be concerned about Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 when traveling, and younger people (AOR: 0.469) were less likely than others to cancel travel if they had a cough and fever. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was of some concern to more than half of Queensland travelers. None-the-less, the majority of Queenslanders would not have postponed their own travel, even if they exhibited symptoms consistent with Pandemic (H1N1) 2009.","Leggat, Peter A; Brown, Lawrence H; Aitken, Peter; Speare, Richard",Journal of travel medicine,315,7

DESIGN Retrospective database analysis. SETTING The National Inpatient Sample database. PATIENTS Patients admitted to the hospital for diverticulitis from 2002 to 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient characteristics, surgical approach, and mortality were evaluated for elective or emergent admission. RESULTS A total of 1,073,397 patients were admitted with diverticulitis (emergent: 78.3%, elective: 21.7%). The emergent admission rate increased by 9.5% over the study period. For emergent patients, 12.2% underwent urgent surgical resection and 87.8% were treated with nonoperative methods (percutaneous abscess drainage: 1.88% and medical treatment: 85.92%). There was only a 4.3% increase in urgent surgical resections, while elective surgical resections increased by 38.7.%. The overall rate of elective laparoscopic colon resection was 10.5%. Elective laparoscopic surgery nearly doubled from 6.9% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2007 (P < .001). Primary anastomosis rates increased for elective resections over time (92.1% in 2002 to 94.5% in 2007; P < .001). For urgent open operation, use of colostomy decreased significantly from 61.2% in 2002 to 54.0% in 2007 (P < .001). In-hospital mortality significantly decreased in both elective and urgent surgery (elective: 0.53% in 2002 to 0.44% in 2007; P = .001; urgent: 4.5% in 2002 to 2.5% in 2007; P < .001). CONCLUSION Diverticulitis continues to be a source of significant morbidity in the United States. However, our data show a trend toward increased use of laparoscopic techniques for elective operations and primary anastomosis for urgent operations.","Masoomi, Hossein; Buchberg, Brian S; Magno, Cheryl; Mills, Steven D; Stamos, Michael J",Archives of surgery,315,24

Specifically, isolation early in life, during critical periods of brain development, increases the risk of psychiatric disorders later in life. Previous studies of isolation models in mice have shown distinct neurological abnormalities in various regions of the brain, but the mechanism linking the experience of isolation to these phenotypes is unclear. In this study, we show that ΔFosB, a long-lived transcription factor associated with neuronal activity, chronic stress, and drug-induced neuroplasticity, is upregulated in the prelimbic/infralimbic (PL/IL) region of the cortex and and hippocampus of adult C57BL/6 J mice transiently isolated for two weeks post-weaning. Additionally, a related transcription factor, FosB, is also increased in the PL/IL in socially isolated females.In contrast, both ΔFosB and FosB, are increased in male mice isolated for six weeks from weaning until tissue collection. These results show that short-term isolation during the critical post-weaning period has long-lasting and sex-dependent effects on gene expression in brain, and that FosB/ΔFosB expression provides a potential mechanistic link between post-weaning social isolation and associated neurological abnormalities.","Noback, Michael; Zhang, Gongliang; White, Noelle; Barrow, James C; Carr, Gregory V",Neuroscience letters,315,1

STATE OF THE ART Inherited WMD are a group of disorders often seen in childhood. In adulthood, progressive WMDs are rare, apart from the common nonspecific causes of hypertension and other cerebrovascular diseases. The pattern of WMDs on neuroimaging can be an important clue to the final diagnosis. Due to the adoption of a combined clinical-imaging-laboratory approach, WMD is becoming better recognised, in addition to the rapidly evolving field of genomics in this area. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS While paediatric WMDs have a well-defined and literature-based clinical-laboratory approach to diagnosis, adult-onset WMDs remain an important, pathologically diverse, radiographic phenotype, with different and distinct neuropathologies among the various subtypes of WMD. Adult-onset WMDs comprise a wide collection of both acquired and inherited aetiologies. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neurological complications are emerging, we are as yet unaware of it causing WMD outside of post-anoxic changes. It is important to recognise WMD as a potentially undefined acquired or genetic syndrome, even when extensive full genome testing reveals variants of unknown significance. FUTURE DIRECTIONS We propose a combined clinical-imaging-laboratory approach to WMD and continued exploration of acquired and genetic factors. Adult-onset WMD, even given this approach, can be challenging because hypertension is often comorbid. Therefore, we propose that undiagnosed patients with WMD be entered into multicentre National Organisation for Rare Diseases registries to help researchers worldwide make new discoveries that will hopefully translate into future cures.","Hasan, Tasneem F; Tipton, Philip W; Vatz, Kenneth A; Brown, Suzanne M; Thottempudi, Neeharika; Kamireddi, Prasuna; Atwal, Paldeep S; Wszolek, Zbigniew K; Freeman, William D",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,315,1

These limitations make these studies unsuitable for determining how to use new metrics such as acute workload, chronic workload, and their ratio for reducing injury risk. The main overarching concerns are the lack of a conceptual framework and reference models that do not allow for appropriate interpretation of the results to define a causal structure. The lack of any conceptual framework also gives investigators too many degrees of freedom, which can dramatically increase the risk of false discoveries and confirmation bias by forcing the interpretation of results toward common beliefs and accepted training principles. Specifically, we underline methodologic concerns relating to (1) measure of exposures, (2) pitfalls of using ratios, (3) training-load measures, (4) time windows, (5) discretization and reference category, (6) injury definitions, (7) unclear analyses, (8) sample size and generalizability, (9) missing data, and (10) standards and quality of reporting.

The authors prefer to preserve the nipple-areola complex on a dermoglandular pedicle. They sought to identify detectability of technique, assess patient satisfaction, and outline a treatment algorithm for this population. METHODS Ten male massive weight loss patients underwent chest-contouring procedures over a period of 6 years and were surveyed to identify satisfaction with reconstruction. Preoperative photographs were used to devise a classification system. Twenty-seven medical professionals evaluated and rated digital photographs of the patients. RESULTS Eight patients had pedicled reconstructions and two had free-nipple grafts. Mean age was 42.9 +/- 9.5 years, mean pre-weight loss body mass index was 54.1 +/- 10.6, post-weight loss body mass index was 29.4 +/- 4.5, and mean change in body mass index was 24.8 +/- 9.7. All patients would have surgery again, nine would recommend it to a friend, six would go shirtless in public, nine reported no loss of nipple sensation, and three reported dysesthesias of the nipple-areola complex. Medical professionals reproducibly associated poor wound healing with free-nipple grafting and rated poorly positioned nipple-areola complexes with low aesthetic scores. Medical professional scores for chest contour and nipple-areola complex aesthetics did not correlate with technique and were lower than scores provided by the patients. CONCLUSIONS Patient satisfaction for treatment of the male chest deformity after massive weight loss is high. In carefully selected patients, preservation of the nipple-areola complex on a dermoglandular pedicle can aid in achieving an optimal aesthetic result.","Gusenoff, Jeffrey A; Coon, Devin; Rubin, J Peter",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,315,16

We examined volume and utilization trends to identify the financial break-even point that might serve to dichotomize between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led ECMO programs. METHODS Data pertaining to patients who required ECMO support between 2018 and 2019 were reviewed. ECMO staffing costs were estimated based on national trends and modelled by annual utilization and case volume. A break-even point was derived from a comparison between nurse specialist-led and perfusionist-led models. For each scenario, direct medical costs were calculated based on utilization which was in turn defined by ""low"" (4 days), ""average"" (10 days), and ""high"" (30 days) duration of time spent on ECMO. RESULTS Within the time frame, there was a total of 107 ECMO cases with a mean ECMO duration of 11 days, within the study time frame. Overall, ECMO nursing personnel costs were less than those for perfusionists ($108,000 vs $175,000). Programmatic costs were higher in the perfusionist-led versus nurse specialist-led model when annual utilization was greater than 10 cases and ECMO duration was longer than a mean of 9.7 days. There was no difference in survival between the two models. CONCLUSIONS Use of a perfusionist-led ECMO model may be more cost-conscious in the context of low utilization, smaller case volume and shorter ECMO duration. However, once annual case volume exceeds 10 and mean ECMO duration exceeds 10 days, the nurse specialist-led model may be more cost-conscious.","Dhamija, Ankit; Kakuturu, Jahnavi; Schauble, Drew; Hayanga, Heather K; Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Badhwar, Vinay; Hayanga, J W Awori",The Annals of thoracic surgery,315,25

Most severe COVID-19 cases present low lymphocytes counts, high leukocytes counts and, accumulated evidence suggests that in a subgroup of patients presenting severe COVID-19, there may be a hyperinflammatory response driving a severe hypercytokinaemia which may be, at least in part, signaling the presence of an underlying endothelial dysfunction. In this context, available data suggest a prognostic role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in various inflammatory diseases and oncological processes. Following this rationale, we hypothesized that NLR, as a marker of endothelial dysfunction, may be useful in identifying patients with a poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID-19 cases. DESIGN A retrospective observational study performed at Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, Madrid, Spain, which included 119 patients with COVID-19 from March 1 to March 31, 2020. Patients were categorized according to WHO R&D Expert Group. RESULTS Forty five (12.1%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure requiring respiratory support. Forty seven (12.6%) patients died. Those with worse outcomes were older (p=0.002) and presented significantly higher NLR at admission (p=0.001), greater increase in Peak NLR (p<0.001) and higher increasing speed of NLR (p=0.003) compared to follow up patients. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, cardiovascular disease, C-Reactive-Protein at admission and Peak NLR were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS NLR is an easily measurable, available, cost effective and reliable parameter which continuous monitoring could be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Jimeno Ruiz, Sara; Ventura, Paula Sol; Castellano Vázquez, Jose María; García-Adasme, Salvador I; Miranda García, Mario; Touza Pol, Paula; Llana Martín, Isabel; López Escobar, Alejandro",European journal of clinical investigation,315,19

However, information on the effectiveness and prevalence of vaccine serotypes post-roll out remains scarce in most African countries. Hence, this systematic review aimed to describe what is known about the decline of childhood invasive pneumococcal disease post-introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa. METHODS This systematic review included articles published between 2009 and 2018 on the implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa. We searched PubMed, Scopus and African Index Medicus for articles in English. Studies on implementation programmes of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10/13, with before and after data from different African countries, were considered eligible. The review followed the procedures published in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42016049192). RESULTS In total, 2,280 studies were identified through electronic database research, and only 8 studies were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Approximately half (n = 3) of these studies were from South Africa. The overall decline in invasive pneumococcal disease ranged from 31.7 to 80.1%. Invasive pneumococcal diseases caused by vaccine serotypes declined significantly, the decline ranged from 35.0 to 92.0%. A much higher decline (55.0-89.0%) was found in children below 24 months of age. Of all vaccine serotypes, the relative proportions of serotypes 1, 5 and 19A doubled following vaccine roll out. INTERPRETATION Following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a significant decline was observed in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes. However, data on the effectiveness in this region remain scarce, meriting continued surveillance to assess the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination to improve protection against invasive pneumococcal disease.","Ngocho, James Samwel; Magoma, Best; Olomi, Gaudencia Alois; Mahande, Michael Johnson; Msuya, Sia Emmanueli; de Jonge, Marien Isaäk; Mmbaga, Blandina Theophil",PloS one,315,20

In this experiment, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on nitric oxide synthases and whether dexamethasone could attenuate endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). SD rats received 5 mg/kg lipopolisaccharide (LPS) injection. Then arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), lung histology, lung tissue nitric oxide (NO) production and expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) were detected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 h after LPS injection. PaO2 and lung injury deteriorated upon time. Production of NO in lung tissue increased significantly particularly in the first two hours, and this change was mainly due to the over-expression of inducible NOS (iNOS), but not endothelial NOS (eNOS). Furthermore, a tight positive correlation was observed between lung injury score (LIS) and NO production level in lung tissue. Dexamethasone could ameliorate PaO2 and lung damage evidently, which were paralleled by significant decreases in the production of NO and in the expression of iNOS mRNA. In conclusion, dexamethasone could effectively attenuate endotoxin-induced lung injury through inhibiting iNOS expression and activation in the very early stage of ALI.","Yu, Zhui; Ouyang, Jing-Ping; Li, Yin-Ping",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,315,1

Here we show that interferon induced protein 35 (IFI35) inhibits swine (H3N2) influenza virus replication by directly interacting with the viral protein NS1. IFI35 binds more preferentially to the effector domain of NS1 (128-207aa) than to the viral RNA sensor RIG-I. This promotes mutual antagonism between IFI35 and NS1, and frees RIG-I from IFI35-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation. However, IFI35 does not interact with the NS1 encoded by avian (H7N9) influenza virus, resulting in IFI35 playing an opposite virus enabling role during highly pathogenic H7N9 virus infection. Notably, replacing the 128-207aa region of NS1-H7N9 with the corresponding region of NS1-H3N2 results in the chimeric NS1 acquiring the ability to bind to and mutually antagonize IFI35. IFI35 deficient mice accordingly exhibit more resistance to lethal H7N9 infection than their wild-type control exhibit. Our data uncover a novel mechanism by which IFI35 regulates RIG-I-mediated anti-viral immunity through mutual antagonism with influenza protein NS1.IMPORTANCEIAV infection poses a global health threat, and is among the most common contagious pathogens to cause severe respiratory infections in humans and animals. ISGs play a key role in host defense against IAV infection. In line with others, we show IFI35-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I to be involved in innate immunity. Moreover, we define a novel role of IFI35 in regulating the type I IFN pathway during IAV infection. We found that IFI35 regulates RIG-I mediated antiviral signaling by interacting with IAV-NS1. H3N2 NS1, but notably not H7N9 NS1, interacts with IFI35 and efficiently suppresses IFI35-dependent ubiquitination of RIG-I. IFI35 deficiency protected mice from H7N9 virus infection. Therefore, manipulation of the IFI35-NS1 provides a new approach for the development of anti-IAV treatments.","Yang, Hui; Winkler, Wendy; Wu, Xiaopeng",Journal of virology,315,4

The diagnoses of CTX and sitosterolemia are often delayed for many years because of lack of physician awareness, often resulting in significant and unnecessary progression of disease. CTX may present with chronic diarrhea, juvenile onset cataracts, strikingly large xanthomas, and neurologic disease in the setting of a normal serum cholesterol, but markedly elevated serum or plasma cholestanol levels. These patients have a defect in producing the bile acid chenodoxycholate, and oral chenodeoxycholate therapy is essential for these patients in order to prevent neurologic complications. Sitosterolemia can present with xanthomas, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, very premature heart disease, and serum cholesterol levels that may be normal or elevated, along with marked elevations of plasma β-sitosterol. These patients have a defect causing overabsorption of β-sitosterol, and the treatment of choice is oral ezetimibe. SLOS presents with growth delay, intellectual disability, multiple structural anomalies, and low serum cholesterol levels, and the defect is reduced cholesterol production. Treatment consists of dietary cholesterol supplementation and oral bile acid therapy which raises serum cholesterol levels and may improve symptoms.

The risk of injury to the neurovascular structures may depend on the type of sport involvement, although, sport-specific incidence rates are not known. Therefore, the goal of our scoping review was to provide some guidance to better inform the development of a context-fit stroke model by summarizing studies on a broad research topic related to stroke or cerebrovascular accident in sport based on a strict athlete definition. We used the guidance of Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage-process for a scoping review. Databases included MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non- Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), and Embase (OVID databases); CINAHL Plus with Full Text, SportDiscus with Full Text (Ebsco databases); and Scopus. Publication dates were from 1979-2020 across nine different countries resulting in 39 individual cases of stroke with an athlete age range of 14-56 years (95% male). The major inciting event(s) prior to stroke onset were headaches (38.4%), head trauma (30.7%), and neck injury and/or vertebral artery dissection (20.5%). Several sporting activities were represented with American football as the most prevalent (30.7%). In summary, we found that sports with an aspect of impact, collision, or microtrauma can lead to subsequent stroke. These sport-related traumatic events were often difficult to diagnose because of the longer interval before ischemia occurred. Therefore, health care providers should be particularly attuned to the possibility of stroke when evaluating athletes presenting with or without neurological deficit.","Doyle-Baker, Patricia K; Mitchell, Timothy; Hayden, K Alix",International journal of environmental research and public health,315,30

Practicing hand hygiene using alcohol-based handrub or soap and water reduces harmful organisms. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) best practice recommends empowering patients with hand hygiene knowledge and engaging their involvement to strengthen hand hygiene practices. AIMS The aim of this project was to improve hand hygiene among surgical inpatients. METHODS This evidence-based quality improvement project was conducted in three phases: the baseline audit, implementing best practice, and the postimplementation audit. Participants were patients hospitalized in three surgical wards of a 1200-bed acute care tertiary hospital. This project utilized the online JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and The Getting Research into Practice program to identify barriers and strategies. Nurses provided patients with an education pamphlet and regularly reminded them to improve their hand hygiene practices. RESULTS Ninety-four patients were audited between April and June 2018. Patients' hand hygiene practices improved from 19.1% at baseline audit to 61.7% (P < 0.01) at first follow-up audit. Patients' hand hygiene improved from 48.9 to 72.3% (P = 0.03) before meals, and from 92.6 to 98.9% (P = 0.65) after toileting. The proportion of patients who received a hand hygiene information leaflet in an appropriate language increased from 64.9 to 89.4% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Patients' involvement in the hand hygiene program has significantly improved their hand hygiene practices.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. METHODS We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8-75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0-8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0-62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0-7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3-50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8-5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0-49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5-5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5-46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2-5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3-3·1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0-11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). INTERPRETATION The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.

Our objective was to examine pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) disparities between the two populations and compare individual, social and structural factors that influence differences between MSM and trans women along the PrEP continuum. METHODS We analysed data from two population-based studies, one with trans women (Trans*National Study, 2016 - 18) and the other with MSM (National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, 2017). Trans women were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and MSM using time location sampling. Key indicators of the PrEP continuum were evaluated, including awareness, health insurance, provider discussions, recent use and adherence. Associations were also examined for PrEP continuum indicators and structural barriers (e.g. employment, homelessness). RESULTS Transwomen were more likely than MSM to be Latino/a (30.4% vs. 25.8%; prevalence ratio (PR)=1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14) or African American (7.1% vs. 4.5%; PR = 1.12, 1.02 to 1.24), live at or below the poverty limit (70.7% vs. 15.8%; PR = 1.47; 1.41 to 1.53), be unemployed (50.1% vs. 26.3%; PR = 1.18, 1.13 to 1.24), be homeless (8.4% vs. 3.5%; PR = 1.15, 1.06 to 1.25) and to have less than a college degree (PR = 1.41, 1.34 to 1.48). Trans women were more likely than MSM to have health insurance (95.7% vs. 89.7%, PR = 1.17, 1.06 to 1.28), but less likely than MSM to have heard of PrEP (79.1% vs. 96.7%; PR = 0.77, 0.73 to 0.81), talked with a provider about PrEP (35.5% vs. 54.9%; PR = 0.87, 0.83 to 0.91) and less likely than MSM to have used PrEP in the past six months (14.6% vs. 39.8%; PR = 0.80, 0.76 to 0.84). Among PrEP users, trans women were less likely to report being adherent to PrEP than MSM (70.4% vs. 87.4%; PR = 0.80, 0.70 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS We found PrEP disparities for trans women compared to MSM and the need for differentiated implementation strategies to meet the specific PrEP barriers trans women face. Inclusion of trans women's HIV risks is needed in CDC guidance for PrEP. Interventions to increase trans women's awareness of PrEP including at the provider and community level are also needed. Finally, programming that addresses trans women's barriers to housing and income is also needed to reduce PrEP disparities.","Wilson, Erin C; Turner, Caitlin M; Arayasirikul, Sean; Lightfoot, Marguerita; Scheer, Susan; Raymond, Henry F; Liu, Albert",Journal of the International AIDS Society,315,1

With the emergence of high-profile climate activists and a wider appreciation of the need for sustainable healthcare, training within radiology can no longer be excused from its responsibility to consider the environment in its actions. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the environmental impact of the travel undertaken by trainees within the Peninsula training programme, with the aim of developing practices and providing suggestions (evidence-based where possible) on how to improve the impact on the environment of trainee travel. We envisage that many of the lessons and suggestions may be transferrable to other training schemes in the UK and further afield. During the early months of 2020, in addition to the environmental crisis, COVID-19 escalated to a pandemic resulting in the alteration of working practices across the UK (and the rest of the world). This led to many environmentally beneficial working practices being adopted in Radiology in the South West Peninsula Deanery, and throughout this paper we have evaluated these changes and used our collective experience of these to inform our suggestions on how to improve the environmental sustainability of Medical and Radiological training.","Peters, Seren; Burrows, Susan; Jenkins, Paul",Postgraduate medical journal,315,1

However, several studies have shown that AChE inhibition alone cannot explain all the toxicological manifestations in prolonged exposure to OPs. The present study aimed to assess the status of antioxidants malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) (reduced), catalase, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in chronic OP-exposed groups from Cameroon and Pakistan. Molecular analysis of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) of glutathione transferases (GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1), catalase gene (CAT, rs7943316), sirtuin 1 gene (SIRT1, rs10823108), acetylcholinesterase gene (ACHE, rs2571598), and butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE, rs3495) were screened in the OP-exposed individuals to find the possible causative association with oxidative stress and toxicity. Cholinesterase and antioxidant activities were measured by colorimetric methods using a spectrophotometer. Salting-out method was employed for DNA extraction from blood followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for molecular analysis. Cholinergic enzymes were significantly decreased in OP-exposed groups. Catalase and SOD were decreased and MDA and FRAP were increased in OP-exposed groups compared to unexposed groups in both groups. GSH was decreased only in Pakistani OPs-exposed group. Molecular analysis of ACHE, BCHE, Catalase, GSTP1, and GSTM1 SNPs revealed a tentative association with their phenotypic expression that is level of antioxidant and cholinergic enzymes. The study concludes that chronic OPs exposure induces oxidative stress which is associated with the related SNP polymorphism. The toxicogenetics of understudied SNPs were examined for the first time to our understanding. The findings may lead to a newer area of investigation on OPs induced health issues and toxicogenetics.","Mbah Ntepe, Leonel Javeres; Habib, Rabia; Judith Laure, Ngondi; Raza, Saqlain; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Kuca, Kamil; Batool, Sajida; Muhammad Nurulain, Syed",International journal of molecular sciences,315,1

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations of maternal Hb concentrations with a range of maternal and infant health outcomes, accounting for the timing of measurement (preconception, and first, second, and third trimesters), etiology of anemia, and cutoff category. The systematic review included 272 studies and the meta-analysis included 95 studies. Low maternal Hb (<110 g/L) was associated with poor birth outcomes (low birth weight, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age (SGA), stillbirth, and perinatal and neonatal mortality) and adverse maternal outcomes (postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia, and blood transfusion). High maternal Hb (>130 g/L) was associated with increased odds of SGA, stillbirth, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Relationships varied by the timing of measurement and cutoff category (stronger associations with lower cutoffs); limited data were available on anemia etiology. There were insufficient data for other maternal outcomes and long-term child health outcomes. Current data are insufficient for determining if revisions to current Hb cutoffs are required. Pooled high-quality individual-level data analyses, as well as prospective cohort studies, would be valuable to inform the reevaluation of Hb cutoffs.","Young, Melissa F; Oaks, Brietta M; Tandon, Sonia; Martorell, Reynaldo; Dewey, Kathryn G; Wendt, Amanda S",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,315,16

The objective of this study was to evaluate a multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR method using Seeplex RV Detection kit (Seegene, Korea) for the detection of rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). METHODS From January to May 2007, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from pediatric patients negative for culture and DAT of traditional viral pathogens were tested with Seeplex. All the amplicons were directly sequenced and homology of the sequences was searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Patients' medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic features. RESULTS Forty-seven (26.4%) of 178 NPAs were positive: 18 rhinovirus, 15 hMPV, 4 RSV A, 3 coronavirus OC43, 3 influenza virus A, 2 adenovirus, 1 coronavirus NL63, and 1 RSV B. Based on maximum identity, each of the sequences indicating rhinovirus, hMPV, and coronavirus OC43 matched to the corresponding viruses with homology of 94-98%, 96-99%, and 98-100%, respectively. Seeplex positive patients were 0-11 yr old with a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. Clinical diagnoses included 9 pneumonia, 6 bronchiolitis, 2 cold, 1 asthma exacerbation for rhinovirus; 10 pneumonia, 4 bronchiolitis, and 1 clinical sepsis for hPMV; and 1 pneumonia, 2 croup, and 1 cold for coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS Multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR method using Seeplex RV Detection kit is a reliable test to detect rhinovirus, hMPV, and coronavirus. It may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for RSV, influenza virus, PIV, and adenovirus.","Sung, Heungsup; Park, Sook Ja; Woo, Young Dae; Choi, Byung Hoo; Kim, Mi Na",The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,315,24

METHODS A systematic review of studies published from inception to May 2020 using Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. Prospective studies, which pre-operatively assessed any imaging modality for the presence of bladder DE, and correlated with the gold standard surgical data as a reference were included. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess quality. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059872). RESULTS Of the 1,977 references identified, 8 studies (n = 1,052) were included in the analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity, from which the likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+), likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated, for all transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) techniques were 55 % (95 % CI 28-79%), 99 % (95 % CI 98-100%), 54.5 (95 % CI 18.9-157.4), 0.46 (95 % CI 0.25 - 0.85) and 119 (95 % CI 24-577), and for only two-dimensional (2D) TVS 53 % (95 % CI 23-82%), 99 % (96 % CI 97-100%), 48.8 (95 % CI 13.1-181.4), 0.47 (95 % CI 0.23 - 0.98), and 104 (95 % CI 15-711), respectively. Meta-analyses of the other modalities, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic sonography (RES), were not possible due to the limited number of studies. There was significant heterogeneity and the studies were considered poor methodologically according to the QUADAS-2 tool. CONCLUSIONS Whilst the sensitivity of TVS was limited, the specificity was excellent. Given that there is a paucity of literature for other imaging modalities, until more studies are performed, TVS should be considered as the first-line tool given it is the only modality with sufficient evidence.","Gerges, B; Li, W; Leonardi, M; Mol, B W; Condous, G","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",315,16

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological features of TD, investigate chigger mites and their hosts, and investigate the meteorological factors affecting TD incidence and the host of O. tsutsugamushi in Xiamen city, China. Data on reported TD cases were collected from 2006 to 2018. Spearman's correlation test were used for identifying the relationship between meteorological factors and TD incidence and whether meteorological factors affect the host of O. tsutsugamushi. The incidence of reported TD increased gradually from 2006, reached a peak of 4.59 per 100,000 persons in 2014, and then decreased gradually. The TD incidence was seasonal, with epidemic periods occurred mainly in summer and autumn. Patients aged 40-60 years had the highest proportion of cases, accounting for 44.44% of the total cases. Farmers had the largest number of cases among all occupational groups. Rattus Norvegicus was the most common host, accounting for the largest proportion of cases (73.00%), and the highest rat density was observed in March and October every year. There were significant positive correlations between the number of reported cases and average temperature, sunshine duration, and rainfall as well as between rat density and average temperature. On phylogenetic analysis, 7 sequences of hosts and human TD cases obtained from health records demonstrated the highest similarities to the Kato, Karp, and Gilliam strains. No correlations were observed between rat density, and sunshine duration and rainfall. The transmission of TD in Xiamen city, China, was seasonal, and its incidence was affected by several meteorological factors including average temperature, sunshine duration, and rainfall.

To address this, the present meta-analysis examined the predictive validity of Harkin and Kessler's (2011b) executive function, binding complexity, and memory load (EBL) Classification System concerning affected versus unaffected memory performance in OCD. We employed a multilevel meta-analytic approach (Viechtbauer, 2010) to accommodate the interdependent nature of the EBL model and interdependency of effect sizes (305 effect sizes from 144 studies, including 4,424 OCD patients). Results revealed that the EBL model predicted memory performance; that is, as EBL demand increases, those with OCD performed progressively worse on memory tasks. Executive function was the driving mechanism behind the EBL's impact on OCD memory performance, as it negated binding complexity, memory load, and visual or verbal task differences. Comparisons of subtask effect sizes were also generally in accord with the cognitive parameters of the EBL taxonomy. We conclude that standardized coding of tasks along individual cognitive dimensions and multilevel meta-analyses provides a new approach to examine multidimensional models of memory and cognitive performance in OCD and other disorders.

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological investigation and public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak among TFWs in an agricultural setting in British Columbia from March to May 2020. Methods An outbreak was declared on March 28, 2020 following detection of two cases of COVID-19 among a group of 63 TFWs employed by a nursery and garden centre. Outbreak control measures included immediate isolation of cases, case finding via outreach screening and testing, cohorting of asymptomatic workers and enhanced cleaning and disinfection. The outbreak was declared over on May 10, 2020. Results A total of 26 COVID-19 cases were identified among the group of TFWs; no cases were identified among local workers.

To date, although many studies have reported on the computed tomography (CT) manifestations of COVID-19, the vascular enlargement sign (VES) of COVID-19 has not been deeply examined, with the few available studies reporting an inconsistent prevalence. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the best available studies to estimate the prevalence and identify the underlying differential diagnostic value of VES. Methods We searched nine English and Chinese language databases up to April 23, 2020. Studies that evaluated CT features of COVID-19 patients and reported VES, with or without comparison with other pneumonia were included. The methodologic quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Meta-analyses with random effects models were performed to calculate the aggregate prevalence and pooled odds ratios (ORs) of VES. We also conducted meta-regression and subgroup analyses to analyze heterogeneity. Results VES findings from a total of 1969 patients were summarized and pooled across 22 studies. Our analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of VES among COVID-19 patients was 69.37% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57.40-79.20%]. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, VES manifestation was more frequently observed in confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR =6.43, 95% CI: 3.39-12.22). Studies that explicitly defined distribution of VES in the lesion area demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence (P=0.03). Subgroup analyses also revealed a relatively higher VES rate in studies with a sample size larger than 50, but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant difference in VES rates was found between different countries (China/Italy), regions (Hubei/outside Hubei), average age groups (over/less than 50-year-old), or slice thicknesses of CT scan. Extensive heterogeneity was identified across most estimates (I2>80%). Some of the variations (R2=19.73%) could be explained by VES distribution, and sample size. No significant publication bias was seen (P=0.29). Conclusions VES on thoracic CT was found in almost two-thirds of COVID-19 patients, and was more prevalent compared with that of the non-COVID-19 patients, supporting a promising role for VES in identifying pneumonia caused by coronavirus.","Lv, Haiying; Chen, Tongtong; Pan, Yaling; Wang, Hanqi; Chen, Liuping; Lu, Yong",Annals of translational medicine,315,1

After all, severe acute respiratory syndrome never made it to this country, and the only 2 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome here were imported and never spread. Local public health agencies are notoriously short-staffed and underfunded. Therefore, when a crisis looms, personnel from a multitude of areas within the agencies are called upon to help out. Under its innovative and forward-thinking leadership, the St. Louis County Department of Health internally implemented the Incident Command System, a component of the National Incident Management System. While reassignment of individuals to new responsibilities under a new and temporary reporting structure did not always go perfectly, ICS kept its promise to be adaptable to a fast-evolving situation, to clearly outline needed areas of responsibility, and to provide scaffolding that kept the Department of Health functional in chaotic times. It was able to be implemented quickly within hours of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in St. Louis County and enhanced the quality and timeliness of the public health response. This experience is being shared to provide a model of how organizations with limited personnel can use the Incident Command System to reorganize and meet unexpected challenges with increased success.","Baskin, Carole R; Barry, Mark; Cohen, Rachel E; Condren, Coleen; Crosley, Sarah; Dickhans, Carrie D; Donaldson, Kate; Gardner, Sharon; Griffin, Ken J A; Place, Arletta; Doucette, Emily D; Schmidt, Spring",Health security,315,1

This technique is expensive and associated with a long learning curve. To avoid these obstacles, we have developed an alternative approach using the Endorec(TM) trocar (Aspide, France), which combines the advantages of local transanal excision and single-port access. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients underwent transanal resection using Endorec trocar and standard laparoscopic instruments. A retrospective evaluation of the outcome of this technique was performed. RESULTS Fourteen patients were successfully operated. Rectal lesions included adenoma in ten patients, T1 adenocarcinoma in three and one T2 adenocarcinoma not amenable for abdominal surgery. The average distal margin from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 5-17 cm), and the mean diameter was 3.5 cm (range 1-5 cm). Negative margins were obtained in 13 patients (92,8 %). Median operating time was 60 min (range 20-100). The excisional area was sutured in nine patients. Median postoperative stay was 4 days (range 1-13). Postoperative complications (21 %) included postoperative fever in one patient and two patients were readmitted with rectal blood loss 6 and 15 days postoperatively and were treated with conservative measures. CONCLUSIONS Our current data show that transanal surgery using Endorec trocar is feasible and safe. Although long-term outcomes and definite indications should be yet evaluated, we believe that this new technique offers a promising alternative to TEM.","Bridoux, Valérie; Schwarz, Lilian; Suaud, Leslie; Dazza, Marie; Michot, Francis; Tuech, Jean-Jacques",International journal of colorectal disease,315,12

However, the effects of high levels of potentially toxic substances such as sulfatides--which accumulate in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)--on this regenerative ability are still largely unclear. To start addressing this question, in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to examine the behavior of multipotential neural precursors exposed to abnormally high levels of sulfatides. Following transplantation of dissociated neurospheres into the brain of presymptomatic MLD pups, the majority of donor-derived cells were distributed in a caudal to rostral direction, with higher numbers in the cortex. Most if not all of the donor cells acquired an astroglial phenotype. We found no evidence of oligodendrocyte or neuronal commitment of transplanted cells in long-term-treated MLD mice (e.g. up to 1.5 years of age). This was in line with our in vitro findings of sulfatides blocking oligodendrocyte formation after induction of differentiation in sulfatide-treated epidermal growth factor/fibroblast growth factor responsive neurospheres. Transplanted MLD mice showed an improved arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity and a significant amelioration of sulfatide metabolism, neurodegeneration and motor-learning/memory deficits. Furthermore, transplanted cells were shown to act as a source of ARSA enzyme that accumulated in endogenous brain cells, indicating the occurrence of enzyme cross-correction between transplanted and host cells. These results provide a first insight into the effect of sulfatides on the stemness properties of neural stem cells and on the effects of the MLD environment on the in vivo expectations of using neural stem cells in cell therapy.","Givogri, M I; Bottai, D; Zhu, H L; Fasano, S; Lamorte, G; Brambilla, R; Vescovi, A; Wrabetz, L; Bongarzone, E",Developmental neuroscience,315,19

Perioperative management algorithms advocate to maintain ScO2, by maintaining or increasing cardiac output (CO), e.g. with fluid infusion. We hypothesized that ScO2 would increase in responders to a standardized fluid challenge (FC) and that the relative changes in CO and ScO2 would correlate. This study is a retrospective substudy of the FLuid Responsiveness Prediction Using Extra Systoles (FLEX) trial. In the FLEX trial, patients were administered two standardized FCs (5 mL/kg ideal body weight each) during cardiac surgery. NIRS monitoring was used during the intraoperative period and CO was monitored continuously. Patients were considered responders if stroke volume increased more than 10% following FC. Datasets from 29 non-responders and 27 responders to FC were available for analysis. Relative changes of ScO2 did not change significantly in non-responders (mean difference - 0.3% ± 2.3%, p = 0.534) or in fluid responders (mean difference 1.6% ± 4.6%, p = 0.088). Relative changes in CO and ScO2 correlated significantly, p = 0.027. Increasing CO by fluid did not change cerebral oxygenation. Despite this, relative changes in CO correlated to relative changes in ScO2.

Thus, we sought to quantify how US state government spending on various services impacted infant mortality rates (IMRs) over time and whether spending differentially reduced mortality in some subpopulations. METHODS A longitudinal, repeated-measures study of US state-level infant mortality and state and local government spending for the years 2000-2016, the most recent data available. Expenditures included spending on education, social services, and environment and housing. Using generalized linear regression models, we assessed how changes in spending impacted infant mortality over time, overall and stratified by race and ethnicity and maternal age group. RESULTS State and local governments spend, on average, $9 per person. A $0.30 per-person increase in environmental spending was associated with a decrease of 0.03 deaths per 1000 live births, and a $0.73 per-person increase in social services spending was associated with a decrease of 0.02 deaths per 1000 live births. Infants born to mothers aged <20 years had the single greatest benefit from an increase in expenditures compared with all other groups. Increased expenditures in public health, housing, parks and recreation, and solid waste management were associated with the greatest reduction in overall IMR. CONCLUSIONS Investment in non-health care services was associated with lower IMRs among certain high-risk populations. Continued investments into improved social and environmental services hold promise for further reducing IMR disparities.","Goldstein, Neal D; Palumbo, Aimee J; Bellamy, Scarlett L; Purtle, Jonathan; Locke, Robert",Pediatrics,315,27

Dependence on amphetamines (AMPH) or methamphetamine (MA) is a growing global concern. Yet, there is no established pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence. A comprehensive assessment of the research literature on pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence may inform treatment guidelines and future research directions. METHODS We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature via the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for randomised controlled trials reported in the English language examining a pharmacological treatment for AMPH/MA dependence or use disorder. We included all studies published to 19 June 2019. The selected studies were evaluated for design; methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; sample size; pharmacological and (if included) psychosocial interventions; length of follow-up and follow-up schedules; outcome variables and measures; results; overall conclusions and risk of bias. Outcome measures were any reported impact of treatment related to AMPH/MA use. RESULTS Our search returned 43 studies that met our criteria, collectively enrolling 4065 participants and reporting on 23 individual pharmacotherapies, alone or in combination. Disparate outcomes and measures (n = 55 for the primary outcomes) across studies did not allow for meta-analyses. Some studies demonstrated mixed or weak positive signals (often in defined populations, e.g. men who have sex with men), with some variation in efficacy signals dependent on baseline frequency of AMPH/MA use. The most consistent positive findings have been demonstrated with stimulant agonist treatment (dexamphetamine and methylphenidate), naltrexone and topiramate. Less consistent benefits have been shown with the antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine, the glutamatergic agent riluzole and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antagonist pexacerfont; whilst in general, antidepressant medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective in reducing AMPH/MA use. CONCLUSIONS No pharmacotherapy yielded convincing results for the treatment of AMPH/MA dependence; mostly studies were underpowered and had low treatment completion rates. However, there were positive signals from several agents that warrant further investigation in larger scale studies; agonist therapies show promise. Common outcome measures should include change in use days. Future research must address the heterogeneity of AMPH/MA dependence (e.g. coexisting conditions, severity of disorder, differences between MA and AMPH dependence) and the role of psychosocial intervention.","Siefried, Krista J; Acheson, Liam S; Lintzeris, Nicholas; Ezard, Nadine",CNS drugs,315,27

The country is home to the third-largest western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) population, a subspecies upgraded to Critically Endangered on the 2016 IUCN Red List. The main threats facing chimpanzees in Sierra Leone are habitat loss and increasing interactions with humans. The Mobonda Community Conservation Project (MCCP) is a component of Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary's Community Outreach Program and Kids Environmental Education Program. The aim of MCCP is to promote community-based forest management in combination with wildlife conservation through carefully designed programs that benefit communities, wildlife, and ecologically significant habitats. MCCP also aims to promote self-sustained and integrated community landscape conservation, to facilitate policy discussions to strengthen wildlife laws, and to build the capacity of the Government to implement community-based wildlife and forestry protection projects. Since Tacugama began collecting data in Moyamba District in June 2015, the project has evolved into an assembly of components. MCCP currently works with five communities, running programs including environmental education, ecological research, biomonitoring including wildlife law enforcement, habitat rehabilitation through reforestation of identified wildlife corridors, improved sustainable livelihoods, and ecotourism initiatives. These programs contributed to a reduction in the threats facing wildlife in the area; the project has seen stable chimpanzee numbers where decrements to chimpanzee populations continue to be experienced elsewhere. Other MCCP outcomes include boosted sustainable agricultural production and higher oyster yields while decreasing the negative impact on the mangrove ecosystem allowing it to recover and support an array of important fauna and flora.","Chesney, Chloe; Casado Bolaños, Natalia; Kanneh, Bockarie Ambrose; Sillah, Ethel; Amarasekaran, Bala; Garriga, Rosa M",American journal of primatology,315,1

Crowdsourcing for participant recruitment may also be one effective strategy to address ED research disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to: (a) develop a rigorous method for assessing self-reported athropometrics; (b) determine if individuals with EDs self-select into MTurk studies assessing eating behaviors; and (c) characterize ED-related psychopathology in an MTurk sample. We recruited 400 US adults to complete an MTurk study assessing ED features. Results did not indicate the presence of a self-selection bias among individuals with EDs; however, 40% of the sample met criteria for a current ED diagnosis, with all diagnoses represented except ARFID, and 18.1% reported currently being in ED treatment. The sample was characterized by higher scores on measures of ED psychopathology compared to extant non-clinical norms. Approximately 66% of the overall sample and 73% of participants with EDs indicated that they have participated in more MTurk studies since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Finally, we identified an alternative approach to assessing self-reported height and weight that appears to reduce error, which we strongly recommend researchers conducting online surveys use. Our findings suggest that individuals with EDs appear to be overrepresented on MTurk and highlight the utility of crowdsourcing using MTurk as an ED data collection alternative during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kambanis, P Evelyna; Bottera, Angeline R; De Young, Kyle P",Eating behaviors,315,1

Manually generating a high-quality layout using this representation is labor-intensive. In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views.

After each dissection, they were subjected to air pressure up to 3 kPa. Ultrasound images and associated elastographic maps were collected at 0, 2 and 3 kPa in the intact state and strains on the internal surface were calculated using stereo-correlation in all states. Strains on the rectus abdominis and linea alba were analyzed. After the dissection of the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis, longitudinal strain was found significantly different on the linea alba (5% at 3 kPa) and on the rectus abdominis area (11% at 3 kPa). The current results highlight the importance of the rectus sheath in the structural response of the anterior part of the abdominal wall ex vivo.

The mechanism of CVD graphene growth is governed by interactions in both the gas phase and at the surface. Here we present a simulation of the CVD graphene growth mechanism which includes thermodynamics, gas phase kinetics and the surface reaction in a sequential manner. The thermodynamic simulation shows that the deposition driving force is the greatest for high carbon to hydrogen ratios and reaches a maximum at around 850 °C. No graphene growth is observed below this temperature. The surface kinetic model also shows that below this temperature, the carbon surface concentration is less than the solubility limit, thus no film can grow. The effect of the reaction chamber geometry on the product concentrations was clear from the gas phase decomposition reactions. The gas residence times studied here (around 0.07 s) show that the optimum gas phase composition is far from that expected at thermodynamic equilibrium. The surface kinetics of CH4 reactions on Ni, Cu and Cu-Ni surfaces shows good agreement with the experimental results for different growth pressures (0.1 to 0.7 mbar), temperatures (600 to 1200 °C) and different Ni thicknesses (25-500 μm). Also, the model works well when substrates with various C solubilities are used. The thermodynamic and kinetic models described here can be used for the design of improved reactors to optimise the production of graphene with differing qualities, either single or multi-layer and sizes. More importantly, the transfer to a continuous process with a moving substrate should also be possible using the model if it is extended from 2D to 3D.","Al-Hilfi, Samir H; Derby, Brian; Martin, Philip A; Whitehead, J Christopher",Nanoscale,315,1

The primary aim of this systematic review was to document and address the inconsistency in measuring and operationalising education in dementia studies. A secondary aim was to consider the dose of education required to reduce dementia risk. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO with registration ID CRD42018096168. CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Pubmed databases were searched using terms related to education, dementia and/or MCI, and incidence. Studies were eligible for inclusion if a risk ratio for education and any dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Vascular Dementia (VaD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) was reported in a population cognitively healthy at baseline. Sample sizes for 65 studies meeting selection criteria ranged from 152 to 12,881, representing populations from 24 countries. Risk of bias, assessed using a tool designed specifically for dementia risk studies, was found to be medium or low for all studies. There were 23 continuous, 29 dichotomous, and 31 categorical operationalisations of education reported. Random effects meta-analyses from continuous operationalisations suggested each year of education reduced risk by eight percent for AD (95% CI:5-12%) and seven percent for any dementia (95% CI:6-9%). Dichotomous operationalisations indicated an increased risk for low education of 45% (95% CI:29-63%) for any dementia and 85% (95% CI:56-118%) for AD, however definitions of low education were heterogeneous, ranging from zero to 12 years. There were too few studies to produce summary ratios for VaD or MCI. We conclude that, while the evidence of an association between low education and dementia incidence is robust, inconsistency in the definition, measurement and operationalisation of education hinders the translation of this evidence into practical policy recommendations to reduce dementia risk.","Maccora, Janet; Peters, Ruth; Anstey, Kaarin J",SSM - population health,315,19

We recently encountered this in the management of 2 patients with effort-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and offer a treatment paradigm for consideration. CASE REPORTS A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSION The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.","Mukherjee, Dipankar; Kittner, Janine",Vascular and endovascular surgery,315,1

METHOD AND RESULT Each source reviewed was classified as one of the five types-opinion pieces/essays, cross-sectional empirical investigations, nonrandomized comparative investigations, randomized studies, and policy review essays-and into nine content categories: nature engagement and outdoor views; family accommodations; intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal ICU, and pediatric ICU spatial configuration and amenity; noise considerations; artificial and natural lighting; patient safety and infection control; portable critical care field hospitals and disaster mitigation facilities including COVID-19; ecological sustainability; and recent planning and design trends and prognostications. CONCLUSIONS Among the findings embodied in the 135 literature sources reviewed, single-bed ICU rooms have increasingly become the norm; family engagement in the ICU experience has increased; acknowledgment of the therapeutic role of staff amenities; exposure to nature, view, and natural daylight has increased; the importance of ecological sustainability; and pandemic concerns have increased significantly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussion of the results of this comprehensive review includes topics noticeably overlooked or underinvestigated in the 2005-2020 period and priorities for future research.","Verderber, Stephen; Gray, Seth; Suresh-Kumar, Shivathmikha; Kercz, Damian; Parshuram, Christopher",HERD,315,1

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is still a great demand for point-of-care tests for detection, epidemic prevention and epidemiological investigation, both now and after the epidemic. We present a lateral flow immunoassay kit based on a selenium nanoparticle-modified SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, which detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum, and the results can be read by the naked eye in 10 minutes. We expressed and purified the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in HEK293 cells, with a purity of 98.14% and a concentration of 5 mg mL-1. Selenium nanoparticles were synthesized by l-ascorbic acid reduction of seleninic acid at room temperature. After conjugation with the nucleoprotein, a lateral flow kit was successfully prepared. The IgM and IgG detection limits of the lateral flow kit reached 20 ng mL-1 and 5 ng mL-1, respectively, in human serum. A clinical study sample comprising 90 COVID-19-diagnosed patients and 263 non-infected controls was used to demonstrate a sensitivity and specificity of 93.33% and 97.34%, respectively, based on RT-PCR and clinical results. No cross-reactions with rheumatoid factor and positive serum for anti-nuclear antibodies, influenza A, and influenza B were observed. Moreover, the lateral flow kit remained stable after storage for 30 days at 37 °C. Our results demonstrate that the selenium nanoparticle lateral flow kit can conveniently, rapidly, and sensitively detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in human serum and blood; it can also be suitable for the epidemiological investigation of COVID-19.","Wang, Zhizeng; Zheng, Zhi; Hu, Hangzhan; Zhou, Qianwen; Liu, Wei; Li, Xiaoquan; Liu, Zhigang; Wang, Yaohui; Ma, Yuanfang",Lab on a chip,315,1

Concerns surrounding LUS include the disparity of infected patients and healthcare providers, and importantly, the requirement for substantial physical contact between the patient and operator, increasing the risk of transmission. New variants of COVID-19 will continue to emerge; therefore, mitigation of the virus's spread is of paramount importance. A tele-operative robotic ultrasound platform capable of performing LUS in COVID-19 infected patients may be of significant benefit, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The authors address the issues mentioned above surrounding the use of LUS in COVID-19 infected patients and the potential for extension of this technology in a resource-limited environment. Additionally, first-time application, feasibility, and safety were validated in healthy subjects.

The vast majority of prescription drug spending is on brand name drugs, which are protected from typical market pressures by FDA exclusivity and intellectual property patents. Drugs to treat ""orphan"" diseases, of particular relevance to neuromuscular clinicians, are some of the most expensive in all of medicine. The Orphan Drug Act's original intent was to incentivize the creation of drugs that would otherwise provide little economic payoff. While it has facilitated incredible, life-changing drugs for our patients, it has also become a source of abuse. Many expensive drugs approved under the Orphan Drug Act were previously available for compassionate use or for another indication at much lower prices. As patients increasingly face high drug prices, it is important for clinicians to understand a drug's risk for inducing financial toxicity, as the financial and emotional consequences of an overpriced low-value drug may outweigh its intended benefit.","Burns, Ted M; Crowell, Jason L; Smith, A Gordon",Muscle & nerve,315,19

There are few large series that describe laparoscopic surgery for PNET. The primary aim of this study was to describe the feasibility, outcome, and histopathology associated with laparoscopic pancreatic surgery (LS) of PNET in a large series. METHODS All patients with PNET who underwent LS at a single hospital from March 1997 to April 2011 were included retrospectively in the study. RESULTS A total of 72 patients with PNET underwent 75 laparoscopic procedures, out of which 65 were laparoscopic resections or enucleations. The median operative time of all patients who underwent resections or enucleations was 175 (60-520) min, the median blood loss was 300 (5-2700) ml, and the median length of hospital stay was 7 (2-27) days. The overall morbidity rate was 42%, with a surgical morbidity rate of 21% and postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) formation in 21%. Laparoscopic enucleations were associated with a higher rate of POPF than were laparoscopic resections. Five-year disease-specific survival rate was 90%. The T stage, R stage, and a Ki-67 cutoff value of 5% significantly predicted 5-year survival. CONCLUSION LS of PNET is feasible with acceptable morbidity and a good overall disease-specific long-term prognosis.","Haugvik, Sven-Petter; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Røsok, Bård Ingvald; Pomianowska, Ewa; Gladhaug, Ivar Prydz; Mathisen, Oystein; Edwin, Bjørn",World journal of surgery,315,31

SF soldiers make up a disproportionate 60% of all Special Operations casualties. The objective of this study was to better understand SCI incidence in the SF, its mechanisms of acquisition, and potential areas for intervention by addressing key issues pertaining to protective equipment and body armor use. METHODS An electronic survey questionnaire was formulated with the close collaboration of US board-certified neurosurgeons from the Mount Sinai Hospital and Cleveland Clinic Departments of Neurosurgery, retired military personnel of the SF, and operational staff of the Green Beret Foundation. The survey was sent to approximately 6000 SF soldiers to understand SCI diagnosis and its associations with various health and military variables. RESULTS The response rate was 8.2%. Among the 492 respondents, 94 (19.1%) self-reported an SCI diagnosis. An airborne operation was the most commonly attributed cause (54.8%). Moreover, 87.1% of SF soldiers reported wearing headgear at the time of injury, but only 36.6% reported wearing body armor, even though body armor use has significantly increased in post-9/11 SF soldiers compared with that in their pre-9/11 counterparts. SCI was significantly associated with traumatic brain injury, arthritis, low sperm count, low testosterone, erectile dysfunction, tinnitus, hyperacusis, sleep apnea, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Only 16.5% of SF soldiers diagnosed with SCI had been rescued via medical evacuation (medevac) for treatment. CONCLUSIONS A high number of SF soldiers self-reported an SCI diagnosis. Airborne operations landings were the leading cause of SCI, which coincided with warfare tactics employed during the Persian Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other conflicts. A majority of SCIs occurred while wearing headgear and no body armor, suggesting the need for improvements in protective equipment use and design. The low rate of medevac rescue for these injuries may suggest that medical rescue was not attainable at the time or that certain SCIs were deemed minor at the time of injury.","Kessler, Remi A; Bhammar, Ansh; Lakomkin, Nikita; Shrivastava, Raj K; Rasouli, Jonathan J; Steinberger, Jeremy; Bederson, Joshua; Hadjipanayis, Constantinos G; Benzil, Deborah L",Journal of neurosurgery.

Its underlying pathophysiology, however, is unknown. In this study, we assessed cognitive profiles and regional cerebral glucose metabolism as a biomarker of neuronal function in outpatients suffering from long-term neurocognitive symptoms after COVID-19. Methods: Outpatients seeking neurological counseling with neurocognitive symptoms persisting for more than three months after polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 were included prospectively between June 16, 2020, and January 29, 2021. Patients (n = 31, 54±2.0 years) in the long-term phase after COVID-19 (202±58 days after positive PCR) were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. Cerebral 18F-FDG PET imaging was performed in 14/31 patients. Results: Patients self-reported impaired attention, memory, and multitasking abilities (31/31), word-finding difficulties (27/31), and fatigue (24/31). Twelve of 31 patients could not return to the previous level of independence/employment. For all cognitive domains, average group results of the neuropsychological test-battery showed no impairment, but deficits (z-score<-1.5) were present on single-patient level mainly in the domain of visual memory (in 7/31; other domains ≤2/31). Mean MoCA performance (27/30 points) was above the cutoff-value for detection of cognitive impairment (< 26 points), although 9/31 patients performed slightly below this level (23-25 points). In the subgroup of patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET, we found no significant changes of regional cerebral glucose metabolism. Conclusion: Long COVID patients self-report uniform symptoms hampering their ability to work in a relevant fraction. However, cognitive testing showed minor impairments only on single-patient level approximately six months after the infection, whereas functional imaging revealed no distinct pathological changes. This clearly deviates from previous findings in subacute COVID-19 patients, suggesting that underlying neuronal causes are different and possibly related to the high prevalence of fatigue.","Dressing, Andrea; Bormann, Tobias; Blazhenets, Ganna; Schroeter, Nils; Walter, Lea I; Thurow, Johannes; August, Dietrich; Hilger, Hanna; Stete, Katarina; Gerstacker, Kathrin; Arndt, Susan; Rau, Alexander; Urbach, Horst; Rieg, Siegbert; Wagner, Dirk; Weiller, Cornelius; Meyer, Philipp T; Hosp, Jonas A","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",315,28

In this work, Taniaphos, a chiral ligand with rotatable spatial configuration, was employed as a chiral extractant to enantioseparate various amino acid enantiomers. Phenylalanine (Phe), homophenylalanine (Hphe), 4-nitrophenylalanine (Nphe), and 3-chloro-phenylglycine (Cpheg) were used as substrates to evaluate the extraction efficiency. The results revealed that Taniaphos-Cu exhibited good abilities to enantioseparate Phe, Hphe, Nphe, and Cpheg with the highest separation factors (α) of 3.13, 2.10, 2.32, and 2.14, respectively. Taniaphos-Cu is more conducive to combine with D-amino acid in extraction. The influences of pH, Taniaphos-Cu, and concentration and extraction temperature on extraction were comprehensively evaluated. The highest performance factors (pf) for Phe, Hphe, Nphe, and Cpheg at optimal extraction conditions were 0.08892, 0.1250, 0.09621, and 0.08021, respectively. The recognition mechanism between Taniaphos-Cu and amino acid enantiomers was discussed. The coordination interaction between Taniaphos-Cu and COO- , π-π interaction between Taniaphos-Cu and amino acid enantiomers are important acting forces in chiral extraction. The steric-hindrance between NH2 and OH lead to Taniaphos-Cu-D-Phe is more stable than Taniaphos-Cu-L-Phe.

This essay presents historical context for the colonial inheritance of modern global health and analyses two controversies related to COVID-19 that illustrate facets of coloniality: comments made by French researchers regarding the testing of BCG vaccine in Africa, and the claims by Madagascar's president Andry Rajoelina that the country had developed an effective traditional remedy named Covid-Organics. Leveraging both historical sources and contemporary documentary sources, I demonstrate how the currents of exploitation, marginalisation, pathologisation and saviourism rooted in coloniality are manifested via these events. I also discuss responses to coloniality, focussing on the misuse and co-optation of pan-Africanist rhetoric. In particular, I argue that the scandal surrounding Covid-Organics is a reflection of endogenised coloniality, whereby local elites entrench and benefit from inequitable power structures at the intersubjective (rather than trans-national) scale.

METHODS This is a mono-centric analysis of perioperative data from 48 consecutive patients undergoing robot-assisted cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion and robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis. Data include the preoperative variables, operative and postoperative course and complication rates related to bowel anastomosis. End points were time spent for anastomosis and intra- and postoperative complication rates. RESULTS Median operating time was 23.0 (13-60) min for the ileoileal anastomosis. Median overall operating time was 295 (200-780) min, with a median of 282 (200-418) min and 414.0 (225-780) min for the ileum conduit (N = 35) and ileal neobladder (N = 13). Two patients developed paralytic ileus; in another patient acute peritonitis occurred, but was caused by urinary leakage and therefore unrelated to the bowel anastomosis. No anastomotic leakage was noticed. Costs for the robot-sewn anastomosis was 8€ compared to 1250€ for a stapled anastomosis which was performed in previous cases. Limitations are the non-comparative nature of the analysis and the limited number of patients. CONCLUSIONS Robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis is feasible with low complication rates. Compared to the stapled anastomosis, a robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis may serve as an alternative and cost-saving approach.","Loertzer, P; Siemer, S; Stöckle, M; Ohlmann, C H",World journal of urology,315,28

Diseases can be controlled and even eradicated based on the epidemiology and effective prophylaxis, which often depends on development of efficient diagnostics. In addition, combating newly emerging diseases in human as well as animal healthcare is challenging and is dependent on developing safe and efficient diagnostics. Detection of antibodies directed against specific antigens has been the method of choice for documenting prior infection. Other than zoonosis, development of inexpensive vaccines and diagnostics is a unique problem in animal healthcare. The advent of recombinant DNA technology and its application in the biotechnology industry has revolutionized animal healthcare. The use of recombinant DNA technology in animal disease diagnosis has improved the rapidity, specificity and sensitivity of various diagnostic assays. This is because of the absence of host cellular proteins in the recombinant derived antigen preparations that dramatically decrease the rate of false-positive reactions.

METHODS From March 2012 to June 2015, 178 consecutive patients (mean age 65.2±5.8 years; 124 men) with symptoms of atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar ischemia underwent angiography prior to stent implantation in the vertebral, subclavian, and/or carotid arteries. In this cohort, 54 patients (mean age 67.3±5.3 years; 40 men) had VAO stent implantation. Angiography of the vertebral artery was recorded in 2 phases with breath-hold: deep inspiration (DIP) and deep expiration (DEP). Obvious VAO tortuosity was defined as any VAO angle ≤120° in DIP. Obvious VAO-DRT was defined as any VAO angle increasing ≥60° from DIP to DEP. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography was used in follow-up to detect ISR and stent fracture. RESULTS Of the 178 patients in this study, 21 (11.8%) had obvious VAO tortuosity and 8 (4.5%) had obvious VAO-DRT. Two of the 21 patients with obvious VAO tortuosity also had obvious VAO-DRT. Three of the 54 VAO stent patients had VAO-DRT. There were no correlations between VAO-DRT and age, sex, risk factors, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or obvious VAO tortuosity (p>0.05). Over a mean follow-up of 28±10 months, there were 4 (7.4%) asymptomatic VAO ISR cases. Two (3.7%) were occlusions at 6 and 12 months, respectively; both were associated with stent fracture in patients with obvious VAO-DRT before stenting. Both stents fractured at the tortuous VAO region. VAO-DRT was correlated with stent fracture (Spearman ρ=0.81, p<0.01) and ISR (Spearman ρ=0.55, p<0.01). CONCLUSION VAO-DRT could be a risk factor for stent fracture and restenosis after VAO stent implantation. Angiography in both inspiration and expiration phases, especially the latter, should be considered before VAO stenting. Using a shorter stent to avoid crossing the tortuosity could reduce the occurrence of fracture.","Tang, Xiaobin; Tang, Feng; Hu, Chang; Wang, Qian; Long, Whitney; Li, Lei",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,315,1

With the failure of non-surgical strategies, bariatric surgery has emerged as the most effective therapeutic option for the treatment of severe obesity. Among various surgical options, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results in sustained weight loss and profound metabolic improvements. The traditional view that gastric bypass and bariatric surgery in general works primarily through restriction/malabsorption of nutrients has become obsolete. It is now increasingly recognised that its mechanisms of action are primarily physiologic, not mechanic. In fact, clinical and translational studies over the last decade have shown that a number of gastrointestinal mechanisms, including changes in gut hormones, neural signalling, intestinal flora, bile acid and lipid metabolism can play a significant role in the effects of this procedure on energy homeostasis. The clinical efficacy and mechanisms of action of RYGB provide a compelling evidence for the role of the gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of appetite and satiety, body weight and glucose metabolism. This review discusses the physiologic changes that occur after RYGB and that contribute to its mechanisms of action.","Chakravartty, Saurav; Tassinari, Daniele; Salerno, Angelo; Giorgakis, Emmanouil; Rubino, Francesco",Current obesity reports,315,31

Although Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory tract infection, there is growing evidence that other organs including the cardiovascular system are affected by COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the association of myocardial injury with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we discuss potential mechanisms of myocardial injury including myocarditis and vascular thrombosis. Last, we review the current evidence on drugs which have been evaluated or are currently tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Weckbach, Ludwig T; Kellnar, Antonia; Stremmel, Christopher; Stark, Konstantin; Kääb, Stefan",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,315,1

METHODS Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2020 were reviewed, including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for specialty drugs, biosimilars, and diabetes medications. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2020 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS In 2019, overall US pharmaceutical expenditures grew 5.4% compared to 2018, for a total of $507.9 billion. This increase was driven to similar degrees by prices, utilization, and new drugs. Adalimumab was the top drug in US expenditures in 2019, followed by apixaban and insulin glargine. Drug expenditures were $36.9 billion (a 1.5% increase from 2018) and $90.3 billion (an 11.8% increase from 2018) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, growth was driven by new products and increased utilization, whereas in hospitals growth was driven by new products and price increases. Several new drugs that will likely influence spending are expected to be approved in 2020. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures. CONCLUSION For 2020 we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 9.0% to 11.0% and 2.0% to 4.0%, respectively, compared to 2019. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.","Tichy, Eric M; Schumock, Glen T; Hoffman, James M; Suda, Katie J; Rim, Matthew H; Tadrous, Mina; Stubbings, JoAnn; Cuellar, Sandra; Clark, John S; Wiest, Michelle D; Matusiak, Linda M; Hunkler, Robert J; Vermeulen, Lee C",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,315,1

The ability of autophagosomal membranes to act selectively toward specific cargo is dependent on the small ubiquitin-like modifier ATG8/LC3 and the LC3-interacting region (LIR) present in autophagy receptors. Here, we describe a comprehensive protein-protein interaction analysis of TBC (Tre2, Bub2, and Cdc16) domain-containing Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) as potential autophagy adaptors. We identified 14 TBC domain-containing Rab GAPs that bind directly to ATG8 modifiers and that colocalize with LC3-positive autophagy membranes in cells. Intriguingly, one of our screening hits, TBC1D5, contains two LIR motifs. The N-terminal LIR was critical for interaction with the retromer complex and transport of cargo. Direct binding of the retromer component VPS29 to TBC1D5 could be titrated out by LC3, indicating a molecular switch between endosomes and autophagy. Moreover, TBC1D5 could bridge the endosome and autophagosome via its C-terminal LIR motif. During starvation-induced autophagy, TBC1D5 was relocalized from endosomal localization to the LC3-positive autophagosomes. We propose that LC3-interacting Rab GAPs are implicated in the reprogramming of the endocytic trafficking events under starvation-induced autophagy.","Popovic, Doris; Akutsu, Masato; Novak, Ivana; Harper, J Wade; Behrends, Christian; Dikic, Ivan",Molecular and cellular biology,315,8

We aim to review the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancer, with an emphasis on the role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) during a pandemic. DATA SOURCES COVID-19 resources from PubMed, Google Scholar, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society were examined. REVIEW METHODS Studies and guidelines related to the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer in the COVID-19 setting were reviewed. A total of 54 studies were included. Given the continuously evolving body of literature, the sources cited include the latest statements from medical and dental societies. RESULTS The unpredictable fluctuation of hospital resources and the risk of the nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 have direct effects on head and neck cancer management. Using an MDT approach to help define ""essential surgery"" for immediately life- or function-threatening disease processes in the context of available hospital resources will help to maximize outcomes. Early enrollment in an MDT is often critical for considering nonsurgical options to protect patients and health care workers. The role of the MDT continues after cancer treatment, if delivered, and the MDT plays an essential role in surveillance and survivorship programs in these challenging times. CONCLUSION Head and neck cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge for all specialists involved. Early MDT involvement is important to maximize patient outcomes and satisfaction in the context of public and community safety.","Han, Albert Y; Miller, Jessa E; Long, Jennifer L; St John, Maie A",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,315,1

Despite many advances in open surgical and endovascular techniques, this subset of patients retains relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, BBAs have been treated with flow-diverting stents such as the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) with overall positive results. METHODS Four patients presented with dissecting internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms treated with the PED (two BBAs presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), two pseudoaneurysms after injury during endoscopic trans-sphenoidal tumor surgery). RESULTS Three patients had a successful angiographic and neurological outcome. One patient with a BBA re-ruptured during initial PED placement, again in the postoperative period, and later died. Primary PED treatment involved telescoping stents in two patients and coil embolization supplementation in one patient. CONCLUSIONS The PED should be used selectively in the setting of acute SAH. Dual antiplatelet therapy can complicate hydrocephalus management, and the lack of immediate aneurysm occlusion creates the risk of short-term re-rupture. PED treatment for iatrogenic ICA pseudoaneurysms can provide a good angiographic and neurological outcome.","Nerva, John D; Morton, Ryan P; Levitt, Michael R; Osbun, Joshua W; Ferreira, Manuel J; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Kim, Louis J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,315,1

They also need to prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase (when pandemic-associated service reductions are eased). Objective To describe a flexible and scalable scoring algorithm for patients with glaucoma that considers glaucoma severity and progression risk vs the presence of high-risk features for morbidity from COVID-19, using information from a large data repository. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma from March 16, 2020, to April 16, 2020, at an academic institution enrolled in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative (SOURCE) Ophthalmology Electronic Health Record Data Repository were identified. A risk stratification tool was developed that calculated a glaucoma severity and progression risk score and a COVID-19 morbidity risk score. These scores were summed to determine a total score for each patient. Main Outcomes and Measures Total scores and percentages of clinic appointments recommended for rescheduling. Results Among the 1034 patients with upcoming clinic appointments for glaucoma, the mean (SD) age was 66.7 (14.6) years. There were 575 women (55.6%), 733 White individuals (71%), and 160 Black individuals (15.5%). The mean (SD) glaucoma severity and progression risk score was 4.0 (14.4) points, the mean (SD) COVID-19 morbidity risk score was 27.2 (16.1) points, and the mean (SD) total score was 31.2 (21.4) points. During pandemic-associated reductions in services, using total score thresholds of 0, 25, and 50 points would identify 970 appointments (93.8%), 668 appointments (64.6%), and 275 appointments (26.6%), respectively, for postponement and rescheduling. The algorithm-generated total scores also helped prioritize appointment rescheduling during the ramp-up phase. Conclusions and Relevance A tool that considers the risk of underlying ophthalmic disease progression from delayed care receipt and the morbidity risk from COVID-19 exposure was developed and implemented, facilitating the triage of upcoming ophthalmic appointments. Comparable approaches for other ophthalmic and nonophthalmic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises may be created using this methodology.","Bommakanti, Nikhil K; Zhou, Yunshu; Ehrlich, Joshua R; Elam, Angela R; John, Denise; Kamat, Shivani S; Kelstrom, Jared; Newman-Casey, Paula Anne; Shah, Manjool M; Weizer, Jennifer S; Wood, Sarah D; Zhang, Amy D; Zhang, Jason; Lee, Paul P; Stein, Joshua D",JAMA ophthalmology,315,17

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for all patients diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis who underwent SAVR with CABG or TAVR with PCI during the years 2016-2017. Study outcomes included all-cause in-hospital mortality, acute stroke, pacemaker insertion, vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, length of stay and cost. Outcomes of hospitalization were modeled using logistic regression for binary outcomes and generalized linear models for continuous outcomes. Overall, 31,205 patients were included (TAVR + PCI=2,185, SAVR + CABG=29,020). In reference to SAVR + CABG, recipients of TAVR + PCI were older with mean age 82 vs 73 years, effect size (d) =0.9, had higher proportions of females 47.6% vs 26.6%, d= 0.4 and higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure. On multivariable analysis, TAVR + PCI was associated with lowers odds for mortality adjusted OR: 0.32 [95%CI: 0.17 - 0.62] p=0.001, lower odds for acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, shorter length of stay and higher odds for vascular complications, need for pacemaker insertion and higher cost. The occurrence of stroke was similar between both groups. In conclusion, results from real-world observational data shows less rates of mortality and periprocedural complications in TAVR + PCI compared to SAVR + CABG.","Abugroun, Ashraf; Osman, Mohammed; Awadalla, Saria; Klein, Lloyd",The American journal of cardiology,315,16

Recent studies have shown that the detection rate of liver lesions is significantly higher in gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) than in contrast-enhanced portal-phase computed tomography (CT); however, the latter remains essential because of its high specificity, good performance in estimating liver volumes and better vessel visibility. To characterize liver lesions using both the above image modalities, we propose a multimodal nonrigid registration framework using organ-focused mutual information (OF-MI). This proposal tries to improve mutual information (MI) based registration by adding spatial information, benefiting from the availability of expert liver segmentation in clinical protocols. The incorporation of an additional information channel containing liver segmentation information was studied. A dataset of real clinical images and simulated images was used in the validation process. A Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI simulation framework is presented. To evaluate results, warping index errors were calculated for the simulated data, and landmark-based and surface-based errors were calculated for the real data. An improvement of the registration accuracy for OF-MI as compared with MI was found for both simulated and real datasets. Statistical significance of the difference was tested and confirmed in the simulated dataset (p<0.01).","Fernandez-de-Manuel, Laura; Wollny, Gert; Kybic, Jan; Jimenez-Carretero, Daniel; Tellado, Jose M; Ramon, Enrique; Desco, Manuel; Santos, Andres; Pascau, Javier; Ledesma-Carbayo, Maria J",Medical image analysis,315,1

This approach improves on the sensitivity of current DNA-responsive materials while enabling their rapid repurposing toward new sequence targets. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource for the design, synthesis and actuation of CRISPR-responsive hydrogels.

Bismuth drugs have been used to treat gastrointestinal disorder and Helicobacter pylori infection for decades without exerting acute toxicity. They were found to interact with a wide variety of biomolecules, but the major metabolic pathway remains unknown. For the first time (to our knowledge), we systematically and quantitatively studied the metabolism of bismuth in human cells. Our data demonstrated that over 90% of bismuth was passively absorbed, conjugated to glutathione, and transported into vesicles by MRP transporter. Mathematical modeling of the system reveals an interesting phenomenon. Passively absorbed bismuth consumes intracellular glutathione, which therefore activates de novo biosynthesis of glutathione. Reciprocally, sequestration by glutathione facilitates the passive uptake of bismuth and thus completes a self-sustaining positive feedback circle. This mechanism robustly removes bismuth from both intra- and extracellular space, protecting critical systems of human body from acute toxicity. It elucidates the selectivity of bismuth drugs between human and pathogens that lack of glutathione, such as Helicobacter pylori, opening new horizons for further drug development.","Hong, Yifan; Lai, Yau-Tsz; Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung; Sun, Hongzhe",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,315,1

Because of the numerous potential modes of transmission, surgeons and all procedural staff represent a unique population that requires standardized procedures to protect themselves and their patients. Although several protocols have been implemented during other infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus, no standardized protocol has been published in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of two surgeons, an anesthesiologist, and an infection preventionist was assembled to create a process with sterile attire adapted from the National Emerging Special Pathogen Training and Education Center (NETEC) donning and doffing process. After editing, a donning procedure and doffing procedure was created and made into checklists. The procedures were simulated in an empty operating room (OR) with simulation of all personnel roles. A ""dofficer"" role was established to ensure real-time adherence to the procedures. Results: The donning and doffing procedures were printed as one-page documents for easy posting in ORs and procedural areas. Pictures from the simulation were also obtained and made into flow chart-style diagrams that were also posted in the ORs.

A thoracoscopic esophagectomy may minimize injury to the chest wall and reduce surgical invasiveness. Conventional thoracoscopic procedures are performed in the left lateral-decubitus position. Recently, procedures performed in the prone position have received more attention because of improvements in operative exposure or surgeon ergonomics. However, the efficacy of the prone position in an aggressive thoracoscopic esophagectomy with an extensive lymphadenectomy has not been fully documented. METHODS We successfully performed a thoracoscopic esophagectomy with a three-field extensive lymphadenectomy in 43 esophageal carcinoma patients in the prone position from December 2007 to December 2009. We describe our procedures with the patients in the prone position, focusing especially on a lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve where the nodes are frequently involved and precise dissection is technically challenging. To determine further the advantages of this position, we retrospectively compared surgical outcomes in 43 patients to those of 34 patients who underwent a thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left lateral decubitus position as a historical control from January 2006 to November 2007. RESULTS It was easier to explore the operative field around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve during a thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position. The mean duration of the aggressive thoracoscopic procedure in the prone position was 307 min, which was significantly longer than in the left lateral decubitus position, but the total estimated blood loss in the prone position was significantly lower.

In contrast, the widely spread human coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63 tend to cause only mild symptoms. The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by MHC class I. A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus. For inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens. Therefore, for the discussion on vaccination strategies against COVID-19, the available immune memory against related viruses should be part of the consideration.","Dijkstra, Johannes M; Hashimoto, Keiichiro",F1000Research,315,30

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts to minimize spread may have improved hospitalized children's sleep by decreasing unnecessary overnight disruptions. This study aimed to describe the impact of these efforts on pediatric inpatient sleep using objective and subjective metrics. METHODS Sleep disruptions for pediatric inpatients admitted prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared. Hand hygiene sensors tracking room entries were utilized to measure objective overnight disruptions for 69 nights pre-pandemic and 154 pandemic nights. Caregiver surveys of overnight disruptions, sleep quantity, and caregiver mood were adopted from validated tools: the Karolinska Sleep Log, Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood Scale. RESULTS Nighttime room entries initially decreased 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%, p < 0.001), then returned towards baseline, mirroring the COVID-19 hospital census. However, surveyed caregivers (n_pre = 293, n_post = 154) reported more disrupted sleep (p < 0.001) due to tests (21% vs. 38%), anxiety (23% vs. 41%), and pain (23% vs. 48%). Caregivers also reported children slept 61 fewer minutes (95% CI: -12 min, -110 min, p < 0.001). Caregivers self-reported feeling more sad, weary, and worse overall (p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS Despite a decrease in objective room entries during the pandemic, caregivers reported their children were disrupted more and slept less. Caregivers also self-reported worse mood. This highlights the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on subjective experiences of hospitalized children and their caregivers. Future work targeting stress and anxiety could improve pediatric inpatient sleep.","Riehm, Joseph M; Arora, Vineet M; Tatineni, Swetha; Erondu, Amarachi; Mozer, Christine L; Cook, David J; Byron, Maxx; Mordell, Lisa; Ye, Fanheng; Orlov, Nicola M",Sleep medicine,315,0

A licensed vaccine for dengue viruses has become a global health priority. A major challenge to developing a dengue vaccine is the necessity to produce fairly uniform protective immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes. We have developed two bivalent dengue virus vaccines, using a complex adenovirus vector, by incorporating the genes expressing premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of dengue virus types 1 and 2 (dengue-1 and -2, respectively) (CAdVax-Den12) or dengue-3 and -4 (CAdVax-Den34). Rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular inoculation of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulated by combining the two bivalent vaccine constructs. Vaccinated animals produced high-titer antibodies that neutralized all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. The ability of the vaccine to induce rapid, as well as sustained, protective immune responses was examined with two separate live-virus challenges administered at 4 and 24 weeks after the final vaccination. For both of these virus challenge studies, significant protection from viremia was demonstrated for all four dengue virus serotypes in vaccinated animals. Viremia from dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges was completely blocked, whereas viremia from dengue-2 and dengue-4 was significantly reduced, as well as delayed, compared to that of control-vaccinated animals. These results demonstrate that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four dengue virus serotypes.","Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Wang, Danher; Ewing, Dan; Holman, David H; Block, Karla; Woraratanadharm, Jan; Chen, Lan; Hayes, Curtis; Dong, John Y; Porter, Kevin",Journal of virology,315,12

Some zoonoses have been associated with the pig and pork industry. To ensure the safety of pigs and pork and to improve public health it is essential to understand the level of knowledge of those affiliated with the swine industry. The purpose of our study was to assess the knowledge of and attitude toward zoonotic and other microbial hazards among targeted groups of stakeholders associated with the Ontario swine industry. A postal questionnaire was sent to 409 individuals representing producers, veterinarians, and allied industry personnel. The questionnaire included seven dichotomous and Likert-scale type questions on microbial hazards, addressing topics on familiarity, concern, presence, antimicrobial resistance, and knowledge transfer. The overall response rate was 53% (218/409). More respondents were concerned about the zoonotic potential of Salmonella spp. (53-94%) and swine influenza virus (64-75%) than other hazards. The group of veterinarians were more familiar (>89%) with all microbial hazards than other occupation groups. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance was reported as a problem by more (60%) veterinarians than producers (20%).

There has been limited investigation into the reliability of this score. We aim to identify intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the mTICI score among endovascular neurosurgeons. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four independent endovascular neurosurgeons (raters) reviewed angiograms of 67 patients at 2 time points. κ statistics assessed inter- and intrarater reliability and compared raters'-versus-proceduralists' scores. Reliability was also assessed for occlusion location and by dichotomizing modified TICI scores (0-2a versus 2b-3). RESULTS Interrater reliability was moderate-to-substantial, weighted κ = 0.417-0.703, overall κ = 0.374 (P < .001). The dichotomized modified TICI score had moderate-to-substantial interrater agreement, κ statistics = 0.468-0.715, overall κ = 0.582 (P < .001). Intrarater reliability was moderate-to-almost perfect, weighted κ = 0.594-0.81. The dichotomized modified TICI score had substantial-to-almost perfect reliability, κ = 0.632-0.82. Proceduralists had fair-to-moderate agreement with raters, weighted κ = 0.348-0.574, and the dichotomized modified TICI score had fair-to-moderate agreement, κ = 0.365-0.544. When proceduralists and raters disagreed, proceduralists' scores were higher in 79.6% of cases. M1 followed by ICA occlusions had the highest agreement. CONCLUSIONS The modified TICI score is a practical metric for assessing reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy, though not without limitations. Agreement improved when scores were dichotomized around the clinically relevant threshold of successful revascularization. Interrater reliability improved with time, suggesting that formal training of interventionalists may improve reporting reliability. Agreement of the modified TICI scale is best with M1 and ICA occlusion and becomes less reliable with more distal or posterior circulation occlusions. These findings should be considered when developing research trials.","Heiferman, D M; Pecoraro, N C; Wozniak, A W; Ebersole, K C; Jimenez, L M; Reynolds, M R; Ringer, A J; Serrone, J C",AJNR.

Imaging examinations revealed a right-sided esophageal diverticulum located about 10cm above the esophagogastric junction. High-resolution manometry revealed normal esophageal motility. However, 24-h pH monitoring revealed continuous acidity due to pooling of residue in the diverticulum. An esophageal epiphrenic diverticulum was diagnosed and resected thoracoscopically. Her dysphagia recurred 2 years later. High-resolution manometry revealed diffuse esophageal spasm.

We explored subjects' COPD knowledge, including education they receive from health care providers, treatment experiences, and practices with inhalation devices. METHODS A multiple-choice online survey, developed by a steering committee of American Thoracic Society clinicians and scientists, was administered to subjects with COPD who were sourced from the Harris Poll Online panel. RESULTS Of the 254 respondents (mean age 61.8 y; 49% males), most subjects (82%) claimed to understand their disease and available treatments, yet COPD symptoms and causes were well known to only 45% and 44% of subjects, respectively. Forty-three percent of subjects had ever used a pressurized metered-dose inhaler or dry-powder inhaler. Of the 54% of subjects who had ever used a small-volume nebulizer (SVN), 63% considered this device to be easy to use, 55% considered it to be fast-acting, 53% considered it to be convenient, and 38% considered it to be essential for treatment. Among subjects who had ever used them, SVNs were preferred by 54% over other devices. One third of subjects desired more extensive education during office visits; 25% felt the time was insufficient to cover questions, and 15% felt their concerns about COPD treatment(s) were ignored. Subjects believed physicians (32%), nurses (26%), and no single provider (28%) were primarily responsible for training and assessing proper inhalation technique. CONCLUSION The survey showed differences between patients' beliefs and knowledge of COPD; the need for continuous education from health care providers, particularly on inhalation devices; and extensive use of pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers despite positive perceptions of SVNs.","Dhand, Rajiv; Mahler, Donald A; Carlin, Brian W; Hanania, Nicola A; Ohar, Jill A; Pinto-Plata, Victor; Shah, Tina; Eubanks, David; Braman, Sidney S",Respiratory care,315,1

By contrast, NIV may have deleterious effects in nonimmunocompromised patients and experts have been unable to offer a recommendation. Immunocompromised patients have particularly high mortality rates when they require intubation. However, it is not clear whether immunosuppression status is a risk factor for NIV failure. We assessed the impact of immunosuppression status on NIV failure in a post hoc analysis pooling two studies including patients with de novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with NIV. Patients with hypercapnia, acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or with do-not-intubate order were excluded. RESULTS Among the 208 patients included in the analysis, 71 (34%) were immunocompromised. They had higher severity scores upon ICU admission, higher pressure-support levels, and minute ventilation under NIV, and were more likely to have bilateral lung infiltrates than nonimmunocompromised patients. Intubation and in-ICU mortality rates were higher in immunocompromised than in nonimmunocompromised patients: 61% vs. 43% (p = 0.02) and 38% vs. 15% (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjustment or using a propensity score-matched analysis, immunosuppression was not associated with intubation, whereas it remained independently associated with ICU mortality with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.64 (95% CI 1.24-5.67, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Immunosuppression status may directly influence mortality but does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of intubation in patients with de novo acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with NIV.

We evaluated the short- and long-term outcome of this procedure. METHODS From January 1995 to October 2011, 34 patients (30 males and 4 females; mean age: 61.8 years) underwent pneumonectomy with en bloc chest wall resection for 33 non-small-cell lung cancer and 1 metastatic osteosarcoma in two institutions. Data were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Operative (30-day) mortality was 2.9% (1 of 34), and morbidity was 38.2% (13 of 34). There were 14 (41.1%) right-side procedures and 20 (58.8%) left-side procedures. Three (8.8%) patients developed bronchopleural fistulas. The mean number of resected ribs per patient was 2.7 ± 1.1. In 13 (38.2%) patients, a prosthetic reconstruction of the chest wall was needed. In 3 (8.8%) cases, the bronchial step was buttressed. Preoperative pain was statistically significantly related to the depth of chest wall invasion (P = 0.026). The N status was N0 in 18 (52.9%) cases, N1 in 9 (26.4%), N2 in 6 (17.6%) and Nx in 1 (metastatic osteosarcoma). Patients were followed-up for a total of 979 months. The median survival was 40 months. The overall 5-year survival was 46.8% (± 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2-0.6): 45.2 (± 95% CI: 0.03-0.8) for right-side and 48.4% (± 95% CI: 0.2-0.7) for left-side procedures, respectively. According to the N status, the 5-year survival was 59.7 (± 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) in N0, 55.5 (± 95% CI: 0.06-1) in N1 and 16.6% (± 95% CI: 0-0.4) in N2. The subgroup N0 plus N1 (27 patients) showed a 58.08% (± 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) 5-year survival compared with 16.6% (± 95% CI: 0-0.4) in N2 (χ(2): 3.7; P = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS Pneumonectomy with en bloc chest wall reconstruction can be safely offered to selected patients. The addition of en bloc chest wall resection to pneumonectomy does not affect operative mortality and morbidity compared with standard pneumonectomy. The pivotal additional effect of the chest wall resection should not be considered a contraindication for such procedures. Survival showed a clinically relevant difference by comparing N0 plus N1 with N2 (58.1 vs 16.6%), not confirmed by the statistical analysis (P = 0.053).","Cardillo, Giuseppe; Spaggiari, Lorenzo; Galetta, Domenico; Carleo, Francesco; Carbone, Luigi; Morrone, Aldo; Ricci, Alberto; Facciolo, Francesco; Martelli, Massimo",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,315,12

This investigation showed that polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles have genetic, enzymatic and morphological effects on Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. An RT-PCR analysis showed increases in the expression of esterase and hydrolase genes at 5 days of exposure to polyethylene nanoparticles and at 10 days of exposure to polyethylene microparticles.

There is need to move beyond supervised assessments in the laboratory/clinic. Longitudinal free-living assessment can provide a wealth of information on patient pathology and habitual behaviour, but cost and complexity of equipment have typically been a barrier. Lack of supervised conditions within free-living assessment means there is need to augment these studies with environmental analysis to provide context to individual measurements. This paper reviews low-cost and accessible Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with the aim of informing biomedical engineers of possibilities, workflows and limitations they present. In doing so, we evidence their use within healthcare research through literature and experimentation. As hardware becomes more affordable and feature rich, the cost of data magnifies. This can be limiting for biomedical engineers exploring low-cost solutions as data costs can make IoT approaches unscalable. IoT technologies can be exploited by biomedical engineers, but more research is needed before these technologies can become commonplace for clinicians and healthcare practitioners. It is hoped that the insights provided by this paper will better equip biomedical engineers to lead and monitor multi-disciplinary research investigations.","Coulby, G; Clear, A; Jones, O; Young, F; Stuart, S; Godfrey, A",Biomedical engineering online,315,1

In the present analysis, we compared characteristics of diffusion-weighted MRI lesions. METHODS Number, individual and total volumes, and location of new diffusion-weighted MRI lesions were compared in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis randomized to CAS (n=124) or CEA (n=107) in the ICSS-MRI substudy. RESULTS CAS patients had higher lesion numbers than CEA patients (1 lesion, 15% vs 8%; 2-5 lesions, 19% vs 5%; >5 lesions, 16% vs 4%). The overall risk ratio for the expected lesion count with CAS versus CEA was 8.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.4-17.5; P<0.0001) and significantly increased among patients with lower blood pressure at randomization, diabetes mellitus, stroke as the qualifying event, left-side stenosis, and if patients were treated at centers routinely using filter-type protection devices during CAS. Individual lesions were smaller in the CAS group than in the CEA group (P<0.0001). Total lesion volume per patient did not differ significantly. Lesions in the CAS group were more likely to occur in cortical areas and subjacent white matter supplied by leptomeningeal arteries than lesions in the CEA group (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-10.2; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Compared with patients undergoing CEA, patients treated with CAS had higher numbers of periprocedural ischemic brain lesions, and lesions were smaller and more likely to occur in cortical areas and subjacent white matter. These findings may reflect differences in underlying mechanisms of cerebral ischemia.","Gensicke, Henrik; Zumbrunn, Thomas; Jongen, Lisa M; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Macdonald, Sumaira; Gaines, Peter A; Lyrer, Philippe A; Wetzel, Stephan G; van der Lugt, Aad; Mali, Willem P Th M; Brown, Martin M; van der Worp, H Bart; Engelter, Stefan T; Bonati, Leo H",Stroke,315,14

In clinical trials, DSA and CTA are 2 imaging modalities commonly used to assess collateral flow. We aimed to determine the agreement between collateral flow assessment on CTA and DSA and their respective associations with clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients randomized in MR CLEAN with middle cerebral artery occlusion and both baseline CTA images and complete DSA runs were included. Collateral flow on CTA and DSA was graded 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Quadratic weighted κ statistics determined agreement between both methods. The association of both modalities with mRS at 90 days was assessed. Also, association between the dichotomized collateral score and mRS 0-2 (functional independence) was ascertained. RESULTS Of 45 patients with evaluable imaging data, collateral flow was graded on CTA as 0, 1, 2, 3 for 3, 10, 20, and 12 patients, respectively, and on DSA for 12, 17, 10, and 6 patients, respectively. The κ-value was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.16-0.32). The overall proportion of agreement was 24% (95% CI, 0.12-0.38). The adjusted odds ratio for favorable outcome on mRS was 2.27 and 1.29 for CTA and DSA, respectively. The relationship between the dichotomized collateral score and mRS 0-2 was significant for CTA (P = .01), but not for DSA (P = .77). CONCLUSIONS Commonly applied collateral flow assessment on CTA and DSA showed large differences, indicating that these techniques are not interchangeable.

During this period children have to stay indoors, which might probably increase their exposures to indoor allergens and pollutants. Besides, reduced exposures to respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollutants might be favorable outcomes of this lockdown period. We evaluated the effects of the lockdown on house dust mite (HDM) sensitized children with respiratory allergies. METHODS Three-month clinical and medication data of 165 mild-moderate asthmatic children with or without allergic rhinitis (AR), who were grouped according to their HDM sensitization status were retrieved from patient records. Demographics, asthma control tests, nasal visual analog scores and outdoor air-quality monitoring data were used for assessments in comparisons to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS Eighty-four patients had asthma and 81 patients had asthma with AR. Sensitization to HDM was present in 61.8% of the children. Patients experienced reduced numbers of upper-respiratory tract infections (p=0.008) and reduced asthma exacerbations (p<0.001) compared to the same period in the previous year. Asthma control tests were significantly improved (p<0.001) and cumulative inhaled corticosteroid usages were significantly reduced (p<0.001). Noteworthily, nasal symptoms were significantly worsened in HDM-sensitized asthmatics with AR (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study highlighted that reduction in respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollution may play roles in asthma control and prevent exacerbations despite continuous indoor allergen exposure. Besides, worsening of nasal symptoms in HDM-sensitized asthmatics with AR implies importance of indoor avoidance measures for AR control.","Yucel, Esra; Suleyman, Ayse; Hizli Demirkale, Zeynep; Guler, Nermin; Ulker Tamay, Zeynep; Ozdemir, Cevdet",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,315,27

We used the Mendelian randomization principle to examine whether genetically low MBL is a risk factor for developing infections in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Serum MBL (n = 7305) and MBL genotype (n = 3043) were determined in a nationwide cohort of patients with new type 2 diabetes and up to 8 years follow-up for hospital-treated infections and community-based antimicrobial prescriptions. The associations were examined in spline and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS 1140 patients (16%) were hospitalized with an infection and 5077 patients (70%) redeemed an antimicrobial prescription. For low (≤100 μg/L) versus intermediate (101-1000 μg/L) serum MBL concentration, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 1.13(95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.33) for any hospital-treated infections and 1.19(1.01-1.41) for bacterial infections. Low MBL expression genotype was not associated with risk of any hospital-treated infections except for diarrheal diseases (aHR 2.23[1.04-4.80]). Low MBL expression genotype, but not low serum MBL, was associated with increased risk for antimicrobial prescriptions (aHR 1.18[1.04-2.34] and antibacterial prescriptions 1.20[1.05-1.36]).

ECMO patients that develop acute brain injuries (ABIs) are observed to have worse outcomes. We evaluated the association between rScO2 and ABI in venoarterial (VA) ECMO patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively-collected NIRS data from patients undergoing VA ECMO from April 2016 to October 2016. Baseline demographics, ECMO and clinical characteristics, cerebral oximetry data, neuroradiographic images, and functional outcomes were reviewed for each patient. rScO2 desaturations were defined as a >25% decline from baseline or an absolute value < 40% and quantified by frequency, duration, and area under the curve per hour of NIRS monitoring (AUC rate, rScO2*min/h). The primary outcome was ABI, defined as abnormalities noted on brain computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained during or after ECMO therapy. Results: Eighteen of Twenty patients who underwent NIRS monitoring while on VA ECMO were included in analysis. Eleven patients (61%) experienced rScO2 desaturations. Patients with desaturations were more frequently female (73 vs. 14%, p = 0.05), had acute liver dysfunction (64 vs. 14%, p = 0.05), and higher peak total bilirubin (5.2 mg/dL vs. 1.4 mg/dL, p = 0.02). Six (33%) patients exhibited ABI, and had lower pre-ECMO Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (5 vs. 10, p = 0.03) and higher peak total bilirubin levels (7.3 vs. 1.4, p = 0.009). All ABI patients experienced rScO2 desaturation while 42% of patients without ABI experienced desaturation (p = 0.04). ABI patients had higher AUC rates than non-ABI patients (right hemisphere: 5.7 vs. 0, p = 0.01, left hemisphere: 119 vs. 0, p = 0.06), more desaturation events (13 vs. 0, p = 0.05), longer desaturation duration (2:33 vs. 0, p = 0.002), and more severe desaturation events with rScO2 < 40 (9 vs. 0, p = 0.05). Patients with ABI had lower GCS scores (post-ECMO initiation) before care withdrawal or discharge than those without ABI (10 vs. 15, p = 0.02). Conclusions: The presence and burden of cerebral desaturations noted on NIRS cerebral oximetry are associated with secondary neurologic injury in adults undergoing VA ECMO.","Khan, Imad; Rehan, Mehboob; Parikh, Gunjan; Zammit, Christopher; Badjatia, Neeraj; Herr, Daniel; Kon, Zachary; Hogue, Charles; Mazzeffi, Michael",Frontiers in neurology,315,27

We used Escherichia coli expressed native capsid protein (pORF2) and its mutants with an attached Gly((5))-Ala (linker) reporter [enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/firefly luciferase (Fluc)]. Transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking showed near uniform particles of approximately 30-35 nm in diameter for pORF2 VLPs and 60-100 nm for reporter-linked VLPs. Binding of reporter-linked full-length (1-660aa) and N-terminal truncated (Δ1-112aa) pORF2 VLPs to Huh7 cell surfaces was found to be specific with 1.92 ± 0.065 × 10(5) sites per cell. Saturation binding indicated an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 121.1 ± 23.83 and 123.8 ± 16.15 nm for pORF2-linker-EGFP and pORF2-linker-Fluc VLPs respectively. A similar binding pattern was observed for Δ1-112aa pORF2-linker-EGFP and Δ1-112aa pORF2-linker-Fluc VLPs with K(d) values of 123.6 ± 10.60 and 135.6 ± 16.19 nm respectively. The affinity (log K(i)) of pORF2 binding on Huh7 cells in the presence of EGFP-tagged and Fluc-tagged pORF2 VLPs was found to be approximately 2.0. However, no VLP formation or binding was observed with refolded C-terminal truncated (Δ458-660aa) pORF2. We investigated HEV internalization using fluorescent VLPs (EGFP-VLPs), which showed vesicle-mediated uptake starting at 5 min post-incubation. The uptake of VLPs could be stopped by inhibitors for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, but not by caveosome inhibitors. No binding and uptake of EGFP-VLPs were observed on non-hepatic cell lines (HeLa and SiHa). These findings suggest that HEV attaches to the host cell via a specific high affinity receptor and enters the cytoplasm by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.","Kapur, N; Thakral, D; Durgapal, H; Panda, S K",Journal of viral hepatitis,315,24

Although it is generally believed that QTc changes almost exclusively result from concomitant treatment with QT-prolonging antimicrobials, direct effects of inflammatory cytokines on ventricular repolarization are increasingly recognized. We hypothesized that systemic inflammation per se can significantly prolong QTc during acute infections, via cytokine-mediated changes in K+-channels expression. Methods - We evaluated: (1) the frequency of QTc prolongation, and its association with inflammatory markers, in patients with different types of acute infections, during active disease and remission; (2) the prevalence of acute infections in a cohort of consecutive patients with Torsades de Pointes (TdP); (3) the relationship between K+-channels mRNA levels in ventricles and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and their changes in patients with acute infection over time. Results - In patients with acute infections, regardless of concomitant QT-prolonging antimicrobial treatments, QTc was significantly prolonged, but rapidly normalized in parallel to C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokine levels reduction. Consistently in the TdP cohort, concomitant acute infections were highly prevalent (30%), despite only a minority (25%) of these cases were treated with QT-prolonging antimicrobials. KCNJ2 K+-channel expression in PBMC, which strongly correlated to that in ventricles, inversely associated to CRP and interleukin-1 changes in acute infection patients. Conclusions - During acute infections, systemic inflammation rapidly induces cytokine-mediated ventricular electrical remodelling and significant QTc prolongation, regardless concomitant antimicrobial therapy. Although transient, these changes may significantly increase the risk of life-threatening VA in these patients. It is timely and warranted to transpose these findings to the current coronavirus disease-19 pandemic (COVID-19), in which both increased amounts of circulating cytokines and cardiac arrhythmias are demonstrated along with a frequent concomitant treatment with several QT-prolonging drugs.","Lazzerini, Pietro Enea; Acampa, Maurizio; Laghi-Pasini, Franco; Bertolozzi, Iacopo; Finizola, Francesco; Vanni, Francesca; Natale, Mariarita; Bisogno, Stefania; Cevenini, Gabriele; Cartocci, Alessandra; Giabbani, Beatrice; Migliacci, Nicola; D'Errico, Antonio; Dokollari, Alexander; Maccherini, Massimo; Boutjdir, Mohamed; Capecchi, Pier Leopoldo",Circulation.

METHODS Between 2010 and 2019, traditional RB shunt was performed in 24 patients, and modified RT shunt was performed in 23 children with extrahepatic portal hypertension (pHTN). A retrospective study was conducted based on comparative symptoms, platelet counts, color Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomographic portography of the portal system, and gastroscopic gastroesophageal varices postoperatively. The portal venous pressure was evaluated intraoperatively. RESULTS The operation in the RB group was notably more time-consuming than that in the RT group (P < 0.05). Compared to RT shunt, the reduction in gastroesophageal varix grading, the increases in platelets, and the caliber of the bypass were greater in the RB group (P < 0.05). Although not statistically significant, higher morbidity of surgical complications was found after RT shunt (17.4%) compared with RB shunt (8.3%) with patency rates of 82.6 and 91.7%, respectively. Additionally, patients exhibited a lower rate of rebleeding under the RB procedure (12.5%) than under the RT procedure (21.7%).

There are benefits to neoadjuvant therapy, such as monitoring for response, as well as an increased rate of breast conservation and reduction of potential morbidity associated with breast surgery, including axillary management. Among patients with highly proliferative tumors, such as HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, those with residual disease are at higher risk of recurrence, which informs the recommended systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting. For instance, in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, there is a role for adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine for those with residual disease at the time of surgery. The same holds true regarding the role of adjuvant capecitabine in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With the added complexities of treating patients in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak, additional considerations are critical, including initiation of surgery within an appropriate time from completion of neoadjuvant therapy. National consensus guidelines on time to surgery must be developed to improve measurement and comparison across systems.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analyses of patients who underwent CA within 180 days from the liver surgical resection to eradicate liver metastases present on the pre-surgical cross-sectional imaging or identified during intraoperative ultrasound that were not resected due to various reasons. Lesions treated with CA were evaluated for local tumor progression (LTP). Patients were evaluated for hepatic- and overall-recurrence-free survivals (hepatic-RFS and overall-RFS, respectively) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Sixteen patients (10 females; median age 55 years, range 28-69) underwent CA of 21 lesions (median size 8 mm, range 6 to 22). Indications for the use of CA were small future liver remnant in 10 (63%), inability to identify the lesion during surgical exploration in 3 (19%), and technical difficulty of resection in 3 (19%) patients. No liver-related complications were recorded following the surgical resection or the CA procedures. Primary and secondary CA efficacy rates were 95 and 100%, respectively. LTP was 0% at a median clinical follow-up of 27 months (range 4.0-108 months). Five-year hepatic-RFS, overall-RFS, and OS were 36, 16, and 51%, respectively. CONCLUSION The use of CA as a complement to surgical resection is safe and effective. Such approach could potentially expand the surgical candidacy for patients with limited liver functional reserve and reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality in this selected patient population with more advanced disease.","Odisio, Bruno C; Yamashita, Suguru; Frota, Livia; Huang, Steven Y; Kopetz, Scott E; Ahrar, Kamran; Chun, Yun Shin; Aloia, Thomas A; Hicks, Marshall E; Gupta, Sanjay; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,315,26

We aimed to describe the outcomes of critically ill ECMO patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery compared to non-ECMO patients. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective case-matched single-center study with propensity score analysis in a tertiary ICU. All patients who underwent abdominal surgery were included. RESULTS From 2006 to 2014, 77 patients admitted in our ICU underwent emergency abdominal surgery, 35 were on ECMO. Surgery indications were comparable for ECMO and non-ECMO patients: mostly intestinal ischemia (42%) and cholecystectomy (25%). Postoperative bleeding was significantly more frequent in ECMO group versus non-ECMO: 77% versus 40% transfused, with medians of 13 (6-22) versus 3 (0-5) packed red blood cell; 9 (3-17) versus 0 (0-4) fresh frozen plasma and 12 (3-22) versus 0 (0-8) platelet units (p < 0.001 for all items). Reintervention for hemorrhage was required in 20% versus 2%, respectively, p = 0.02. At multivariable analysis, ECMO was strongly associated with bleeding (OR, 5.6 [95% CI, 2.0-15.4]; p = 0.001). ICU mortality was higher for ECMO-treated patients (69% vs. 33%; p = 0.003), but perioperative mortality remained comparable between groups (11% vs. 12%, NS). Propensity score-matched analysis confirmed more frequent and severe bleeding in ECMO patients. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal surgery procedures on ECMO-treated patients are associated with a higher risk of hemorrhage compared to non-ECMO ICU patients. Further studies are needed to optimize ECMO patient management during such interventions.","Taieb, Anna; Jeune, Florence; Lebbah, Said; Schmidt, Matthieu; Deransy, Romain; Vaillant, Jean-Christophe; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Trésallet, Christophe; Combes, Alain; Bréchot, Nicolas",World journal of surgery,315,5

Objective To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia. Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days. Exposures Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures). Results The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female. Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties. No adverse events occurred. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated. By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.","Pollaers, Katherine; Herbert, Hayley; Vijayasekaran, Shyan",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,315,1

The outcomes of HALS using tissue fusion devices and conventional open surgery for curative resection of rectosigmoid carcinoma were compared. A total of 78 (45 males, 33 females; mean age, 57.2±11.7 y) rectosigmoid carcinoma patients underwent HALS surgery (HALS group) and 78 age-matched, sex-matched, and tumor status-matched rectosigmoid carcinoma patients (control group) underwent open resection between June 2008 and June 2010. In the HALS and control groups, abdominal incision length, intraoperative blood loss, procedure time, postoperative abdominal drainage, time to first flatus (bowel function return), length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, and pathology were assessed. Procedure times were similar in both groups (142.37±42.09 vs. 137.56±36.24 min). However, length of abdominal incision (5.14±0.47 vs. 13.17±2.41 cm), intraoperative blood loss (125.96±75.58 vs. 142.56±65.37 mL), need for postoperative analgesia, bowel function return (68.01±22.64 vs. 79.77±19.94 h), and postoperative hospital stay (6.47±1.73 vs. 7.73±1.71 d) were all significantly improved in the HALS group. At a median follow-up of 26 months, no significant differences in anastomotic recurrence were observed between groups (1 case/each group). Thus, the HALS approach for curative resection of rectosigmoid carcinoma was found to be similarly safe and effective compared with open resection. Furthermore, HALS may improve postoperative recovery and reduce hospitalization times.","Zhu, Yuping; Feng, Haiyang; Li, Qiken; Chen, Yinbo; Qian, Jun; Liu, Yong; Li, Dechuan","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",315,1

The utility of these clinical subtypes is unclear. However, the broader distinction between airway-predominant and emphysema-predominant COPD may be clinically relevant. The objective was to define clinical features of emphysema-predominant and non-emphysematous COPD patients. METHODS Current and former smokers from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) had chest computed tomography (CT) scans with quantitative image analysis. Emphysema-predominant COPD was defined by low attenuation area at -950 Hounsfield Units (LAA-950) ≥10%. Non-emphysematous COPD was defined by airflow obstruction with minimal to no emphysema (LAA-950 < 5%). RESULTS Out of 4197 COPD subjects, 1687 were classified as emphysema-predominant and 1817 as non-emphysematous; 693 had LAA-950 between 5-10% and were not categorized. Subjects with emphysema-predominant COPD were older (65.6 vs 60.6 years, p < 0.0001) with more severe COPD based on airflow obstruction (FEV1 44.5 vs 68.4%, p < 0.0001), greater exercise limitation (6-minute walk distance 1138 vs 1331 ft, p < 0.0001) and reduced quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score 43 vs 31, p < 0.0001). Self-reported diabetes was more frequent in non-emphysematous COPD (OR 2.13, p < 0.001), which was also confirmed using a strict definition of diabetes based on medication use. The association between diabetes and non-emphysematous COPD was replicated in the ECLIPSE study. CONCLUSIONS Non-emphysematous COPD, defined by airflow obstruction with a paucity of emphysema on chest CT scan, is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. COPD patients without emphysema may warrant closer monitoring for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia and vice versa.

METHODS A comprehensive review of the literature for studies on surgical treatment of previously coiled aneurysms was conducted. For each study, the following data were extracted: patient demographics, initial clinical status, location and size of aneurysms, time interval between initial/last endovascular procedure and surgery, surgical indications, and microsurgical technique. We performed subgroup analyses to compare direct clipping versus coil removal and clipping versus parent vessel occlusion, early (<4 weeks post-coiling) versus late surgery and anterior versus posterior circulation. RESULTS Twenty-six studies with 466 patients and 471 intracranial aneurysms were included. All of the studies were retrospective and non-comparative case-series. Patients undergoing direct clipping had lower perioperative morbidity (5.0 %, 95 % CI = 2.6-7.4 %) when compared to those undergoing coil removal and clipping (11.1 %, 95 % CI = 5.3-17.0 %) or parent vessel occlusion (13.1 %, 95 % CI = 4.6-21.6 %) (p = 0.05). Patients receiving early surgery (<4 weeks post-coiling) had significantly lower rates of good neurological outcome (77.1 %, 95 % CI = 69.3-84.8 %) when compared to those undergoing late surgery (92.1 %, 95 % CI = 89.0-95.2 %) (p < 0.01). There were higher rates of long-term neurological morbidity in the posterior circulation group (23.1 vs. 4.7 %, p < 0.01) as well as long-term neurological mortality (4.4 vs. 2.8 %, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis suggests that surgical treatment is safe and effective. Our data indicate that aneurysms that are amenable to direct clipping have superior outcomes. Late surgery was also associated with better clinical outcomes. Surgery of recurrent posterior circulation aneurysms was associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

We report rates of occlusion and treatment-related data in 44 patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms treated with flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with cavernous segment aneurysms treated with flow diversion were selected from a prospectively maintained data base of patients from 2009 to the present. Demographic information, treatment indications, number/type of flow diverters placed, outcome, complications (technical or clinical), and clinical/imaging follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS We identified 44 patients (37 females, 7 males) who had a flow diverter placed for treatment of a cavernous ICA aneurysm (mean age, 57.2; mean aneurysm size, 20.9 mm). The mean number of devices placed per patient was 2.2. At final angiographic follow-up (mean, 10.9 months), 71% had complete occlusion, and of those with incomplete occlusion, 40% had minimal remnants (<3 mm). In symptomatic patients, complete resolution or significant improvement in symptoms was noted in 90% at follow-up. Technical complications (which included, among others, vessel perforation in 4 patients, groin hematoma in 2, and asymptomatic carotid occlusion in 1) occurred in approximately 36% of patients but did not result in any clinical sequelae immediately or at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our series of flow-diversion treatments achieved markedly greater rates of complete occlusion than coiling, with a safety profile that compares favorably with that of carotid sacrifice.","Puffer, R C; Piano, M; Lanzino, G; Valvassori, L; Kallmes, D F; Quilici, L; Cloft, H J; Boccardi, E",AJNR.

As A. baumannii has multiple capsular serotypes, a universal antibody therapy would need to target conserved protein antigens rather than the capsular polysaccharides. We have immunized mice with single or multiple A. baumannii strains to induce antibody responses to protein antigens, and then assessed whether these responses provide cross-protection against a collection of genetically diverse clinical A. baumannii isolates. Immunized mice developed antibody responses to multiple protein antigens. Flow cytometry IgG binding assays and immunoblots demonstrated improved recognition of both homologous and heterologous clinical strains in sera from mice immunized with multiple strains compared to a single strain. The capsule partially inhibited bacterial recognition by IgG and the promotion of phagocytosis by human neutrophils. However, after immunization with multiple strains, serum antibodies to protein antigens promoted neutrophil phagocytosis of heterologous A. baumannii strains. In an infection model, mice immunized with multiple strains had lower bacterial counts in the spleen and liver following challenge with a heterologous strain. These data demonstrate that antibodies targeting protein antigens can improve immune recognition and protection against diverse A. baumannii strains, providing support for their use as an antibody therapy.","Kamuyu, Gathoni; Suen Cheng, Yat; Willcocks, Sam; Kewcharoenwong, Chidchamai; Kiratisin, Pattarachai; Taylor, Peter W; Wren, Brendan W; Lertmemongkolchai, Ganjana; Stabler, Richard A; Brown, Jeremy",Frontiers in immunology,315,6

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective observational study, hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified and divided into two groups based on the antiviral agents during their hospitalization. Patients in group LR were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg, twice a day, while patients in group LR+Ar were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice a day and arbidol 200 mg three times a day for at least 3 days. Data from these patients were collected from electronic medical record management system. RESULTS 73 patients were divided into two groups: group LR (34 cases) and group LR+Ar (39 cases), according to the antiviral agents. The overall cure rate of COVID-19 in group LR+Ar and group LR were 92.3% and 97.1%, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.62). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol led to a median time of hospital stay that was shorter by 1.5 days than in group LR (12.5 days vs. 14 days). The percentages of -COVID-19 RNA clearance was 92.3 in group LR and 97.1 in group LR+Ar which was similar to the cure rate. The median time to nucleic acid turning negative = (date of first negative PCR test) - (date of last positive PCR test) was 8.0 days in both groups with no significant difference (p = 0.59). Treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol did not significantly accelerate main symptom improvement and promote the image absorption of pulmonary inflammation. CONCLUSION No benefit was observed in the antiviral effect of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone in the hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of hydrogel wound dressings compared with alternative dressings or none on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 10 June 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to June Week 1 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, June 8, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 22) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 3 June 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrogel with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies (446 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of three studies comparing hydrogel dressings with basic wound contract dressings found significantly greater healing with hydrogel: risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.56. The three pooled studies had different follow-up times (12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks) and also evaluated ulcers of different severities (grade 3 and 4; grade 2 and grade unspecified). One study compared a hydrogel dressing with larval therapy and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed and another found no statistically significant difference in healing between hydrogel and platelet-derived growth factor. There was also no statistically significant difference in number of healed ulcers between two different brands of hydrogel dressing. All included studies were small and at unclear risk of bias and there was some clinical heterogeneity with studies including different ulcer grades. No included studies compared hydrogel with other advanced wound dressings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to suggest that hydrogel dressings are more effective in healing (lower grade) diabetic foot ulcers than basic wound contact dressings however this finding is uncertain due to risk of bias in the original studies. There is currently no research evidence to suggest that hydrogel is more effective than larval therapy or platelet-derived growth factors in healing diabetic foot ulcers, nor that one brand of hydrogel is more effective than another in ulcer healing. No RCTs comparing hydrogel dressings with other advanced dressing types were found.","Dumville, Jo C; O'Meara, Susan; Deshpande, Sohan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,315,24

The surgical technique-Percutaneous Internal Ring Suturing (PIRS) presented in this article is the world's first minimally invasive laparoscopic surgical technique for inguinal canal closure in dogs. AIM The aim of the presented study is to evaluate the possibility of employment of the laparoscopic PIRS technique in clinical practice as well as to technically evaluate its usefulness in the treatment of the inguinal hernia in dogs. The presented study describes the procedure and the results of laparoscopic treatment of 11 inguinal hernias in nine dogs (two bilateral). METHODS The whole procedure is performed under camera control introduced through one umbilical trocar. The very closure of the inner inguinal ring is done with the injection needle by a small puncture over the inguinal canal with the help of which the suture material is inserted, and the canal of the operated inguinal hernia is closed. Each operated dog underwent a thorough clinical examination before surgery which was combined with ultrasound examination of the inguinal canals before, immediately after and three months after surgery. RESULTS There was no hernia recurrence in the study period in the operated dogs and all individuals returned to full mobility immediately after recovery from anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Due to the low invasiveness and simplicity of performance, the PIRS technique described in the study should be taken into account when choosing a treatment method for non-traumatic inguinal hernia in dogs. At the same time, the possibility of using the described technique in other types of inguinal hernia in dogs requires further research.","Prządka, Przemysław; Liszka, Bartłomiej; Skrzypczak, Piotr; Kubiak-Nowak, Dominika; Borawski, Wojciech; Juźwiak, Łukasz; Kiełbowicz, Zdzisław; Patkowski, Dariusz",PloS one,315,16

However, severe pathology during some infections, including SARS-CoV-2, is driven by hyperactive cytokine release, or a cytokine storm. The innate sensors that activate production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during COVID-19 remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we show that both TLR2 and MYD88 expression were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Mechanistically, TLR2 and Myd88 were required for β-coronavirus-induced inflammatory responses, and TLR2-dependent signaling induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines during coronavirus infection independent of viral entry. TLR2 sensed the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein as its ligand. In addition, blocking TLR2 signaling in vivo provided protection against the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our study provides a critical understanding of the molecular mechanism of β-coronavirus sensing and inflammatory cytokine production, which opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies to counteract the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Min; Karki, Rajendra; Williams, Evan Peter; Yang, Dong; Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth; Vogel, Peter; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Nature immunology,315,1

Polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400) is an important constituent of eye drops and artificial tears. The present study was targeted to study the binding of α-crystallin and PEG-400 employing multi spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with molecular modeling and docking approach. There was an apparent hypochromism in α-crystallin in the presence of varying PEG-400 concentrations; the binding constant obtained was 0.9 X 105 M-1 implying that strong binding is taking place between α-crystallin and PEG-400. Fluorescence spectroscopy suggested good binding of PEG-400 to α-crystallin with a binding constant (K) of 106 M-1. Moreover, fluorescence quenching studies carried out at three different temperatures suggested α-crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation to be guided by combination of static and dynamic modes. Thermodynamic parameters suggested α-crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation is driven by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, making it seemingly specific. Far UV-CD spectra revealed no shift in the peak implying no alterations in the secondary structure of α-crystallin upon PEG-400 binding further validating complex formation. In vitro assays were further entrenched by in silico assays. Molecular modeling was used to make the functionally active form of α-crystallin. A binding pocket located in the β chain was delineated by Prank Web; molecular docking showed binding of PEG-400 in this pocket. This study will give an insight into the binding of PEG-400 with α-crystallin and can serve as a rationale for the discovery of therapeutic molecules that can be used for the treatment of eye-related crystallin-directed diseases. Highlights PEG-400 is a constituent of lubricant eye drops. Molecular modelling gave functionally active crystallin. Molecular docking showed PEG-400 in the binding pocket.

This study aims to explore whether the centrifugation of synovial fluid could influence the positive result of LE strip caused by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). METHODS From March 2016 to December 2018, 64 patients who were diagnosed as PJI or aseptic arthritis and another 20 patients with inflammatory arthritis were enrolled in our study. After synovial fluid samples were obtained, the LE strip test was performed with and without centrifugation. Then clinicians read the color changes 3 min after the samples were dropped and classify the results based on the instruction of strip. The differences between septic and aseptic arthritis patients and septic and inflammatory arthritis patients were analyzed. RESULTS Among the included 21 PJI samples, 19 of them showed positive results (++) of LE strip before centrifugation. After centrifugation, two samples changed from two-positive (++) to one-positive (+), which is also considered as positive. Before centrifugation, 29 of the LE strip tests in the aseptic arthritis group (43 samples included) were ++ or +. After centrifugation, 16 of the samples yielded negative results. Among 20 samples with inflammatory arthritis, LE strip of 18 samples were positive (++ or +) before centrifugation, among which only 3 samples remained as positive after centrifugation. CONCLUSION LE strip test results could be influenced by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of PJI. Centrifugation should be performed for LE strip tests to determine whether the result is a true positive or a false positive influenced by inflammatory arthritis.","Zhang, Jinling; Gui, Binjie; Cheng, Fangyue; Rong, Genxiang; Tang, Zhi; Shen, Cailiang",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,315,16

These viruses are particularly dangerous in regions associated with poor development indicators and high vulnerability. The drivers of these disease crises include failures in the way that animal diseases are detected and reported and failures in the way in which disease response is implemented by animal health and public health systems. In addition, the lack of a coordinated response hampers disease control efforts. A comprehensive approach for disease prevention, detection and response, however, requires a coordinated and joint effort among governments, communities, donors and international networks to invest effectively in prevention systems that can identify early signals of the emergence, spillover and spread of animal pathogens at the local level. These signals include trade bans, market closures, civil unrest, heavy rains and droughts associated with climate change, and livestock intensification or changes in consumer behaviour. The global community needs to increase its investment in early warning and detection systems that can provide information that enables action to be taken at the national, regional and global levels in the event of an outbreak of a transboundary animal disease (TAD). Like any preventive measure, an early warning system requires financial resources, but these are insignificant when compared to the losses that are avoided. Building a global early warning and effective response system for outbreaks is value for money, as the benefits far outweigh the costs. The goal of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is to end hunger and poverty, which is a challenging and complex task. Building global capacity to prepare for and respond to TADs is an important element of the FAO's strategic objective to increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises. Each year, livestock, and the people who rely upon them for their livelihoods, are confronted with animal disease and crises. They can strike suddenly, causing obvious illness and death, or emerge insidiously and become well established before becoming apparent. Animal disease emergencies threaten the production of, and access to, food; consequently, one of the FAO's missions is to help countries to prepare for and respond to animal health disasters.","Tekola, B; Myers, L; Lubroth, J; Plee, L; Calistri, P; Pinto, J",Revue scientifique et technique,315,24

This article reports a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies exploring the research question: What do health practitioners perceive enhances their readiness to address domestic violence and abuse? Multiple data bases were searched in June 2018. Inclusion criteria included: qualitative design; population of health practitioners in clinical settings; and a focus on intimate partner violence. Two reviewers independently screened articles and findings from included papers were synthesised according to the method of thematic synthesis. Forty-seven articles were included in the final sample, spanning 41 individual studies, four systematic reviews and two theses between the years of 1992 and 2018; mostly from high income countries. Five themes were identified as enhancing readiness of health practitioners to address DVA: Having a commitment; Adopting an advocacy approach; Trusting the relationship; Collaborating with a team; and Being supported by the health system. We then propose a health practitioners' readiness framework called the CATCH Model (Commitment, Advocacy, Trust, Collaboration, Health system support). Applying this model to health practitioners' different readiness for change (using Stage of Change framework) allows us to tailor facilitating strategies in the health setting to enable greater readiness to deal with intimate partner abuse.","Hegarty, Kelsey; McKibbin, Gemma; Hameed, Mohajer; Koziol-McLain, Jane; Feder, Gene; Tarzia, Laura; Hooker, Leesa",PloS one,315,31

Since mutation of ion-channel proteins CACNA1A and GABRD have been associated with epilepsy, it is important to determine the post-traumatic epilepsy-associated changes in expression levels of these ion channel proteins. Additionally, curcumin is already known for its antiepileptic and neuroprotective potential in FeCl3-induced model of post-traumatic epilepsy. Thus, we investigated FeCl3-induced epilepsy mediated differential expression of CACNA1A and GABRD in the cortical region of the rat brain. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the expression of both proteins. For this, epilepsy was induced by intracortical FeCl3 injection (5 μl of 100 mM). Additionally, curcumin (conc. 1000 ppm; 75 mg/kg of b.wt.; for 14 and 28 days) was administered, mixed with normal food pellets. Results obtained from EEG-MUA and Morris water maze assay demonstrate the progression of epilepsy after FeCl3 injection. Additionally, western blotting and histological studies show the downregulation of CACNA1A and GABRD during epileptogenesis. It was observed that epilepsy-associated decline in learning and memory of animals might be linked with the dysregulation of both proteins. Results also demonstrated that curcumin administration ameliorated epilepsy-associated change in expression of both CACNA1A and GABRD proteins. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effect of curcumin against iron-induced epilepsy might be accompanied by the alleviated upregulation of these channel proteins.","Kumar, Prince; Sharma, Deepak",Molecular biology reports,315,1

STUDY DESIGN Preterm infants <32 weeks were randomly assigned to the use of a disposable PediCap EtCO2 detector (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) (qualitative) or a Microstream side stream capnography device (Covidien) (quantitative) for FMV in the delivery room, via a NeoPuff T-piece resuscitator (Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand). The primary outcome was the presence of normocarbia, based on partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) readings obtained in the neonatal intensive care unit within an hour of birth. Normocarbia was defined as a PaCO2 measure between 37.5 and 60 mm Hg (5-8 kPa). RESULTS Of the 59 infants included, 59% (35/59) were within the PaCO2 target range within an hour of birth. There was no difference in the primary outcome; 64% (21/33) of infants in the quantitative group were within the PaCO2 range compared with 54% (14/26) in the qualitative group (P = .594); and 93% of participants <28 weeks' gestation were within the PaCO2 normocarbic range (90% [9/10] in quantitative group and 100% [5/5] in the qualitative group [P = 1]). There was no difference in the intubation rate, days of ventilation, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative or qualitative EtCO2 detection methods are both feasible for FMV in the delivery room. Although there was no difference in the incidence of normocarbia, the use of either form of EtCO2 monitoring should be considered during newborn stabilization, especially in infants less than 28 weeks' gestation.

METHODS AND RESULTS Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to transendocardial injection of MSCs combined with CPCs, MSCs alone, CPCs alone, or placebo, and followed for 12 months. Seven centers enrolled 125 participants with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 28.6 ± 6.1% and scar size 19.4 ± 5.8%, in NYHA class II or III. The proportion of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was significantly decreased by CPCs alone (-22% vs. placebo, P = 0.043). Quality of life (MLHFQ score) was significantly improved by MSCs alone (P = 0.050) and MSCs+CPCs (P = 0.023) vs. placebo. LVEF, LV volumes, scar size, 6-min walking distance, and peak VO2 did not differ significantly among groups. CONCLUSIONS This is the first multicenter trial assessing CPCs and a combination of two cell types from different tissues in HF patients. The results show that treatment is safe and feasible. Even with maximal guideline-directed therapy, both CPCs and MSCs were associated with improved clinical outcomes (MACE and quality of life, respectively) in ischemic HF without affecting LV function or structure, suggesting possible systemic or paracrine cellular mechanisms. Combining MSCs with CPCs was associated with improvement in both these outcomes. These results suggest potential important beneficial effects of CPCs and MSCs and support further investigation in HF patients.","Bolli, Roberto; Mitrani, Raul D; Hare, Joshua M; Pepine, Carl J; Perin, Emerson C; Willerson, James T; Traverse, Jay H; Henry, Timothy D; Yang, Phillip C; Murphy, Michael P; March, Keith L; Schulman, Ivonne H; Ikram, Sohail; Lee, David P; O'Brien, Connor; Lima, Joao A; Ostovaneh, Mohammad R; Ambale-Venkatesh, Bharath; Lewis, Gregory; Khan, Aisha; Bacallao, Ketty; Valasaki, Krystalenia; Longsomboon, Bangon; Gee, Adrian P; Richman, Sara; Taylor, Doris A; Lai, Dejian; Sayre, Shelly L; Bettencourt, Judy; Vojvodic, Rachel W; Cohen, Michelle L; Simpson, Lara; Aguilar, David; Loghin, Catalin; Moyé, Lem; Ebert, Ray F; Davis, Barry R; Simari, Robert D",European journal of heart failure,315,30

We hypothesized that the association and intense utilization of the ER during viral replication would induce the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction cascade that acts to modulate translation, membrane biosynthesis, and the levels of ER chaperones. Here, we report that infection by the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) triggers the proximal UPR transducers, as revealed by monitoring the IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP-1 mRNA and the cleavage of ATF6alpha. However, we detected minimal downstream induction of UPR target genes, including ERdj4, ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein, and p58(IPK), or expression of UPR reporter constructs. Translation initiation factor eIF2alpha is highly phosphorylated during MHV infection, and translation of cellular mRNAs is attenuated. Furthermore, we found that the critical homeostasis regulator GADD34, which recruits protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2alpha during the recovery phase of the UPR, is not expressed during MHV infection. These results suggest that MHV modifies the UPR by impeding the induction of UPR-responsive genes, thereby favoring a sustained shutdown of the synthesis of host cell proteins while the translation of viral proteins escalates. The role of this modified response and its potential relevance to viral mechanisms for the evasion of innate defense signaling pathways during coronavirus replication are discussed.","Bechill, John; Chen, Zhongbin; Brewer, Joseph W; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,315,1

It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement is may threaten vaccinated people's lives and long-term side effect must be considered.

Infrapopliteal (IP) occlusions are common in CLI, and successful limb salvage may require restoration of arterial flow in the distribution of a chronically occluded vessel. We sought to describe the procedural characteristics and outcomes of patients with IP occlusions who underwent endovascular intervention for treatment of CLI. METHODS All patients with IP interventions for treatment of CLI from 2006 to 2012 were included. Angiographic and procedural data were compared between patients who underwent intervention for IP occlusions vs IP stenosis. Restenosis was determined by Doppler ultrasound imaging. Limb salvage was the primary end point of the study. Additional end points included primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, occlusion crossing success, procedural success, and amputation-free survival. RESULTS A total of 187 patients with CLI underwent interventions for 356 IP lesions, and 77 patients (41%) had interventions for an IP occlusion. Patients with an intervention for IP occlusion were more likely to have zero to one vessel runoff (83% vs 56%; P < .001) compared with interventions for stenosis. Compared with IP stenoses, IP occlusions were longer (118 ± 86 vs 73 ± 67 mm; P < .001) and had a smaller vessel diameter (2.5 ± 0.8 vs 2.7 ± 0.5 mm; P = .02). Wire crossing was achieved in 83% of IP occlusions, and the overall procedural success for IP occlusions was 79%. The overall 1-year limb salvage rate was 84%. Limb salvage was highest in the stenosis group, slightly lower in the successful occlusion group, and lowest in the failed occlusion group (92% vs 75% vs 58%, respectively; P = .02). Unsuccessfully treated IP occlusions were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of major amputation (hazard ratio, 5.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-17.7) and major amputation or death (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-6.63). CONCLUSIONS Successful endovascular recanalization of IP occlusions can be achieved with guidewire and support catheter techniques in most patients. In patients selected for an endovascular-first approach for IP occlusions in CLI, this strategy can be successfully implemented with favorable rates of limb salvage.","Singh, Gagan D; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Yeo, Khung-Keong; Singh, Satinder; Westin, Gregory G; Pevec, William C; Dawson, David L; Laird, John R",Journal of vascular surgery,315,1

Suggestions have been made to extend their useful life by using a surgical mask as an outer barrier, but the physiological impact of this added barrier upon the wearer has not been studied. METHODS A surgical mask was worn over an N95 filtering facepiece respirator by 10 healthcare workers for 1 h at each of two work rates. Heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels and respirator dead space gases were monitored and compared with controls (N95 filtering facepiece respirator without a surgical mask). Subjective perceptions of exertion and comfort were assessed by numerical rating scales. RESULTS There were no significant differences in physiological variables between those who used surgical masks and controls. Surgical masks decreased dead space oxygen concentrations of the filtering facepiece respirators at the lesser work rate (P = 0.03) and for filtering facepiece respirators with an exhalation valve at the higher work rate (P = 0.003). Respirator dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were not harmonious with Occupational Safety and Health Administration workplace ambient atmosphere standards. Exertion and comfort scores were not significantly impacted by the surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS Use of a surgical mask as an outer barrier over N95 filtering facepiece respirators does not significantly impact the physiological burden or perceptions of comfort and exertion by the wearer over that experienced without use of a surgical mask.","Roberge, Raymond J; Coca, Aitor; Williams, W Jon; Palmiero, Andrew J; Powell, Jeffrey B",Respirology,315,1

This course covered physiology, research, clinical practice, and career guidance regarding the fields of wilderness, space, hyperbaric, combat, and exercise medicine. The primary aim was to generate interest in and awareness of these seldom covered fields of medicine by exposing medical students to these disciplines during their preclinical years. A postcourse questionnaire was implemented to investigate whether the MEE course increased awareness of, interest in, and knowledge in the fields of medicine included in the curriculum. Through 2 iterations of the class, a total of 67 students enrolled in the course, and 38 students completed the questionnaire. After course completion, 95% felt they better understood the work and lifestyle of the fields covered, 100% learned more about concepts of each field, and 74% agreed that the elective influenced the direction of their future careers to include some part of the fields emphasized. Although only a limited number of students enrolled in this course, these initial findings suggest that the MEE curriculum may have some utility in promoting awareness of and interest in these medical disciplines among students who attend the course. With continued student and faculty support, this course will likely be continued annually at our institution. We believe that certain aspects of this course may be useful in helping develop similar courses at other medical schools.","Babu, Gautam; Upchurch, Bradley D; Young, William H; Levine, Benjamin D",Wilderness & environmental medicine,315,16

Public health guidance recommends the use of varenicline, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as smoking cessation aids in the UK. Additionally, the first electronic cigarette has been licensed for use as a smoking cessation medicine. However, there are ongoing concerns about the safety of these medicines. We present a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine how these smoking cessation medicines compare to each other with respect to their neuropsychiatric safety in adult smokers. Secondary aims include updating the evidence regarding the effectiveness and cardiovascular safety of these medicines for use in a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include randomised controlled trials and observational studies with control groups comparing monotherapy with varenicline, bupropion, NRT or electronic cigarette and combination therapies to each other, placebo or usual care. The primary composite safety outcome will be serious adverse events, defined as events that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalisation or resulted in significant disability or congenital/birth defect. The preferred effectiveness outcome will be sustained smoking cessation defined as abstinence for a minimum of 6 months as determined by biochemical validation. We will include trials identified by previous reviews and search relevant databases for newly published trials as well as contacting study authors to identify unpublished information. We will conduct fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analyses for each pairwise comparison of treatments and outcome; where these estimates differ, we will consider reasons for heterogeneity, quantified using the between-study variance (τ2). For each outcome, we will construct a NMA in a Bayesian framework which will be compared with the pair-wise results, allowing us to rank treatments. The effectiveness estimates from the NMA will be entered into a probabilistic economic model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this evidence synthesis study as it involves analysis of secondary data from randomised controlled trials and observational studies. The review will make an important contribution to the knowledge base around the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation medicines. Results will be disseminated to the general public, healthcare practitioners and clinicians, academics, industry and policy makers.

However, the relevance of these models to predict in vivo human deposition has not been validated. This study compared in vivo nasal aerosol deposition and in vitro deposition in a human plastinated head model (NC1) and its replica constructed from CT-scan (NC2). METHODS Two nebulizers (Atomisor Sonique® and Easynose®) were used to administer a 5.6 μm aerosol of (99m)Tc-DTPA to seven healthy volunteers and to the nasal models. Aerosol deposition was quantified by γ-scintigraphy in the nasal, upper nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (MS) regions. The distribution of aerosol deposition was determined along three nasal cavity axes (x, y and z). RESULTS There was no significant difference regarding aerosol deposition between the volunteers and NC1. Aerosol deposition was significantly lower in NC2 than in volunteers regarding nasal region (p < 0.05) but was similar for the upper nasal cavity and MS regions. Mean aerosol distribution for NC1 came within the standard deviation (SD) of in vivo distribution, whereas that of NC2 was outside the in vivo SD for x and y axes. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, nasal models can be used to predict aerosol deposition produced by nebulizers, but their performance depends on their design.","Le Guellec, Sandrine; Le Pennec, Deborah; Gatier, Stephane; Leclerc, Lara; Cabrera, Maria; Pourchez, Jeremie; Diot, Patrice; Reychler, Gregory; Pitance, Laurent; Durand, Marc; Jamar, François; Vecellio, Laurent",Pharmaceutical research,315,24

Prone positioning has been used successfully in adult patients with ARDS and has been shown to decrease mortality. The efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS is less clear. In this review, we discuss the physiologic principles and literature on prone positioning in adults and children relative to COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS There are limited published data on prone positioning in respiratory failure because of COVID-19. The use of proning in nonintubated patients with COVID-19 may improve oxygenation and dyspnea but has not been associated with improved outcomes. Initial adult cohort studies of intubated patients undergoing prone positioning in severe ARDS related to COVID-19 have shown an improvement in mortality. Although the use of proning in children with severe COVID-19 is recommended, data supporting its use is scarce. SUMMARY Additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS are needed to provide evidence for or against this treatment strategy in children. Given the unknown evolution of this pandemic, collaborative research efforts across pediatric centers provides the greatest opportunity to develop a data driven-approach to make use of this potential therapy.","Leroue, Matthew K; Maddux, Aline B; Mourani, Peter M",Current opinion in pediatrics,315,20

We aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of whether the timing of vertebroplasty (VP) for vertebral fracture associated with the risk of hip fracture for hip replacement.We identified 142,782 patients from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database with thoracolumbar vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification:805.2-805.9) who were followed up from 2000 to 2013. These patients were divided into those who underwent VP (VP group) (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification : 78.49) within 3 months and those who did not (non-VP group). After adjusting for the confounding factors, the Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the effect of early VP on reducing the risk of hip fracture. The difference in the risk of hip replacement, between the VP group and non-VP group was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test.In the 14-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence rate of hip replacement in the VP group was lower than that in the non-VP group (0.362% and 0.533%, respectively, long-rank P < .001). There was a significant difference between the 2 groups since the first-year follow-up.Our study showed that early VP performed to avoid progression of the kyphotic changes following thoracolumbar vertebral fracture may reduce the risk of hip fracture.

Consequently, this postponement and other factors might have a negative impact on patients planning to undergo aesthetic procedures. Understanding the changes in patient motivation and perception in comparison to the prepandemic period is imperative for proper adjustment of plastic surgery clinics.A prospective questionnaire study was conducted on patients with cancelled aesthetic surgeries or procedures to determine the effects that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had on patient motivation regarding cosmetic surgery and procedures and to establish a relationship between patient characteristics and the overall effect of pandemia on the perception of cosmetic surgery.Although most patients felt angry or frustrated due to the cancellation of their surgeries or procedures, the majority accepted that it was a necessary precaution. Patients with a history of previous minimally invasive procedures had a significantly higher ratio of acceptance for cancellations, whereas single patients were more likely to want to have their treatments done if the decision were left up to them. A subset of patients considered undergoing additional cosmetic procedures in the setting of self-isolation, and all patients stated that they would reschedule once the pandemia was under control.Patients with established motivation for plastic surgery and minimally invasive procedures ultimately plan to resume their normal treatments alongside others after the pandemia subsides. Plastic surgeons must actively communicate with their patient population during this time to properly educate, embrace, and direct them under scientific guidelines.","Sezgin, Billur; Tatar, Sedat; Kara, Basak Selin; Ozmen, Selahattin; Yavuzer, Reha",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,315,1

Legal scholars have hypothesized that the effects of the pandemic may contribute to more coercive plea bargains (Cannon, 2020; Johnson, 2020). In this study, we explored defense attorneys' perceptions of whether and how the plea process has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPOTHESES This study was exploratory, and we made no a priori hypotheses. METHOD We surveyed 93 practicing United States defense attorneys about their perceptions of whether and how the pandemic has affected court procedures, plea-bargaining and prosecutorial behavior, and defendant decision-making. We conducted semistructured follow-up interviews with 13 defense attorneys to help contextualize the survey responses. RESULTS The majority of defense attorneys (81%, n = 76) reported that the plea process had changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that they experienced difficulty contacting and communicating with their clients, especially those who were detained. Two thirds of defense attorneys (n = 42) who said the plea process had changed thought that prosecutors were offering more lenient deals. One third of defense attorneys with detained clients (n = 23) reported having had clients plead guilty due to COVID-19 related conditions who might not have under normal circumstances. CONCLUSIONS The majority of defense attorneys reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their ability to access and advise clients, and they believed that leverage in plea negotiations had shifted further to individual prosecutors. At the same time, the attorneys reported that prosecutors were offering more lenient deals, painting a complex picture of the plea negotiation process during the pandemic.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) protein expression was studied throughout repair by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Paradoxically, HIF1α was strongly expressed in intact skin and its expression decreased dramatically following wounding (p<0.01), despite the expected hypoxic state within the wounded tissue. HIF1α levels reincreased in parallel with the epithelialization process, and more rapidly in body wounds than in limb wounds (p<0.01). HIF1α localized predominantly to the keratinocyte layer, in which it was constitutively expressed throughout healing. The HIF1α target gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) showed a pattern of expression similar to HIF1α throughout the healing process and also localized to the keratinocyte layer, suggesting that HIF1α may regulate its constitutive expression. The HIF1α target genes vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 1 (SLC2A1) however did not have a pattern of expression similar to HIF1α, at the mRNA level. We conclude that HIF1α is expressed in a continuous and hypoxia-independent manner in equine keratinocytes in both intact and wounded skin, and may regulate the expression of CDKN1A in this cell type.","Deschene, Karine; Céleste, Christophe; Boerboom, Derek; Theoret, Christine L",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,315,1

We aim to examine the association between tracheostomy timing, placement technique, and patient demographics on survival. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS A retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent tracheostomy in 2016 and 2017 at one urban academic tertiary-care hospital. Kaplan-Meier curves were created based on combinations of tracheostomy timing and technique (early percutaneous, early non-percutaneous, late percutaneous, and late non-percutaneous). Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine multivariable effects of timing, technique, and other demographic factors. Primary outcome measures were tracheostomy-related mortality and overall survival. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Our study included 523 patients. There were six tracheostomy-related deaths, with hemorrhage and tracheoesophageal fistula being the most common causes. Tracheostomy timing and technique combinations were not associated with differences in all-cause mortality or survival following discharge. Cox proportional hazard models showed that Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and unknown partner status were associated with a decrease in survival (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively). Additionally, patient age, gender, race, CCI, and body mass index were not independently associated with changes in survival. CONCLUSION Late and non-percutaneous tracheostomies were associated with more tracheostomy-related deaths, but timing and technique were not associated with differences in patient survival. Multiple regression analysis showed that increased patient comorbidities, measured via CCI, and unknown partner status were independently associated with decreased survival. Proceduralists should discuss timing, technique, and patient social factors together with the medical care team when constructing plans for postdischarge management.

There were 77 males. The mean age was 65 years. Three patients (2.9%) required conversion to a laparotomy. The median ICU and hospital stays were 2 and 8 days, respectively. Major complications occurred in 12.5% of patients and minor complications in 15.4% of patients. The incidence of leak was 9.6% and of anastomotic stricture was 26%. The 30-day mortality was 1.9% with an in-hospital mortality of 2.9%. The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved was 13.8. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy is feasible with a low conversion rate, acceptable morbidity, and low mortality. Our preferred operative approach is the laparoscopic\thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis resection, which provides a tension-free intrathoracic anastomosis.","Nguyen, Ninh T; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Smith, Brian R; Chang, Kenneth J; Gray, James; Hoyt, David",Annals of surgery,315,31

We sought to evaluate the feasibility of performing this procedure using endoscopic transoral (EndoT) surgical techniques without robotics. METHODS Preclinical cadaveric study using two human cadavers. Hybrid SCPL-CHEP was performed with a flexible endoscope for visualization and hand-held instruments for manipulation (SILS Hook monopolar and Dissect, HAVAS LaryngoFIT malleable straight jaw instruments, and Stratafix 4-0 spiral knotless barbed suture). RESULTS EndoT hybrid SCPL-CHEP was successfully performed. The hand-manipulated rigid instruments allowed for transoral incisions and mucosal suturing. We provide the procedural steps of EndoT hybrid techniques. CONCLUSIONS EndoT hybrid SCPL-CHEP was technically feasible in the preclinical cadaveric laboratory setting and appeared comparable to the hybrid SCPL-CHEP via transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Selected handheld instruments and flexible endoscopy appear to facilitate minimally invasive surgery of the larynx. This novel procedure and technique warrant further clinical study for consideration of feasibility, applicability, and patient benefit.","Nakayama, Meijin; Orosco, Ryan K; Holsinger, F Christopher; Spriano, Giuseppe; Succo, Giovanni; De Virgilio, Armando; Oridate, Nobuhiko","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",315,31

There are few reports of endovascular management of spinal aneurysms associated with SAVM. OBJECTIVE To present endovascular management of aneurysms associated with SAVM. METHODS Of 91 patients with SAVMs,eight (9%) presented with aneurysms. Of these, three were male and five were female with a median age of 18 years (range 11-38). We evaluated the presenting pattern, lesion level, type of the target aneurysm related to the presenting pattern and AVM nidus, and the result obtained after embolization or open surgery. Clinical status was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue (ALS) gait and micturition scale scores. RESULTS The presenting patterns were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, n=3) or mass effect caused by extrinsic (n=4) or intrinsic (n=1) cord compression. Aneurysms were located in four cervical, two thoracic, and two lumbar enlargement areas. There were two prenidal (arterial), three nidal, and three postnidal (venous) aneurysms. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 9 mm (range 3-27). Glue embolization (n=6), open surgery (n=1), and combined surgery and embolization (n=1) was performed to obliterate the aneurysms. Obliteration of the target aneurysms resulted in improvement of symptoms and clinical stabilization of SAVMs in all patients during a mean of 55 months (range 7-228) of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Identification of a symptomatic aneurysm should be associated with clinical presentation pattern. Targeted obliteration of the aneurysm by embolization and/or surgery resulted in improvement of symptoms and stabilization of SAVM.","Jung, Sung Chul; Song, Yunsun; Cho, Su Hee; Kim, Joonggoo; Noh, Seung Yeon; Lee, Sang Hun; Sheen, Jae Jon; Rhim, Seung Chul; Jeon, Sang Ryong; Suh, Dae Chul",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,315,1

In this study, we aimed to determine whether ultrasonography (US) was more precise in localizing the superficial radial nerve (SRN), dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve (DUCN), ulnar nerve (UN) crossing the cubital tunnel, and radial nerve (RN) crossing the spiral groove compared to conventional techniques. METHODS Thirty healthy young subjects (15 male) were recruited. Each subject underwent both landmark-based and US-guided NCS. Onset latencies and amplitudes of compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), and stimulation levels (i.e. intensity × duration) required to obtain maximal CMAP amplitudes were compared between the two techniques. RESULTS The mean CMAP amplitudes of the UN above the cubital tunnel (9.55 ± 1.96 vs 8.96 ± 1.94 mV, p = 0.030), UN below the cubital tunnel (10.11 ± 2.07 vs 9.37 ± 1.95 mV, p < 0.001), and RN below the spiral groove (5.21 ± 1.56 vs 4.34 ± 1.03 mV, p < 0.001) were significantly greater using US-guided NCSs compared to landmark-based NCSs. The mean onset latency of the DUCN was significantly shorter using US-guided NCSs (1.49 ± 0.15 vs 1.57 ± 0.14 ms, p = 0.020). The required stimulation level in the UN and RN was significantly lower using US-guided NCSs. DISCUSSION When performing NCSs, US guidance provides a more precise localization of the stimulator and electrodes for the DNCN, UN and RN, while providing comparable localization for the SRN, compared to landmark-based techniques.","Wei, Kuo-Chang; Chiu, Yi-Hsiang; Wu, Chueh-Hung; Liang, Huey-Wen; Wang, Tyng-Guey",Muscle & nerve,315,1

Genetic variations have also been associated with erythrocyte parameters. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and erythrocyte parameters in humans. A systematic review protocol was published at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42016053052). Literature searches were conducted in Medline and Embase. Studies were included if: investigating a(n) causality/association/correlation; population-based; investigating a human population of Caucasian/mixed-ethnic descent; and written in English, Dutch or German. Study quality was assessed using the quality of genetic association studies tool. In total, 4385 studies were screened on title/abstract and 194 studies were screened on full text. Inclusion criteria were met by 13 candidate gene studies (n = 126-49,488) and eight genome-wide association studies (GWASes, n = 1664-116,666). One moderate and six good quality GWAS(es) identified 1237 SNPs located in/near 241 genes. SNPs in/near ten genes were found to be associated with one or more erythrocyte parameter(s) by multiple GWASes, namely HIST1H2AC, MPST, SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 with mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), HIST1H1T and KCTD17 with MCH and mean cell volume (MCV), HBS1L and MYB with MCH, MCV and red cell count (RCC), HFE with MCH, MCV and hemoglobin, and TMPRSS6 with MCH, MCV, hemoglobin and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Four genes were found across multiple erythrocyte parameters by one study in each parameter. Fourteen SNPs were associated with one or more erythrocyte parameter(s) in multiple cohorts, namely rs129128, rs17342717, rs228129 and rs5756504 (MCH), rs4895441, rs7775698, rs9376092 and rs9494145 (MCH, MCV, RCC), rs6569992 (MCH, RCC), rs1800562 (hemoglobin, MCH, MCV), rs130624 and rs198846 (MCH, MCV), rs4820268 and rs855791 (MCH, MCV, MCHC).

Despite these successes, the scientific and bio-industrial communities have recently recognised that innate and pre-existing immunity against Ad vectors can constitute a serious obstacle to the development and application of this technology. It is essential to overcome vector-mediated immune responses, such as production of inflammatory cytokines and pre-existing immunity to Ad, because the induction of these responses not only shortens the period of gene expression but also leads to serious side effects.

This review aims to describe available techniques to monitor drive and effort. RECENT FINDINGS Measuring drive and effort is necessary to quantify risk and implement strategies to minimize lung and the diaphragm injury by modifying sedation and ventilation. Evidence on the efficacy of such strategies is yet to be elucidated, but physiological and epidemiological data support the need to avoid injurious patterns of breathing effort.Some techniques have been used in research for decades (e.g., esophageal pressure or airway occlusion pressure), evidence on their practical utility is growing, and technical advances have eased implementation. More novel techniques (e.g., electrical activity of the diaphragm and ultrasound) are being investigated providing new insights on their use and interpretation. SUMMARY Available techniques provide reliable measures of the intensity and timing of drive and effort. Simple, noninvasive techniques might be implemented in most patients and the more invasive or time-consuming in more complex patients at higher risk. We encourage clinicians to become familiar with technical details and physiological rationale of each for optimal implementation.","Telias, Irene; Spadaro, Savino",Current opinion in critical care,315,19

Therefore, an effort should be made to improve the quality and robustness of the annotation despite of the challenges, especially when final identification with standards is not possible. Through non-targeted analysis of human plasma samples, from a large cancer cohort study using RP-LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS, we have resolved MS/MS annotation through spectral matching, directed to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and, MS/MS structural elucidation for newly annotated oxidized lyso-phosphatidylcholines (oxLPCs). The annotation of unknowns is supported with structural information from fragmentation spectra as well as the fragmentation mechanisms involved, necessarily including data from both polarity modes and different collision energies. In this work, we present evidences that various oxidation products show significant differences between cancer patients and control individuals and we establish a workflow to help identify such modifications. We report here the upregulation of HETEs and oxLPCs in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to determine HETEs in NETs and one of very few studies where oxLPCs are annotated. The obtained results provide an important insight regarding lipid oxidation in NETs, although their physiological functions still have to be established and require further research.","López-López, Ángeles; Godzien, Joanna; Soldevilla, Beatriz; Gradillas, Ana; López-Gonzálvez, Ángeles; Lens-Pardo, Alberto; La Salvia, Anna; Del Carmen Riesco-Martínez, María; García-Carbonero, Rocío; Barbas, Coral",Journal of chromatography.

Some states and regional organizations, including in Asia, have begun to regard infectious disease as a national and international security issue. This article seeks to examine the Vietnamese government's response to the epidemics of avian influenza and Human immunodeficiency virus. Both diseases have been recognized at different times as threats to international security and both are serious infectious disease problems in Vietnam. Yet, the character of the central government's response to these two epidemics has been starkly different. How and why this disparity in policy approaches occurs depends largely on the epidemiological, economic and political context in which they occur. Although epidemiological factors are frequently explored when discussing disease as a security issue, seldom are the political, social and economic characteristics of the state invoked. These dimensions, and their interaction with the epidemiology of the disease, are central to understanding which diseases are ultimately treated by states as security issues. In particular, the role of economic security as a powerful motivator for resistance to control measures and the role that local implementation of policies can have in disrupting the effect of central government policy are explored. In exploring both the outcomes of securitization, and its facilitating conditions, I suggest some preliminary observations on the potential costs and benefits of securitizing infectious disease and its utility as a mechanism for protecting health in Asia.","Herington, Jonathan",Health policy and planning,315,1

However, with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), both delivery and uptake of radiolabeled peptides can be visualized in a neuroendocrine tumor model overexpressing somatostatin receptors. A heterogeneous peptide uptake is often observed in these tumors. We hypothesized that peptide distribution in the tumor is spatially related to tumor perfusion, vessel density and permeability, as imaged and quantified by DCE-MRI in a neuroendocrine tumor model. Four subcutaneous CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats were injected with the somatostatin-analog (111)In-DTPA-Octreotide (50 MBq). SPECT-CT and MRI scans were acquired and MRI was spatially registered to SPECT-CT. DCE-MRI was analyzed using semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. Correlation between SPECT and DCE-MRI was investigated with 1) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; 2) SPECT uptake values grouped into deciles with corresponding median DCE-MRI parametric values and vice versa; and 3) linear regression analysis for median parameter values in combined datasets. In all tumors, areas with low peptide uptake correlated with low perfusion/density/ /permeability for all DCE-MRI-derived parameters. Combining all datasets, highest linear regression was found between peptide uptake and semi-quantitative parameters (R(2)>0.7). The average correlation coefficient between SPECT and DCE-MRI-derived parameters ranged from 0.52-0.56 (p<0.05) for parameters primarily associated with exchange between blood and extracellular extravascular space. For these parameters a linear relation with peptide uptake was observed. In conclusion, the 'exchange-related' DCE-MRI-derived parameters seemed to predict peptide uptake better than the 'contrast amount- related' parameters. Consequently, fast and efficient diffusion through the vessel wall into tissue is an important factor for peptide delivery. DCE-MRI helps to elucidate the relation between vascular characteristics, peptide delivery and treatment efficacy, and may form a basis to predict targeting efficiency.","Bol, Karin; Haeck, Joost C; Groen, Harald C; Niessen, Wiro J; Bernsen, Monique R; de Jong, Marion; Veenland, Jifke F",PloS one,315,1

We set out to investigate how the early secretory pathway interacts with the RVN and the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) that is anchored to it. When the secretory pathway was disrupted by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment at the start of infection, RVN formation and viral RTC activity were not blocked and continued up to 11 h postinfection, although RNA synthesis was reduced by ca. 80%. In vitro RTC assays, using membrane fractions from infected cells, demonstrated that BFA does not directly interfere with the activity of the viral RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Confocal microscopy studies showed that early secretory pathway components are not associated with SARS-CoV-induced replication sites, although our studies revealed that infection induces a remarkable redistribution of the translocon subunit Sec61alpha. Ultrastructural studies, including electron tomography, revealed that the formation of the RVN and all its previously documented features can occur in the presence of BFA, despite differences in the volume and morphology of the network. We therefore conclude that early secretory pathway proteins do not play a direct role in RVN morphogenesis or the functionality of the SARS-CoV RTC. The BFA-induced disruption of ER integrity and functionality probably affects the overall quality of the membrane scaffold that is needed to support the viral RTC and/or the availability of specific host factors, which in turn compromises viral RNA synthesis.","Knoops, Kèvin; Swett-Tapia, Cindy; van den Worm, Sjoerd H E; Te Velthuis, Aartjan J W; Koster, Abraham J; Mommaas, A Mieke; Snijder, Eric J; Kikkert, Marjolein",Journal of virology,315,0

Despite this progress, deep jejunal enteral access remains a difficult procedure, and many endoscopists do not have experience with the techniques of nasojejunal (NJ) placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEGJ), or direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (DPEJ) (Shike and Latkany, Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am. 8:569-80, 1998). The difference between an exasperating experience and a rewarding procedure lies in mastering the ""tips and tricks"" that make insertion easy. While the basic techniques are described elsewhere (McClave and Chang 2011), we review several universal basic principles to enhance deep jejunal access, which should promote a more efficient and successful procedure.","Palmer, Lena B; McClave, Stephen A; Bechtold, Matthew L; Nguyen, Douglas L; Martindale, Robert G; Evans, David C",Current gastroenterology reports,315,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-three patients (mean age, 61 years; 43 males and 30 females) who underwent single-level partial hemilaminectomy of the lumbar spine without postoperative complications or other level spinal abnormalities between January 2010 and December 2018 were enrolled. Two musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated transiting nerve rootlet abnormalities (thickening, signal alteration, distinction, and displacement), epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis on MRI obtained one year after the operations. A spine surgeon blinded to the radiologic findings evaluated each patient for PPP. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between the MRI findings and PPP. RESULTS The presence of transiting nerve rootlet thickening, signal alteration, and ill-distinction was significantly different between the patients with PPP and those without, for both readers (p ≤ 0.020). Conversely, the presence of transiting nerve rootlet displacement, epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis was not significantly different between the two groups (p ≥ 0.128). Among the above radiologic findings, transiting nerve rootlet thickening and signal alteration were the most significant findings in the multivariate analyses (p ≤ 0.009). CONCLUSION On MRI, PPP was associated with transiting nerve rootlet abnormalities, including thickening, signal alterations, and ill-distinction, but was not associated with epidural fibrosis or intrathecal arachnoiditis. The most relevant findings were the nerve rootlet thickening and signal alteration.","Park, Chankue; Lee, In Sook; Nam, Kyoung Hyup; Song, You Seon; Lee, Tae Hong; Han, In Ho; Kim, Dong Hwan",Korean journal of radiology,315,1

This short report is a narrative review of our tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) perspective and experience managing the evolving outbreak situation. Logistic considerations included the segregation of the ED into physically separate high-risk, intermediate-risk and low-risk areas, with risk-adapted use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel in each ED area. Workflow considerations included the progressive introduction of outpatient COVID-19 testing in the ED for enhanced surveillance; adapting the admissions process particularly for high-risk and intermediate-risk cases; and the management of unwell accompanying adult caregivers. Manpower considerations included the reorganisation of medical manpower into modular teams to mitigate the risk of hospital transmission of COVID-19. Future plans for a tiered isolation facility should include structural modifications for the permanent isolation facility such as anterooms for PPE donning/doffing; replication of key ED functions in the tent facility such as a separate resuscitation room and portable X-ray room; and refresher PPE training.

BACKGROUND Early DAPT suspension after percutaneous coronary intervention increases the risk for major adverse cardiac events. However, temporal variability in risk and relation to DAPT cessation patterns among patients with DM remain unclear. METHODS Using data from the PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Anti-Platelet Regimens in Stented Patients) registry, 1,430 patients with DM (34%) and 2,777 without DM (66%) treated with drug-eluting stents were identified. DAPT cessation modes were classified as temporary interruption (<14 days), disruption because of bleeding or poor compliance, and physician-recommended discontinuation. RESULTS During 2-year follow-up, DM was associated with an increased risk for thrombotic events but a similar risk for bleeding. The cumulative incidence of DAPT cessation was significantly lower in patients with versus those without DM (50.1% vs. 55.4%; p < 0.01), driven largely by less frequent physician-guided discontinuation beyond 1 year. In contrast, 2-year rates of interruption and disruption were similar between groups. When DAPT was interrupted or discontinued under physician guidance, the risk for major adverse cardiac events was unchanged compared with patients with DM on uninterrupted DAPT. Conversely, when DAPT was disrupted, the risk for major adverse cardiac events increased compared with uninterrupted DAPT, regardless of diabetic status, with no evidence of statistical interaction. CONCLUSIONS DAPT cessation patterns vary according to diabetic status, with less frequent physician-guided discontinuation among patients with DM. The presence of DM does not emerge as a modifier of cardiovascular risk after DAPT cessation.","Faggioni, Michela; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Giustino, Gennaro; Cohen, David J; Henry, Timothy D; Farhan, Serdar; Ariti, Cono; Dangas, George; Gibson, Michael; Giacoppo, Daniele; Krucoff, Mitchell W; Aquino, Melissa; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Moliterno, David J; Colombo, Antonio; Vogel, Birgit; Chieffo, Alaide; Kini, Annapoorna S; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Weisz, Giora; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Pocock, Stuart; Mehran, Roxana",JACC.

The new report is the first to correspond to the requirements of the new Directive 2010/63/EU. Beside minor problems in reporting, the new reporting format is a major step forward, with additional new categories like severity allowing insight into animal use related questions that goes far beyond the previous reports. An in-depth analysis confirms a slight decrease in animal use from 2015 to 2017, but also compared to the 2005, 2008 and 2011 reports, though the new reporting scheme makes this comparison difficult. Notable success is evident for replacing rabbit pyrogen testing but, in general, the implementation of accepted alternative methods lags behind expec-tations. Beside the roughly 10 million animals per year covered in the report, about 8 million animals were identified that fall under the Directive but are not included in this number.

151272,151272,151272,What About the Flu?,15.082045,6.632588,2020-04-01,"OBJECTIVE Myotonia is caused by involuntary firing of skeletal muscle action potentials and causes debilitating stiffness. Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically-induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically-induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically-induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy. METHODS We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically-induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended ex vivo studies of excitability to in vivo studies of muscle stiffness. RESULTS As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically-induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4-null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically-induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically-induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia in vivo by approximately 80%. INTERPRETATION These data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically- and mechanically-induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia in vivo. Elimination of mechanically-induced myotonia by TRPV4 inhibition offers a new approach to treating myotonia. This article is protected by copyright.

It is known that chronic cardiovascular diseases are associated with the risk of severe course and lethal outcomes both in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, in each case it is necessary to study the interaction and mutual influence of different components of the treatment program prescribed to such patients.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of coagulation activity on the course of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and to justify the management of comorbid patients having been received novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in previously selected doses according to indications in concomitant somatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Total 76 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in patients who had been received initial therapy on an outpatient basis were analyzed. 26 patients who received NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) made up the main group and 50 - the comparison (control) group in which patients had not been administered any drugs that affect blood clotting until the episode of COVID-19. All patients have been prescribed therapy following the Provisional guidelines «Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)» (https://static-0.minzdrav.gov.ru/system/attachments/attaches/). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The number of hospitalizations was significantly fewer in the group of patients who had been received NOACs (19 vs. 66% in the control group). No deaths or cases of severe respiratory and/or renal failure were observed in the main group, while adverse outcomes were noted in 14% of patients who had not been administered these drugs. CONCLUSION Taking NOACs reduces the probability of severe course and adverse outcomes in the development of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, which indicates a significant contribution of coagulation mechanisms to the pathogenesis in COVID-19. There were no indications for drug replacement and correction of anticoagulant therapy regimens in patients who received adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants for treating a non-severe form of coronavirus infection in ambulatory patient settings.","Ruzhentsova, T A; Khavkina, D A; Chukhliaev, P V; Garbuzov, A A; Ploskireva, A A",Voprosy virusologii,315,16

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The outcomes of interest of this literature review were mental health, suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and violence. Exposures of interest were TOOC, TIPA or a partial or indirect measure of either. In total, 14 studies were included. An abbreviated review methodology was used because of time constraints. FINDINGS There was consistent evidence of an association between lower TOOC and TIPA and worse mental health and higher suicide risk. Limited evidence suggests a link between TOOC and DSH. No evidence was identified regarding the relationship between TOOC/TIPA and violence. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS A lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions regarding causality. Significant heterogeneity of mental health outcomes limits the comparability of studies.

Despite knowledge of nutritional risk, there is little uniformity of postoperative vitamin and mineral supplementation. The objective of this study was to evaluate a composite supplement based on the clinical practice guidelines proposed in 2008 regarding vitamin and mineral supplementation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The composite included iron (Fe) and calcium as well. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 309 patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) was evaluated for the development of deficiencies in iron and vitamins A, B1, B12, and D. Patients were instructed to take a custom vitamin and mineral supplement that was based on society-approved guidelines. The clinical practice guidelines were modified to include 1600 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 instead of the recommended 800 IU. RESULTS The compliant patients' deficiency rates were significantly lower than those of the noncompliant patients for iron (p = 0.001), vitamin A (p = 0.01), vitamin B12 (p ≈ 0.02), and vitamin D (p < 0.0001). Women's menstrual status did not significantly influence the development of iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS Use of a composite based on guidelines proposed by the AACE, TOS, and the ASMBS appears to be effective for preventing iron and vitamins A, B1, B12, and D deficiencies in the LRYGB patients during the first postoperative year. Separation of calcium and Fe does not need to be mandatory.

RESULTS The primary effectiveness of RFA was 83% (complete radiographic response). RFA was associated with a longer median wait time to transplant (9.5 vs. 5 months). Tumour-specific drop-off events were equivalent between RFA (21%) and No Treatment (12%) groups (P= 0.11).

Furthermore, there were no differences in 5-year overall or tumour-free survivals from list date or transplant. Using multivariate analysis, the likelihood of receiving a transplant and patient survivals were associated with tumour characteristics (AFP, tumour number and size) and not with bridge therapy or waiting time.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations are hallmarks of immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases. We have previously performed high resolution HLA genotyping and detected associations between ME/CFS and certain HLA class I and class II alleles. However, the HLA complex harbors numerous genes of immunological importance, and there is extensive and complex linkage disequilibrium across the region. In the current study, we aimed to fine map the association signals in the HLA complex by genotyping five additional classical HLA loci and 5,342 SNPs in 427 Norwegian ME/CFS patients, diagnosed according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria, and 480 healthy Norwegian controls. SNP association analysis revealed two distinct and independent association signals (p≤0.001) tagged by rs4711249 in the HLA class I region and rs9275582 in the HLA class II region. Furthermore, the primary association signal in the HLA class II region was located within the HLA-DQ gene region, most likely due to HLA-DQB1, particularly the amino acid position 57 (aspartic acid/alanine) in the peptide binding groove, or an intergenic SNP upstream of HLA-DQB1. In the HLA class I region, the putative causal locus might map outside the classical HLA genes as the association signal spans several genes (DDR1, GTF2H4, VARS2, SFTA2 and DPCR1) with expression levels influenced by the ME/CFS associated SNP genotype. Taken together, our results implicate the involvement of the MHC, and in particular the HLA-DQB1 gene, in ME/CFS. These findings should be replicated in larger cohorts, particularly to verify the putative involvement of HLA-DQB1, a gene important for antigen-presentation to T cells and known to harbor alleles providing the largest risk for well-established autoimmune diseases.","Hajdarevic, Riad; Lande, Asgeir; Rekeland, Ingrid; Rydland, Anne; Strand, Elin B; Sosa, Daisy D; Creary, Lisa E; Mella, Olav; Egeland, Torstein; Saugstad, Ola D; Fluge, Øystein; Lie, Benedicte A; Viken, Marte K","Brain, behavior, and immunity",315,5

We hypothesized that hemodialysis patients were decreasing their hospital visits and increasing their dialysis adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of hemodialysis patients treated in the seven American Renal Associates (ARA) dialysis centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. We conducted a ""before-and-after"" study using existing clinical data to examine patient adherence with hemodialysis between January 1 and March 14, 2020 (pre-COVID) and March 15 to May 18, 2020 (COVID) time periods. Data points included missed treatments, shortened treatments, post-dialysis weight, and hospital visits. Finally, we conducted an anonymous survey in which patients reported their hemodialysis adherence. RESULTS Data analysis was performed on 556 patients. Significantly fewer patients missed a single treatment in the COVID vs. pre-COVID time periods (44.1 vs. 58.6%; p < 0.001). Significantly fewer patients finished their treatment with a post-dialysis weight more than 1 kg above their estimated dry weight in the COVID vs. pre-COVID time periods (31.7 vs. 38.9%, p = 0.01).

Bioassays in gerbils and molecular techniques (PCR-RFLP) were used for identification of the oocysts shed by experimentally infected dogs. Sporulated oocysts were purified and divided into 11 treatment groups as follows: absolute ethanol for 1 hr; 20 C for 6 hr; 4 C for 6 hr; 60 C for 1 min; 100 C for 1 min; 10% formaldehyde for 1 hr; 10% ammonia for 1 hr; 2% iodine for 1 hr; 10% sodium hypochlorite for 1 hr; 70% ethanol for 1 hr; and one group was left untreated and kept as a positive control. All chemical treatments were performed at room temperature (37 C). A total of 33 gerbils, or 3 gerbils per treatment, were used for bioassays. After treatment, the oocysts were divided into aliquots of 1,000 oocysts and orally administered to gerbils. After 63 days, the gerbils were anesthetized and killed with 0.2 ml of T61; blood and tissue samples were collected for serological (IFAT and western blotting), molecular (real-time PCR), histopathology, and immunohistochemical tests. Treatments were considered effective only if all 5 detection techniques tested negative. High temperatures at 100 C for 1 min and 10% sodium hypochlorite for 1 hr were the only treatments that met this condition, effectively inactivating all oocysts.","Alves Neto, Aldo F; Bandini, Luciana A; Nishi, Sandra M; Soares, Rodrigo M; Driemeier, David; Antoniassi, Nadia A B; Schares, Gereon; Gennari, Solange M",The Journal of parasitology,315,27

New York City has the highest incidence in the United States and fully 45% of all deaths from COVID-19. Our medical center is located within a high-density region of cases in south Brooklyn and, in fact, three of our neighborhood zip codes are in the top seven in New York in incidence. As a result, our center has experienced a dramatic increase in hospitalizations, particularly respiratory distress secondary to COVID-19, which rapidly exceeded the capacity of our internal medicine service. This necessitated the formation of new COVID-19 units throughout the hospital, replacing all former service lines. These units employed management teams composed of residents from many medical and surgical disciplines, including general surgery residents. Methods: Our general surgery residency program established a surgical COVID-19 (SCOVID) management team. Initially, 4 surgical residents (2 senior and 2 junior), 1 attending surgeon, and 1 attending internal medicine physician were allocated to the initial SCOVID team. On day 3 of implementation, to achieve more rapid competence in the complex management of these patients, a senior medicine resident with direct experience in the care of COVID-19 patients was added in an advisory capacity. Results: The addition of an experienced senior medical resident and attending allowed for the quick adoption of uniform management protocols by surgical residents and attendings. Discussion: We describe a protocol for the establishment of COVID-19 management teams staffed with general surgical residents, as well as a strategy for the achievement of rapid increases in competency. The addition of a senior internal medicine resident and attending to our SCOVID team allowed for rapid achievement of competency in the care of COVID-19 patients in our large institution at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kangas-Dick, Aaron W; Diaz-Siso, J Rodrigo; Griffiths, Alexa; Khachane, Asha; Bilbro, Nicole; Hwang, Regina; Prien, Christopher; Chandler, Paul; Berman, Zoe; Dellituri, Antony; Gelfand, Inna; Roszokha, Victor; Borgen, Patrick I; Wiesel, Ory; Mongiu, Anne; Glithero, Kyle J; Rhee, Rebecca J",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

BACKGROUND Ablation for AF is a highly effective strategy; however, the risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke is approximately 0.5% to 1%. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging studies report a 7% to 14% prevalence of silent cerebral infarction. Whether cerebral ischemia results in POCD after ablation for AF is not well established. METHODS The study included 150 patients; 60 patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), 30 patients undergoing ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF), and 30 patients undergoing ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) were compared with a matched nonoperative control group of patients with AF awaiting radiofrequency ablation (n = 30). Eight neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at 2 days and 90 days post-operatively. The tests were administered at the same time points to the nonoperative control group. The reliable change index was used to calculate POCD. RESULTS The prevalences of POCD at day 2 post-procedure were 28% in patients with PAF, 27% in patients with PeAF, 13% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.007). At day 90, the prevalences of POCD were 13% in patients with PAF, 20% in patients with PeAF, 3% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.03). When analyzing the 3 procedural groups together, 29 of 120 patients (24%) manifested POCD at day 2 and 15 of 120 patients (13%) at day 90 post-procedure (p = 0.029). On univariate analysis, increasing left atrial access time was associated with POCD at day 2 (p = 0.04) and day 90 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Ablation for AF is associated with a 13% to 20% prevalence of POCD in patients with AF at long-term follow-up. These results were seen in a patient population with predominant CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack) scores of 0 to 1, representing the majority of patients undergoing ablation for AF. The long-term implications of these subtle changes require further study.","Medi, Caroline; Evered, Lisbeth; Silbert, Brendan; Teh, Andrew; Halloran, Karen; Morton, Joseph; Kistler, Peter; Kalman, Jonathan",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,315,1

We find that the gain of an amino-terminal caveolin binding motif (CBM) in the α subunit of the Na/K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (NKA) is required for the early stages of organogenesis in both mice and Caenorhabditis elegans. The evolutionary gain of the CBM occurred at the same time as the acquisition of the binding sites for Na+/K+. Loss of this CBM does not affect cell lineage specification or the initiation of organogenesis, but arrests further organ development. Mechanistically, this CBM is essential for the dynamic operation of Wnt and the timely up-regulation of transcriptional factors during organogenesis. These results indicate that the NKA was evolved as a dual functional protein that works in concert with Wnt as a hitherto unrecognized common mechanism to enable stem cell differentiation and organogenesis in multicellular organisms within the animal kingdom.","Wang, Xiaoliang; Cai, Liquan; Xie, Jeffrey X; Cui, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Jue; Wang, Jiayan; Chen, Yiliang; Larre, Isabel; Shapiro, Joseph I; Pierre, Sandrine V; Wu, Dianqing; Zhu, Guo-Zhang; Xie, Zijian",Science advances,315,1

The risk of a widespread epidemic is especially high when pathogens are introduced to naive host populations, often leading to high morbidity and mortality. Prevention and control of these epidemics is based on knowledge of what drives pathogen transmission among hosts. Previous disease outbreaks suggest the spread of directly transmitted pathogens is determined by host contact rates and local host density. While theoretical models of disease spread typically assume a constant host density, most wildlife populations occur at a variety of densities across the landscape. We explored how spatial heterogeneity in host density influences pathogen spread by simulating the introduction and spread of rabies and canine distemper in a spatially heterogeneous population of Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis), coupling fox density and contact rates with probabilities of viral transmission. For both diseases, the outcome of pathogen introductions varied widely among simulation iterations and depended on the density of hosts at the site of pathogen introduction. Introductions into areas of higher fox densities resulted in more rapid pathogen transmission and greater impact on the host population than if the pathogen was introduced at lower densities. Both pathogens were extirpated in a substantial fraction of iterations. Rabies was over five times more likely to go locally extinct when introduced at low host density sites than at high host-density sites, leaving an average of >99% of foxes uninfected. Canine distemper went extinct in >98% of iterations regardless of introduction site, but only after >90% of foxes had become infected. Our results highlight the difficulty in predicting the course of an epidemic, in part due to complex interactions between pathogen biology and host behavior, exacerbated by the spatial variation of most host populations.","Sanchez, Jessica N; Hudgens, Brian R",Biological conservation,315,1

The barbed suture is one of the various devices developed to simplify the placement of intracorporeal sutures. However, barbed sutures are not commonly used during reconstruction after radical gastrectomy in cancer patients or for single-layer entire-thickness running suturing for intestinal anastomoses. We describe the procedure for using barbed sutures and report on the short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS Between August 2012 and March 2014, 15-cm-long barbed sutures (V-Loc 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) were used for laparoscopic intestinal anastomoses, including intestinal hole closure for esophagojejunal and gastrojejunal anastomoses after mechanical anastomoses and gastric wall closure after partial resection. RESULTS In total, 38 patients underwent 40 laparoscopic anastomoses (esophagojejunostomies, 26; gastrojejunostomies, 7; and simple closure of gastric defect, 7); no cases required conversion to open surgery. Two cases exhibited positive air leak test results during surgery (1 case of esophagojejunostomy and 1 case of simple closure of gastric defect). Two cases of intestinal obstruction were noted; of those, one patient with postoperative intestinal paresis (grade II) was managed conservatively, and the other underwent repeat laparoscopic surgery (grade IIIb) for internal herniation unrelated to V-Loc use. No postoperative complications at the anastomosis site and no surgery-related deaths were noted. CONCLUSION Single-layer entire-thickness running suturing with the V-Loc 180 barbed suture after stapled side-to-side intestinal anastomosis was found to be safe and feasible in the reported cases.","Tsukada, Tomoya; Kaji, Masahide; Kinoshita, Jun; Shimizu, Koichi",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,315,31

Reliable measurement of these parameters would seem to be required for comparisons between devices, device selection at the time of clinical usage, as well as for research purposes. Because there is no standard method of measurement, our aim was to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of PD measurements and of three different ways of measuring porosity. METHODS Six microphotographs of two fully deployed FDs were taken overlying two different millimetric reference grids: one flat and the other corrected to match the cylindrical stent. Standardized protocols for independently measuring PD and porosity according to three different methods were used by three trained observers and by the same observer twice. Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to study the reliability of the measurements. RESULTS For porosity, satisfactory agreement occurred only when the same method of measurement was performed by the same observer. Intra-observer and inter-observer agreement were poor for measures of porosity when different methods were used (with differences in the range of 5-10%, ICC <0.6 for all methods). Measurement of PD was more reliable within (ICC 0.991 (0.946 to 0.999)) and between (ICC 0.945 (0.781 to 0.991)) observers. CONCLUSIONS Without standardization, the porosity of different devices cannot reliably be compared because use of different methods or different observers substantially changes results. Pore density seems to be more reliably measured than porosity.","Farzin, B; Brosseau, L; Jamali, S; Salazkin, I; Jack, A; Darsaut, T E; Raymond, J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,315,19

Currently available murine models are limited because wound contraction introduces bias into wound surface area measurements. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate utility of a human-mouse xenograft model for studying human wound healing. Normal human skin was harvested from elective abdominoplasty surgery, xenografted onto athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, and allowed to engraft for 3 months.

On the day of wound harvest, mice were injected with XenoLight RediJect cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) probe and imaged according to package instructions. Immunohistochemistry confirms that this human-mouse xenograft model is effective for studying human wound healing in vivo. Additionally, in vivo fluorescent imaging for inducible COX-2 demonstrated upregulation from baseline to day 4 (P = 0·03) with return to baseline levels by day 10, paralleling the reepithelialisation of the wound.

The purpose of this research was to determine whether an episode of aerobic exercise prior to practice improves the acquisition and retention of laparoscopic skills in the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) simulator. METHODS Baseline maximal physical fitness (VO2 max), performance on peg transfer (PT), pattern cut (PC), and intracorporeal suture (ICS) were measured for FLS naïve undergraduates. 2 Weeks later, participants were randomized into exercise (E) and control (C) groups. C did unrelated work for 40 min and then practiced PT and PC for 10 min, and ICS for 15 min. Final scores were recorded. In E, participants ran on a treadmill for 20 min at 60 % of their VO2 max. After a 15 min cool down, they engaged in identical FLS simulator training as group C. Both groups completed the NASA task load index (TLX) to assess workload. Retention was recorded 2 months after the training session. Groups were compared using t tests, χ(2) and Wilcoxon rank tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS There were 52 participants (22 in C; 30 in E) with high physical fitness at baseline. Demographics between the groups were similar at baseline. There were no differences in VO2 max and scores on the three tasks at baseline (all p values NS). There was no statistical significance between the scores of the C and E groups at the training session and retention, except for higher PT scores in the E group after the training session. CONCLUSION In physically fit, surgically naïve students, one bout of aerobic exercise enhanced immediate learning of simple FLS skills but did not have an impact on more complex skills or on retention. The use of exercise in the surgical curriculum, or as a learning tool, warrants further investigation regarding how best to apply it.","Chartrand, Geneviève; Kaneva, Pepa; Kolozsvari, Nicoleta; Li, Chao; Petrucci, Andrea M; Mutter, Andrew F; Daskalopoulou, Stella S; Carli, Franco; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,315,1

This audit aims to assess the frequency and severity of pulmonary embolism in 2020 compared to 2019. METHODS In this retrospective audit, we compared computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) frequency and pulmonary embolism severity in April and May 2020, compared to 2019. Pulmonary embolism severity was assessed with the Modified Miller score and the presence of right heart strain was assessed. Demographic information and 30-day mortality was identified from electronic health records. RESULTS In April 2020, there was a 17% reduction in the number of CTPA performed and an increase in the proportion identifying pulmonary embolism (26%, n = 68/265 vs 15%, n = 47/320, p < 0.001), compared to April 2019. Patients with pulmonary embolism in 2020 had more comorbidities (p = 0.026), but similar age and sex compared to 2019. There was no difference in pulmonary embolism severity in 2020 compared to 2019, but there was an increased frequency of right heart strain in May 2020 (29 vs 12%, p = 0.029). Amongst 18 patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism, there was a larger proportion of males and an increased 30 day mortality (28% vs 6%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in the number of CTPA scans performed and an increase in the frequency of CTPA scans positive for pulmonary embolism.

The existence and uniqueness of the solutions for the fractional model is proved using fixed point theorem, the model are shown to have two equilibrium point (disease free and an endemic equilibrium). Some numerical simulations using Euler method are also carried out to support our theoretical results. We estimated the value of the fractional orders and the parameters of the proposed model using the least squares method. Further, the sensitivity analysis of the parameter is performed as a result, our incommensurate model gives a good approximation to real data of COVID-19.","ALLA HAMOU, A.; AZROUL, E.; Hammouch, Z.; Lamrani alaoui, A.",,315,24

Indeed, it has been suggested that the death rate in developing countries may be far lower than in high-income countries - an outcome that would be starkly different from the typical pattern for many other infectious diseases. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature to identify all serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples of specimens collected by early 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analyzed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible. Results Seroprevalence in many developing country locations was markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity. In most locations, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age-groups. Age-specific IFRs were 1.3-2.5x higher than in high-income countries. The median value of population IFR was 0.5% among developing countries with satisfactory death reporting as of 2016, compared to a median of 0.05% for other developing countries. Conclusion The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare. These results underscore the critical need to accelerate the provision of vaccine doses to vulnerable populations in developing countries.","Levin, A. T.; Owusu-Boaitey, N.; Pugh, S.; Fosdick, B.

In particular, the molecular data enable to characterize novel species yet unknown and to increase the information linked to those already observed with new genomic data. For this reason, the management and visualization of existing molecular data, and their related metadata, through the implementation of easy to use IT tools have become a key point for the development of future research. The more users are able to access biodiversity related information, the greater the ability of the scientific community to expand the knowledge in this area. Results In our research we have focused on the development of ExTaxsI (Exploring Taxonomies Information), an IT tool able to retrieve biodiversity data stored in NCBI databases and provide a simple and explorable visualization. Through the three case studies presented here, we have shown how an efficient organization of the data already present can lead to obtaining new information that is fundamental as a starting point for new research. Our approach was also able to highlight the limits in the distribution data availability, a key factor to consider in the experimental design phase of broad spectrum studies, such as metagenomics. Conclusions ExTaxI can easily produce explorable visualization of molecular data and its metadata, with the aim to help researchers to improve experimental designs and highlight the main gaps in the coverage of available data.","Agostinetto, Giulia; Sandionigi, Anna; Chahed, Adam; Brusati, Alberto; Parladori, Elena; Balech, Bachir; Bruno, Antonia; Pescini, Dario; Casiraghi, Maurizio",bioRxiv,315,1

We investigated the diagnostic and therapeutic status of breast malignancy before and after the COVID-19 pandemic at the multi-institution level. Methods: We have reviewed the records of patients with breast cancer from February 2019 to July 2020 in six university hospitals in Korea. The patients were divided into two groups according to the initial date of cancer diagnosis: Period A, from February to April and Period B, from May to July in 2020. The two groups were compared for the same periods in 2019. The goals were to determine whether breast cancer screening and diagnosis have been delayed and thus resulted in stage migration. We also examined the difference in the number of surgeries in patients diagnosed with breast cancer during those periods. Results: The total of 1,669 breast malignancy diagnosis was made in the grouped periods of 2019, and 1,369 diagnoses in 2020. All patients were screened by PCR test for COVID-19 prior to hospitalization, and none of them tested positive. Overall, there was a 9.9% reduction in the number of diagnoses than in 2019 and the decrease was more significant in Period A (11.1% vs. 8.7%). According to the age, there was no difference until the 30s but decreased from those in their 40s and above. The decline was more pronounced in the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected breast cancer screening (decreased by 27.4%) and more diminished in Period A (41.0% vs. 19.0%). Invasive breast cancer stage was not statistically different in Period A compare with 2019 (p = 0.170). But the stage in Period B was different (p = 0.032), and more patients were observed in advanced stages in 2020. The decrease in surgery was noticeably observed in Period A (4.6%, from 480 to 438 surgeries) and not in Period B. The analysis of reconstruction surgery was similar. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 increased exponentially from late February in Korea. However, the number of patients per day decreased to less than 100 on March 15 and then flattened. The health care system for cancer was not overloaded and restrictions on visiting hospital were minimal. Analysis in the pandemic period of the 6-month showed that the number of breast cancer screening, diagnosis and surgeries decreased compared with the previous year. Those decreases were prominent in Period A when the COVID-19 patient surged. The upstage migration of breast cancer was generally insignificant but slightly occurred in Period B. The outbreak of infectious disease makes patients reluctant to come to the hospital, especially in the elderly. We need to discuss the potential long-lasting deleterious effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer diagnosis and management. And we should prepare for how to deal with the backlog caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kang, Y. J.; Oh, S. J.; Baek, J. M.; Kim, Y.; Jeon, Y. W.; Yoo, T. K.; Rhu, J.; Shin, C.

The situation urges us to face many issues never experienced before, aimed at mitigating a multitude of sanitary and social risks. The current pandemic has affected the food system in many ways: significant changes in dietary habits and in the health status of people;the food chain is broken, which has an effect on food security (including making it difficult to find or to buy fresh food at affordable prices);unemployment or underemployment is rising due to the damages of the food sector;there is a lack of food‐socialising events which has an effect on people’s mental status;and there are concerns about food safety. To mitigate all these issues, the implementation of innovative technologies urges. We have mapped the scientific studies and online information on 3D food printing (3DFP) about the effects of 3DFP on the food system and people’s health when adopted in food industry, restaurants, hospitals, schools, offices, homes, etc. Finally, this information has been examined in light to the future challenges of the food chain also considering the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, demonstrating its potential benefits to mitigate this and future pandemics.

While the significance of sustainability education has continuously improved by raising awareness among new generations of students, it has not adequately promoted pro-environmental behaviors or attitude changes. This research study used a linear pretest–posttest experimental approach to understand whether two codesigned interventions;a trash and recycling bin system, and a Materials Exchange program, could improve sustainability literacy and material conservation behaviors across the School of Design. Additionally, a mid-experiment focus group study was conducted to provide text-rich data for analysis of 3R behaviors. Analysis of the data collected revealed that these interventions were reasonably successful in improving responsible material management. To have a greater impact on sustainable behavior, it is suggested that a formal educational experience should supplement the informal interventions described in this paper to onboard students as they enter the design studio culture. Additionally, the expansion of the trash and recycling bin station system into the university dormitories is discussed. This work has successfully catalyzed a collaboration between all School of Design stakeholders to address studio waste in a tangible way.","Manfredi, Louise R.; Stokoe, Meriel Kelly Rebecca Lee Seyeon",Sustainability,315,16

Attempts have been made in the present study in order to identify the population displacement pattern of the study region using taxis’ origin and destination data, and then model the parameters affecting the population displacement pattern and provide an ultimate model in order to predict pick-up and drop-off locations. In this way, the passenger pick-up and drop-off locations have been identified in order to obtain the population movement pattern. In this study, Moran’s I index was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis was used to analyze spatial patterns of pick-up and drop-off locations. Effective parameters modeling was performed using the Poisson regression. The results of the spatiotemporal distribution map for pick-up and drop-off locations indicated a similarity in patterns and equal results for some locations. Results also indicated different features of spatial distribution during different hours of the day. Spatial autocorrelation analysis results indicated a low probability of randomness in the general spatial distribution of the locations. The result of modeling the parameters shows the positive effect of the parameters on the pattern of population movement, and according to the p-value of 0.000, Poisson regression is significant for the pick-up and drop-off locations. The modeling results also highlighted the importance of movement patterns in recognizing urban hot spots, which is valuable for policymakers and urban planners.","Rahimi, Fatema Sadeghi-Niaraki Abolghasem Ghodousi Mostafa Soo-Mi Choi",Applied Sciences,315,28

Renin from the kidneys converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The activation of AT1 receptors by angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, an increase in aldosterone secretion, and an increase in the reabsorption of sodium ions in nephrons, leading to elevation of the blood pressure. Angiotensin II promotes oxidative stress, growth and proliferation of cells, stimulates coagulation, inhibits fibrinolysis, and intensifies inflammatory processes. The ACE-angiotensin II-AT1R pathway is balanced by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which degrades angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9) pathways exert protective effects by activating, respectively Mas and AT2 receptors. ACE and ACE2 also have intimate roles with the plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), a hormonal pathway that modulates the intrinsic blood coagulation system, endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis, the complement pathway and RAS. The appearance in Wuhan, China, of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections at the end of 2019 launched a series of intensive studies, which proved that the virus invades host cells using ACE2 as a specific receptor. This survey presents basic information on the structure and tissue distribution of ACE2 and the role this enzyme plays in pathogenesis of COVID-19. A particular emphasis is given to pathophysiological effects of the functional superiority of the ACE → angiotensin II → AT1 receptor axis over the pathway ACE2 → angiotensin II → angiotensin (1-7) → Mas receptor. Such disharmony is a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 induced ACE2-downregulation. In the era of the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, intensive research is conducted not only on vaccines and antiviral drugs, but also on compounds that can restore the functional balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1-7). © 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

By applying the principles of small-area estimation to existing models formulations for excess mortality, this study develops a method for assessing excess mortality across small populations and assesses the pattern of COVID excess mortality by province, year, week, age group, and sex in Italy from March through May 2020. We estimate that 53,200 excess deaths occurred across Italy during this time period, compared to just 35,500 deaths where COVID-19 was registered as the underlying cause of death. Out of the total excess mortality burden, 97% of excess deaths occurred among adults over age 60, and 68% of excess deaths were concentrated among adults over age 80. The burden of excess mortality was unevenly distributed across the country, with just three of Italy's 107 provinces accounting for 32% of all excess mortality. This method for estimating excess mortality can be adapted to other countries where COVID-19 diagnostic capacity is still insufficient, and could be incorporated into public health rapid response systems.","Henry, N.

Objectives: To assess whether pharmacist-based virtual health coaching sessions could increase the proportion of people who practised healthy social behaviors, to test whether this model can increase the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, and to measure whether these behaviors could actually prevent contracting COVID-19. Method: In this randomized controlled trial, adults who matched specific criteria were randomly allocated into 2 arms. The active arm received 12 pharmacist-based virtual coaching sessions delivered via Zoom® over a month. Participants allocated to the control arm received no coaching. At the end of the last coaching session, both groups were asked to complete a structured questionnaire for outcome assessment. Participants in the active group were followed up to 2 weeks after the end of the last coaching session to check if they contracted COVID-19 or not. The SPSS software version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 300 participants who gave consent for participation, 295 completed the study (147 from the active arm and 148 from the control arm). The proportion of those using face masks, avoiding crowds, and willing to be isolated if infected in the active arm was increased from 51.70%, 53.74%, and 59.86% at baseline to 91.83%, 80.27%, and 96.59% at the end of coaching, respectively (all with P &lt; .05). In addition, the proportion of behaviors, such as disinfecting surfaces, not touching the T-zone, and avoid sharing personal belongings with colleagues at work was increased from 36.05%, 27.89%, and 46.93% at baseline to 63.94%, 52.38%, and 87.75% at the end of coaching, respectively (all with P &lt; .05). Avoid touching the T-zone (OR = 0.43;95% CI, 0.24-0.89) and using disposable tissues (OR = 0.30;95% CI, 0.18-0.77), each versus using face masks appropriately were more likely to get COVID-19.

Methods: Data of 665 SpA patients and confirmed Covid infection seen in our center from March 15th to December 15th was crossed. 3 miscoded patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 2 with non definite CLIA positivity were excluded. Finally 49 patients' clinical records were reviewed. Data regarding epidemiologic features, SpA characteristics, comorbidities, therapy received, clinical activity before and after Covid, and severity of the infection was collected. IBM SPSS v23 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Among 49 SpA patients, 59% were male, mean aged 56,63 years (range 23-79). 62,2% presented at least 1 comorbidity. 65% were psoriatic arthritis. They mostly had longstanding disease (median 10,5 years -range-1-35). Previously 63% had received DMARDs, mainly methotrexate, and 32 % BT. When Covid was diagnosed 37,2% were under DMARDs and 53% under BT (69,2% TNF inhibitors, 26,9% anti-Il 17, 3,9% ustekinumab). At this point, disease activity was controlled in 82% of patients (39% in remission, and 43% in low disease activity state). Only 18% showed moderate activity. Within the 49 patients, 34 were diagnosed by PCR and 15 by CLIA tests. 9 required hospitalisation, of whom 4 developed more severe disease (3 received glucocorticoid pulses and 2 tocilizumab). A woman with PsA under secukinumab presented pneumonia and PE. None required mechanical ventilation. There were no exitus. Due to Covid infection 9 patients (50%) stopped DMARDs treatment, (5 of them hospitalised). 9 patients withdrew BT after Covid diagnosis;60% of the BT-hospitalised, and 28.5% of the BT-non-hospitalised. 1 suffered a flow with severe disease activity after withdrawal of Il-17 inhibitor. Conclusion: Prevalence of SARS cov 2 infection in SpA patients was not greater than in general population. Most were asymptomatic or suffered mild disease. Only 9 were hospitalised. Factors related to hospitalisation seem similar to those of general population, even if statistical significance was not found due to the small sample. BT does not seem to relate to hospitalisation in SpA and we had no deaths to date in them.","Garcia Gomez, C. L.; Montero, D.; Vega, L.; Ibarguengoitia, O.; Calvo, I.; Perez, C. E.; Blanco, J.

In spite of this, the expected gains of offshoring can be offset by hidden costs and risks, such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade war between the USA and China, and the ongoing trade dispute between Korea and Japan. To obviate such business failure and prevent critical business blunders, offshoring strategies that efficiently consider both risk elements and potential wealth creation are urgently need. The first purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of more advanced offshoring strategies to help host countries select the best locations to manage supply chain risks and create unique value. The second purpose is to specifically analyze the current status of Korea and provide Korean companies with implications to be considered when deciding whether to offshore or re-shore. Design/methodology - A Network DEA model was applied to measure the comparative location efficiency of national competencies for offshoring strategy from perspectives of wealth creation opportunities (profitability and marketability) and supply chain risk management. The location efficiencies are compared among a total 70 countries selected from the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and globally attractive locations outlined by Kearney (2017). For the secondary analysis of efficiency, a t-test examining the nature of competitive advantage and the level of sophistication in production processes was implemented in three divisions. We then analyzed differences in offshoring performance in terms of the identified national traits. Moreover, Tobit regression analysis is conducted to investigate the correlation between value-added business activities and each divisional efficiency, seeking to determine how each degree of value-added business activity influences the increase in offshoring productivity. Findings - Regarding overall location efficiency for offshoring performance, only the USA and Italy were identified as being efficient as host countries for offshoring, under circumstances of advanced development, such as productivity and risk management. Korea ranks 13th among 70 countries. The determinants of national competitiveness depend on national traits (the nature of competitive advantage and business sophistication). Countries with labor/resource advantages and labor-intensive industries are more competitive in terms of marketability than others. In contrast, countries with strong technology-intensive industries benefit offshoring companies, particularly in the technology sector, with the added advantage of supply chain risk management. As the perception of a value chain is broader in a country, it can achieve both production sophistication and competitive advantages such as marketability and SCRM. Originality/value - Existing studies focus on offshoring effectiveness from a company perspective. This paper contributes to comparing country efficiency in producing core competencies related to an offshoring strategy and also segments countries into three performance-based considerations associated with the global offshoring market. It also details Korea's position as an offshoring location according to national efficiency and competency.","Ma, J. H.; Ahn, Y. H.",Journal of Korea Trade,315,1

The pandemic sprouting from China has created an uncertain situation globally. The rapid prevalence of this infectious agent has severely paralyzed every discipline of life at the domestic and international global levels within a few months after onset. The exponential growth of COVID-19 infected admissions in hospitals has oversaturated hospitals capacity, especially in developing and third world countries. Despite efforts of global communities and organizations, several developed countries are especially more affected due to a good economy and more intercontinental traveling. Due to extensive geographical spread, rapid transmission inclination, and severity of disease caused by COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"". The ripple influence of this pandemic has brought potential challenges to worldwide health-care systems. It might trigger a ""far-reaching"" global economic crisis if the virus spread is not strictly curbed. Therefore, the scientific concern has heightened on this novel Corona virus.

Although evidenced based treatments are available, at least 15% of children remain symptomatic after one year of treatment. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an alternative therapy option; however, little is known about whether it is an acceptable treatment approach. Our aim was to find out if children who are still disabled by CFS/ME after 12 months of treatment would find ACT acceptable, to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of ACT. Methods We recruited children (diagnosed with CFS/ME; not recovered after one year of treatment; aged 11-17 years), their parent/carer, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) from one specialist UK paediatric CFS/ME service. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore barriers to recovery; views on current treatments; acceptability of ACT; and feasibility of using an RCT to test effectiveness. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns in data. Results Twelve adolescents, eleven parents, and seven HCPs were interviewed. All participants thought ACT was acceptable. Participants identified reasons why ACT might be efficacious: pragmatism, acceptance and compassion are valued in chronic illness; values-focussed treatment provides motivation and direction; psychological and physical needs are addressed; normalising difficulties is a useful life-skill. Some adolescents preferred ACT to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as it encouraged accepting (rather than challenging) thoughts. Most adolescents would consent to an RCT of ACT but a barrier to recruitment was reluctance to randomisation. All HCPs deemed ACT feasible to deliver. Some were concerned patients might confuse 'acceptance' with 'giving up' and called for clear explanations. All participants thought the timing of ACT should be individualised. Conclusions All adolescents with CFS/ME, parents, and HCPs thought ACT was acceptable, and most adolescents were willing to try ACT. An RCT needs to solve issues around randomisation and timing of the intervention.","Clery, P.; Starbuck, J.; Laffan, A.; Parslow, R.; Linney, C.; Leveret, J.; Crawley, E.",,315,16

We state that in most cases modern recipients do not check the information obtained from media sources (as confirmation, we present the results of an electronic survey). Nowadays most respondents do not pay attention to the information provided and are ready to repost the material on their social media pages. The data obtained confirm this thesis: 45.8 % partially 23.7 % fully do not check the information from media sources, therefore, almost two thirds of respondents trust the facts presented in media. We associate low media literacy with the rapid globalization of modern media, due to which the flow of information is uncontrolled, especially in Internet communication. Another reason for low media literacy is the ""skill"" of journalists to mislead recipients through bright headlines. It is proved that a bright headline, compositionally organized as an interrogative or exclamatory sentence, has a greater impact than a narrative construction. According to our survey, headlines with lexical manipulative resources are the most popular (44 %), while headlines with phonetic manipulative means are less affected by the recipient. Most of the interviewed recipients are still ready to check the factuality of the information in a media text (we emphasize that we have deliberately selected fake news). Some recipients (22 %) pay attention to fake news because of a bright headline (or trusting a verified media resource) and are ready to repost the news without verification. Due to the resonance of the news related to COVID-19 journalists have used not only objective but also fake news as a tool to influence the recipient. The questionnaire clearly indicates that media literacy of modern recipients is influenced by the political orientation of a media source, as well as the recklessness of recipients to verify the facts and trust any information obtained from official sources and interpreted in media.

We formalize the issues mathematically with an example problem of a buyer deciding whether or not to open a restaurant by purchasing location data to determine if the potential number of customers is sufficient to open. The problem is expressed as a sequential decision making problem, where the buyer first makes a series of decisions about which data to buy and concludes with a decision about opening the restaurant or not.

Cellular modules are key units of adaptive evolution because organismal fitness depends on their performance. Theory shows that in rapidly evolving populations, such as those of many microbes, adaptation is driven primarily by common beneficial mutations with large effects, while other mutations behave as if they are effectively neutral. As a consequence, if a module can be improved only by rare and/or weak beneficial mutations, its adaptive evolution would stall. However, such evolutionary stalling has not been empirically demonstrated, and it is unclear to what extent stalling may limit the power of natural selection to improve modules. Here, we empirically characterize how natural selection improves the translation machinery (TM), an essential cellular module. We experimentally evolved populations of Escherichia coli with genetically perturbed TMs for 1,000 generations. Populations with severe TM defects initially adapted via mutations in the TM, but TM adaptation stalled within about 300 generations. We estimate that the genetic load in our populations incurred by residual TM defects ranges from 0.5 to 19%. Finally, we found evidence that both epistasis and the depletion of the pool of beneficial mutations contributed to evolutionary stalling. Our results suggest that cellular modules may not be fully optimized by natural selection despite the availability of adaptive mutations.","Venkataram, Sandeep; Monasky, Ross; Sikaroodi, Shohreh H; Kryazhimskiy, Sergey; Kaçar, Betül",bioRxiv,315,1

Preliminary studies suggest that some species alter neuronal number to scale with changes in body size. Similarly, in some species regenerates resulting from wholebody axis regeneration are smaller than their pre-amputated parent, but they maintain the correct proportionality, suggesting that tissue and neuronal scaling also occurs in regenerates. The cell dynamics and responses of neuronal subtypes during nervous system regeneration, scaling, and whole-body axis regeneration are not well understood in any system. The cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is capable of wholebody axis regeneration, and its transparent, “simple” body plan and the availability of fluorescent reporter transgenic lines allow neuronal subtypes to be tracked in vivo in adult and regenerating animals. A number of observations suggest this anemone is able to alter its size in responses to changes in feeding. We utilized the NvLWamide-like::mCherry neuronal subtype transgenic reporter line to determine the in vivo response of neuronal subtypes during growth, degrowth, and regeneration. Results Nematostella alters its size in response to caloric intake, and the nervous system responds by altering neuronal number to scale as the animal changes in size. Neuronal numbers in both the endodermal and ectodermal nerve nets decreased as animals shrunk, increased as they grew, and the changes were reversible. Whole-body axis regeneration resulted in regenerates that were smaller than their pre-amputated size, and the regenerated nerve nets were reduced in neuronal number. Different neuronal subtypes had several distinct responses during regeneration that included consistent, no, and conditional increases in number. Conditional responses were regulated, in part, by the size of the remnant fragment and the position of the amputation site. Regenerates and adults with reduced nerve nets displayed normal behaviors, indicating that the nerve net retains functionality as it scales. Conclusion These data suggest that the Nematostella nerve net is dynamic, capable of scaling with changes in body size, and that neuronal subtypes display differential regenerative responses, which we propose may be linked to the scale state of the regenerating animals.","Havrilak, Jamie A.; Al-Shaer, Layla; Baban, Noor; Akinci, Nesli; Layden, Michael J.",bioRxiv,315,1

Objectives: To analyze positivity rate to SARS-COV2 antibody tests (SC2AT) in patients diagnosed of rheumatic diseases (RMD) treated with Rituximab. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of patients diagnosed of RMD followed in a referral hospital in Madrid, Spain. Positivity rate to IgG-SC2AT were analyzed in Rituximab-treated patients (RTX) compared with patients treated with TNF inhibitors (TNFi) and/or conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) (N-RTX). We included patients that received Rituximab in the previous year to a confirmed SARS-COV2 infection (defined as a positive polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) and/or compatible chest Xray), to a suspected SARS-COV2 infection (2 or more symptoms) or to SC2AT determination. Patients with RMD treated with other biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) rather than Rituximab or TNFi were excluded. Results: We included 152 patients with RMD who underwent a SC2AT. Main characteristics are reported in Table 1. Among RTX and N-RTX, 4/48 (8.3%) and 35/104 (33.7%) showed a positive IgG-SC2AT, respectively. Four out of 104 (38.5%) N-RTX tested positive without previous symptoms. No asymptomatic infection was diagnosed among RTX.

This correlated with an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes (especially tissue resident CD8+ T cells), lactate dehydrogenase and albumin (biomarkers of cell death and barrier integrity). Follow-up of a subset of these patients greater than 1-year post-COVID19 indicated these abnormalities resolved over time. Collectively, these data indicate that COVID-19 results in a prolonged change to the airway immune landscape in those with persistent lung disease, with evidence of cell death and tissue repair linked to ongoing activation of cytotoxic T cells.","Vijayakumar, B.; Boustani, K.; Ogger, P.

It provides continuous, person-centered, relationship-based care that considers the needs and preferences of individuals, families, and communities. Without access to high-quality primary care, minor health problems can spiral into chronic disease, chronic disease management becomes difficult and uncoordinated, visits to emergency departments increase, preventive care lags, and health care spending soars to unsustainable levels. Unequal access to primary care remains a concern, and the COVID-19 pandemic amplified pervasive economic, mental health, and social health disparities that ubiquitous, high-quality primary care might have reduced. Primary care is the only health care component where an increased supply is associated with better population health and more equitable outcomes. For this reason, primary care is a common good, which makes the strength and quality of the country's primary care services a public concern.

Although publications on overtourism have grown exponentially in recent years, its scientific study still has major shortcomings, particularly with regard to measurement. With the aim of overcoming this insufficiency, we have carried out a review of the literature (using the mapping review method) and, based on its conclusions, we have drawn up a proposal to systematise the measurement of overtourism by combining several tools: indicators, surveys, interviews, and other tools linked to the Internet and social networks. The results of the research make a contribution to the expansion of the literature on the topic and may have important practical implications in formulating effective land-use policies by guiding policy makers in the management of overtourism. They could be of use in both the early detection of overtourism and the design of policies that prevent and/or detect situations of risk and that correct existing problems.

The mechanism research based on network pharmacology,15.169347,6.4986453,2020,"The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has led to a massive collapse in economic activity and energy demand, with the result of significant emissions reductions at a global scale. However, the existing literature investigating abatement from COVID-19 mainly overlooked the overwhelming emissions reduction in Europe's power sector. We address this by assessing the intricate relationship between electricity demand shocks and heterogeneous generation technologies in the power sectors of 16 major European economies during January to March 2020. We apply an econometric model in an instrumental-variables framework. In a first step, we assess the impact of COVID-19 infections on electricity demand, and in a second step how this translates into emissions abatement. We find that, during full lockdown, COVID-19 reduced electricity demand by 19% and carbon emissions by an astonishing 34% per hour, whereas there is severe country heterogeneity depending on the electricity supply structure and demand shock intensity. From our estimates, we predict that power sector emissions fell by 18.4% in 2020. Our results reveal the importance of a carbon price, so that a demand reduction can offset large amounts of emissions by displacing coal at the margin. We derive several policy implications from our analysis to draw lessons from the pandemic. © 2021","Haxhimusa, A.; Liebensteiner, M.",Energy Policy,315,1

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the capacity of synthetic compounds to inhibit the Candida glabrata enzyme denominated 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (CgHMGR), and thus affect ergosterol synthesis and yeast viability. One series of synthetic antifungal compounds were analogues to fibrates, a second series had substituted 1,2-dihydroquinolines and the third series included substituted pyrroles. α-asarone-related compounds 1c and 5b with a pyrrolic core were selected as the best antifungal candidates. Both inhibited the growth of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata 43 and fluconazole-susceptible C. glabrata CBS 138. A yeast growth rescue experiment based on the addition of exogenous ergosterol showed that the compounds act by inhibiting the mevalonate synthesis pathway. A greater recovery of yeast growth occurred for the C. glabrata 43 strain and after the 1c (versus 5b) treatment. Given that the compounds decreased the ergosterol concentration in the yeast strains, they probably target the ergosterol synthesis. According to the docking analysis, the inhibitory effect of the 1c and 5b could possibly be mediated by their interaction with the amino acid residues of the catalytic site of CgHMGR. Since 1c displayed higher binding energy than α-asarone and 5b, it is a good candidate for further research, which should include structural modifications to increase its specificity and potency as well as in vivo studies on its effectiveness at a therapeutic dose. HIGHLIGHTS Fibrate-based and pyrrole-containing compounds were tested as C. glabrata inhibitors. The best inhibitor from fibrate was 1c and from pyrroles was 5b. These agents inhibited C. glabrata growth better than the reference antifungals. They also inhibited ergosterol synthesis by the two C. glabrata strains tested.

However, it remains largely unknown whether infected children develop cellular immune memory. Methods: To determine whether a memory T cell response is being developed as an indicator for long-term immune protection, we performed a longitudinal assessment of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response by IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT and activation marker expression analyses of peripheral blood samples from children and adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Results: Upon stimulation of PBMCs with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or overlapping peptides of spike (S-SARS-CoV-2) and nucleocapsid proteins, we found S-SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-{gamma} T cell responses in most infected children (83%) and all adults (100%) that were absent in unexposed controls. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in infected adults, especially in those with moderate symptoms, compared to infected children. The S-SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} T cell response correlated with S1-SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody concentrations. Predominantly, effector memory CD4+ T cells of a Th1 phenotype were activated upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which persisted for 4-8 weeks after symptom onset. We detected very low frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells in these individuals. Conclusions: Our data indicate that an antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cell response is induced in children and adults with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities and to assess risk factors and correlations with major European peaks in incidence of key VPDs over time. Methods We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health January 2000 to October 2019) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on VPD outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, N meningitidis, and H influenzae) in migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Results 45 studies were included, reporting on 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 countries (26 [55%] were reported between 2010 and 2020, including 16 [34%] since 2015). Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6578 total cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 596 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1510 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n=2; 295 cases). 19 (40%) of outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary camps or shelters for asylum seekers and refugees. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, 82% were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=12) were associated with migrants from Eastern European countries, often involving migrants of Roma ethnicity. Conclusions Migrants represent one of several under-immunised groups involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees and asylum seekers residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and individual demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies for implementing catch-up vaccination to specific groups, alongside the strengthening of routine data collection, in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets. Better understanding vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups, and reducing the barriers they face to accessing vaccination services, is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery at the current time. Strengthening vaccine delivery to migrant populations will require a greater focus on co-designing vaccine uptake strategies in close collaboration with affected communities.

Aim: To describe indirect impact on the number of hospitalized children with COVID-19 in the first three months after beginning of emergency use of two vaccines. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted in two pediatric hospitals of Rio de Janeiro city, between January and April 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Number of cases, clinical signs, symptoms and outcomes were compared with the first wave of disease (April- June 2020). A p value of less than .05 were considered was significant. Results: The number of total admitted patients (with all diseases) were 1097 in 2020 period, being 46 (4.2%) of them with confirmed COVID-19, and 2187 in the 2021 period, with 47 (2.1%) cases (p=0.006). Predominant respiratory symptoms were present in 29/46 (63%) as the main presentation in 2020 patients and 37/47 (78.7%) in 2021 children (p=0.09). The main symptoms were fever, cough and dyspnoea in both periods. The median of lenght of stay after diagnosis were 4 days in 2020 and 2021 ( p=0.9). Just one patient died in 2021. Conclusion: There was reduction of relative percentage of admitted confirmed pediatric cases in the the first three months of emergency use of two vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but it is uncertain to atribute this finding to vaccination due to high circulation of the virus in the city.","Fonseca, C.

However, the safety of the third (booster) dose has not been fully established yet. Objective: Evaluate the short-term, self-reported and physiological reactions to the third BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (booster) vaccine dose. Design: A prospective observational study, in which participants are equipped with a smartwatch and fill in a daily questionnaire via a dedicated mobile application for a period of 21 days, starting seven days before the vaccination. Setting: An Israel-wide third (booster) vaccination campaign. Participants: A group of 1503 (18+ years of age) recipients of at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 20, 2020, and September 6, 2021, out of a larger cohort of 2,848 prospective study participants. 1,231 of the participants were recipients of the third vaccine dose. Measurements: Daily self-reported questionnaires regarding local and systemic reactions, mood level, stress level, sport duration, and sleep quality. Heart rate and heart rate variability were continuously measured by Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatches. Results: Local and systemic reactions reported following the third (booster) dose administration are similar to those reported following the second dose and considerably greater than those reported following the first dose. Our analyses of self-reported well-being indicators as well as the objective heart rate and heart rate variability measures recorded by the smartwatches further support this finding. These measures returned to their baseline levels within three days from inoculation with the third dose. These trends were consistent regardless of age, gender or the existence of an underlying medical condition. Limitations: Participants may not adequately represent the vaccinated population in Israel and elsewhere. Conclusion: Our work further supports the safety of a third COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA (booster) vaccine dose from both a subjective and an objective perspective.

Hawai'i has not been spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from 2 patients from Hawai'i who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the 2 viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawai'i from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with 1 non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the 2 Hawai'i strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain.

The complete genome of the SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) protein shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. In the present paper, we show that SARS-CoV N is capable of inducing apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by down-regulating ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), up-regulating JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways, and affecting their downstream effectors. SARS-CoV N expression also down-regulated phospho-Akt and Bcl-2 levels, and activated caspases 3 and 7. However, apoptosis was independent of the p53 and Fas signalling pathways. Furthermore, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway was found to induce actin reorganization in cells devoid of growth factors. At the cytoskeletal level, SARS-CoV N down-regulated FAK (focal adhesion kinase) activity and also down-regulated fibronectin expression. This is the first report showing the ability of the N protein of SARS-CoV to induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stressed conditions.","Surjit, Milan; Liu, Boping; Jameel, Shahid; Chow, Vincent T K; Lal, Sunil K",The Biochemical journal,315,31

The objective of this single-center, randomized, controlled trial was to investigate the relationship between VAP and various methods of oral health care. All patients included in the study (n=142) were on mechanical ventilation with oral intubation at the intensive care unit of the Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital. They were divided into two groups, one receiving standard oral health care (Standard group), and the other receiving oral health care using an oral moisture gel instead of water (Gel group). After removal of the intubation tube, biofilm on cuff of the tube was stained with a disclosing agent to determine the contamination level. Factors investigated included sex, age, number of remaining teeth, intubation time, fever ≥38.5°C, VAP, cuff contamination level, and time required for one oral health care session. No VAP occurred in either group during the study period. The level of cuff contamination was significantly lower in the Gel group than the Standard group, and the time required for one session of oral health care was shorter (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed use of the oral moisture gel as a factor affecting cuff contamination level. Use of an oral moisture gel decreased invasion of the pharynx by bacteria and contaminants together with biofilm formation on the intubation tube cuff. These results suggest that oral health care using an oral moisture gel is effective in preventing cuff contamination.","Takeyasu, Yoshihiro; Yamane, Gen-Yuki; Tonogi, Morio; Watanabe, Yutaka; Nishikubo, Shuichi; Serita, Ryohei; Imura, Kumiko",The Bulletin of Tokyo Dental College,315,9

Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes. Here, we determined the sequence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), isolate Frankfurt 1, and characterized key RNA elements and protein functions involved in viral genome expression. Important regulatory mechanisms, such as the (discontinuous) synthesis of eight subgenomic mRNAs, ribosomal frameshifting and post-translational proteolytic processing, were addressed. Activities of three SARS coronavirus enzymes, the helicase and two cysteine proteinases, which are known to be critically involved in replication, transcription and/or post-translational polyprotein processing, were characterized. The availability of recombinant forms of key replicative enzymes of SARS coronavirus should pave the way for high-throughput screening approaches to identify candidate inhibitors in compound libraries.","Thiel, Volker; Ivanov, Konstantin A; Putics, Akos; Hertzig, Tobias; Schelle, Barbara; Bayer, Sonja; Weissbrich, Benedikt; Snijder, Eric J; Rabenau, Holger; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John",The Journal of general virology,315,8

As a result, each virus-specific mRNA contains an identical leader RNA derived from the 5', end of the genomic RNA. In this study, we demonstrate by primer extension studies that the leader-fusion sites on a given species of coronavirus subgenomic mRNA are heterogeneous. The heterogeneity was due to variation in the number of pentanucleotide (UCUAA) repeats present at the leader fusion site. This pentanucleotide repeat region was complementary between the free leader RNA and the transcription start sites on the template RNA. This result suggests that the discontinuous transcription of coronavirus mRNAs occurs within the complementary sequences localized in two different RNA segments and that RNA joining occurs at variable sites.","Makino, S; Soe, L H; Shieh, C K; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,315,9

Apoptosis is coordinated by a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases, that are activated during apoptosis and participate in dismantling the cell by cleaving key structural and regulatory proteins. We have explored the caspase activation events that are initiated upon infection of the human rectal tumor cell line HRT18 with TGEV. We show that TGEV infection results in the activation of caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 and cleavage of the caspase substrates eIF4GI, gelsolin, and alpha-fodrin. Surprisingly, the TGEV nucleoprotein (N) underwent proteolysis in parallel with the activation of caspases within the host cell. Cleavage of the N protein was inhibited by cell-permeative caspase inhibitors, suggesting that this viral structural protein is a target for host cell caspases. We show that the TGEV nucleoprotein is a substrate for both caspase-6 and -7, and using site-directed mutagenesis, we have mapped the cleavage site to VVPD(359) downward arrow.

Turkeys inoculated with only R98/5 did not develop clinically apparent disease, and only mild disease and moderate growth depression were observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV. Turkeys dually inoculated with TCV and R98/5 developed severe enteritis with high mortality (38/48, 79%) and marked growth depression. R98/5 infection resulted in attaching/effacing (AE) intestinal lesions characteristic of EPEC: adherence of bacterial microcolonies to intestinal epithelium with degeneration and necrosis of epithelium at sites of bacterial attachment. AE lesions were more extensive and were detected for a prolonged duration in dually inoculated turkeys compared with turkeys inoculated with only R98/5. An apparent synergistic effect in dually inoculated turkeys was indicated by increased mortality, enhanced growth depression, and enhanced AE lesion development. The results suggest that TCV promoted intestinal colonization by R98/5; however, R98/5 did not appear to alter TCV infection.

The efficiency of frameshifting was 25 to 28%, significantly greater than the 5 to 7% efficiency reported previously in a cell-free translation system. Coupling of transcription and translation in a cell-free system yielded frameshifting efficiencies threefold greater than that of the uncoupled in vitro system. The presence of the shifty heptamer was an absolute requirement for frameshifting in both cell-free and intact-cell systems, while deletion of the potential downstream pseudoknot region did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting.","Lewis, T L; Matsui, S M",Journal of virology,315,1

Human rotavirus (HRV) detection was performed by direct electron microscopy (EM), conventional immune electron microscopy (IEM) and/or solid phase immune electron microscopy ( SPIEM ); rotavirus antigens were detected by indirect double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA and HRV isolation was attempted in MA-104 or LLC-MK2 cell cultures. HRV serology was done on paired sera from all the patients by the indirect immunoperoxidase antibody (IPA) technique for HRV IgG determination, and by an indirect ELISA method using a purified HRV Wa strain as a solid phase. HRV particles were detected by EM and/or IEM in 53 cases (41.7%) and by SPIEM in 5 additional cases; HRV antigens were demonstrated by indirect DAS ELISA in the same 53 cases, whereas 40 cases (31.4%) were positive for HRV isolation in cell cultures. Sixty-four patients (50.3%) seroconverted by IPA and ELISA, including all the cases (58) positive for rotavirus detection in stools and 6 additional cases. Thus, SPIEM appears to be the most sensitive technique for detecting a few virus particles in stool specimens, but HRV serology is the most sensitive method for diagnosing HRV infections retrospectively, when paired sera are drawn at an appropriate time. However, EM possess the great advantage of detecting in fecal specimens viral agents other than rotaviruses, such as adenoviruses, enteric coronaviruses, small round viruses, astroviruses and others.","Gerna, G; Passarani, N; Cattaneo, E; Torsellini, M; Percivalle, E; Battaglia, M; Torre, D; Cereda, P M",Microbiologica,315,5

Multivariate logistic regression was performed to create predictive models for predicting MIS-C. Results Of 68 patients, 28 (41.2%) had MIS-C while 40 (58.8%) had severe/critical COVID-19 infection. MIS-C patients had a higher prevalence of fever, mucocutaneous, cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement and a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms (P<0.05). Significantly lower hemoglobin, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and significantly elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers were observed in MIS-C cohort. Upon multivariate logistic regression, the best model included C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus involvement and absence of respiratory involvement (performance of 0.94). Using sensitivity analysis, CRP>40mg/L with either platelet count<150x103/mm3 or mucocutaneous involvement had specificity of 97.5% to diagnose MIS-C.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether general immunostimulation (injections of keyhole limpet hemocyanin emulsified in incomplete Freund adjuvant and of thioglycollate medium) could strengthen the severity of PMWS in six-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) piglets transfected with pure tandem-cloned PCV2 DNA by the intramuscular route. Non-immunostimulated piglets transfected with the viral clone did not present clinical signs but only mild pathological microlesions characteristic of PMWS. These piglets seroconverted and high viral genome loads and infectious titers were detected in the lymphoid organs at the end of the trial. Mild-to-moderate forms of PMWS were generally observed in the immunostimulated transfected piglets, as well as one severe form for a piglet (8003) which died. These piglets with mild-to-moderate forms had higher DNA loads than the transfected-only animals. Thus, viral replication was enhanced by immunostimulation. This is the first time that clinical PMWS has been reported in an SPF immunostimulated piglet infected with a pure inoculum consisting of tandem-cloned PCV2 DNA.

The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was &#8805;96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","van Kasteren, Puck B; van der Veer, Bas; van den Brink, Sharon; Wijsman, Lisa; de Jonge, Jørgen; van den Brandt, Annemarie; Molenkamp, Richard; Reusken, Chantal B E M; Meijer, Adam",J Clin Virol,315,16

Several studies have already described acute limb ischemia and peripheral arterial disease in critically ill patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), as well as coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke as a manifestation usually associated with respiratory distress. However, what still remains unclear is how long inflammation and thrombotic derangements can last after recovery from the symptoms of Covid-19. Hence, in this article we report 3 cases of arterial thrombotic sequalae after this viral infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cases' series that had described different delayed vascular arterial complications, which occurred after the index infection, with a negative nasopharyngeal swab and Covid-19 systemic symptoms resumption. A better understanding of the coagulopathy in Covid-19 could have an essential role to guide prevention and treatment of arterial thromboembolic events, both during and after the viral infection. Further investigations are required to confirm these data and to estabilish the type, dose and duration of anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy not just during but also after Covid-19 infection.","Borrelli, Maria Pia; Buora, Adelaide; Scrivere, Paola; Sponza, Massimo; Frigatti, Paolo",Ann. vasc. surg,315,16

Nurse Practitioners (NPs) represent an efficient solution to human resource challenges. During the current pandemic, many Medical Directors in LTC homes worked virtually to reduce the risk of transmission. In contrast, NPs were present for in-person care. This study aims to understand the NPs' roles in optimizing resident care and supporting LTC staff during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada was recruited. Data was generated using semi-structured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four categories relating to the NPs' practices and experiences during the pandemic were identified: a) containing the spread of COVID-19; b) stepping in where needed; c) supporting staff and families; and d) establishing links between fragmented systems of care by acting as a liaison. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that innovative models of care that include NPs in LTC homes are required moving forward. NPs embraced a multitude of roles in LTC homes, but the need to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 was central to how they prioritized their days. The pandemic clearly accentuated that NPs have a unique scope of practice, which positions them well to act as leaders and build capacity in LTC home.","McGilton, Katherine S; Krassikova, Alexandra; Boscart, Veronique; Sidani, Souraya; Iaboni, Andrea; Vellani, Shirin; Escrig-Pinol, Astrid",GerontologistGerontologist,315,1

To help clinicians in the rapid triage of patients at high risk of COVID-19 while waiting for RT-PCR results, different diagnostic prediction models have been developed. Our objective is to identify, compare, and evaluate performances of prediction models for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adult patients in a health care setting. METHODS: A search for relevant references has been conducted on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Rigorous eligibility criteria have been established (e.g., adult participants, suspicion of COVID-19, medical setting) and applied by two independent investigators to identify suitable studies at 2 different stages: (1) titles and abstracts screening and (2) full-texts screening. Risk of bias (RoB) has been assessed using the Prediction model study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Data synthesis has been presented according to a narrative report of findings. RESULTS: Out of the 2334 references identified by the literature search, 13 articles have been included in our systematic review. The studies, carried out all over the world, were performed in 2020. The included articles proposed a model developed using different methods, namely, logistic regression, score, machine learning, XGBoost. All the included models performed well to discriminate adults at high risks of presenting COVID-19 (all area under the ROC curve (AUROC) > 0.500). The best AUROC was observed for the model of Kurstjens et al (AUROC = 0.940 (0.910-0.960), which was also the model that achieved the highest sensitivity (98%). RoB was evaluated as low in general. CONCLUSION: Thirteen models have been developed since the start of the pandemic in order to diagnose COVID-19 in suspected patients from health care centers. All these models are effective, to varying degrees, in identifying whether patients were at high risk of having COVID-19.","Locquet, Médéa; Diep, Anh Nguyet; Beaudart, Charlotte; Dardenne, Nadia; Brabant, Christian; Bruyère, Olivier; Donneau, Anne-Françoise",Arch Public Health,315,13

Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, and contribute symmetrically to a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and to a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","Karathanou, Konstantina; Lazaratos, Michalis; Bertalan, Éva; Siemers, Malte; Buzar, Krzysztof; Schertler, Gebhard F X; Del Val, Coral; Bondar, Ana-Nicoleta",J Struct Biol,315,10

To obtain exogenous variation in central bank policy, we rely on high-frequency surprises in financial market data for the euro area (EA) around policy announcement dates. We trace the dynamic effects of shocks to the short-term policy rate, forward guidance and quantitative easing on several key macroeconomic and financial quantities alongside survey-based measures of expectations. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian smooth-transition vector autoregression (ST-VAR). Our results suggest that transmission channels are impaired when uncertainty is elevated.

The majority of the neonates with COVID-19 reported so far are suspected to be infected due to postnatal transmission. Vertical transmission has already been reported in two case-cohort studies. Case report: A 32-week preemie with a birth weight of 2 kg was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress. The case was born to a primigravida mother with a history of preterm premature rupture of membranes. The neonate developed arterial thrombosis on the first day of life and subsequent gangrene of the right foot and tested positive for serology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, D-dimer, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase). Since the mother was asymptomatic, she was not tested for SARS-CoV-2 antenatally. After the confirmation in the neonate, the mother was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 and tested positive by RT-PCR as well as serology. Conclusion: This rare presentation calls for further research in transmission patterns either antenatally or vertical transmission. This report emphasized the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 in neonates from asymptomatic mothers, with significant, early-onset neonatal infection in the form of thrombosis.","Skalyanshettar, S.; Charki, S.",Iranian Journal of Neonatology,315,1

Many patients are attempting to balance health and financial stability. Therefore, we sought to determine how physicians who frequently prescribe immunosuppressive medications are counselling patients on return-to-work prior to widespread vaccine distribution and understand their decision processes. Methods We administered a survey through the Canadian Rheumatology, Gastroenterology and Dermatology Associations. Physicians were asked whether patients have requested counselling on return-to-work during the pandemic and how they decide what advice to provide. They were shown seven clinical scenarios of patients on immunosuppressive medications, then asked whether they would provide a medical note advocating for delayed return-to-work or modified duties to reduce exposure. Results 151 physicians took the survey. 94% were asked for advice on return-to-work. 33% felt informed enough to provide counselling. When patients requested a medical note, physicians provided one 25% of the time. Factors most associated with providing notes were patient comorbidities, age, glucocorticoids, high risk work and vulnerable co-inhabitants. Conventional synthetic and biologic immunosuppressants did not prompt most physicians to provide a note. Respondents considered patient perspectives and workplace factors. Several requested guidelines to approach these encounters. Conclusion Almost all rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists have been asked to counsel patients on returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most do not feel informed enough to do so. Medical notes for acconunodations are only provided a minority of the time, unless specific factors (e.g. glucocorticoids) are present. Guidance is needed to inform these decisions.","Ladak, K.; Winthrop, K.; Marshall, J. K.; Gelfand, J.; Pope, J.",Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology,315,20

Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil (B.1.1.28-E484K) have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless, the spread of B.1.1.28 (E484K) and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28 (E484K) lineage, demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28 (E484K) with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also, clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state (named VUI-NP13L) characterized by 12 lineage-defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion, co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13 L in Rio Grande do Sul, we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Francisco, Ronaldo da Silva; Benites, L Felipe; Lamarca, Alessandra P; de Almeida, Luiz G P; Hansen, Alana Witt; Gularte, Juliana Schons; Demoliner, Meriane; Gerber, Alexandra L; de C Guimarães, Ana Paula; Antunes, Ana Karolina Eisen; Heldt, Fagner Henrique; Mallmann, Larissa; Hermann, Bruna; Ziulkoski, Ana Luiza; Goes, Vyctoria; Schallenberger, Karoline; Fillipi, Micheli; Pereira, Francini; Weber, Matheus Nunes; de Almeida, Paula Rodrigues; Fleck, Juliane Deise; Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza R; Spilki, Fernando Rosado",Virus Res,315,1

Both SARS coronavirus genomes encode two overlapping large polyproteins, which are cleaved at specific sites by a 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) in a post-translational processing step that is critical for coronavirus replication. The 3CLpro sequences for CoV-1 and CoV-2 viruses are 100% identical in the catalytic domain that carries out protein cleavage. A research effort that focused on the discovery of reversible and irreversible ketone-based inhibitors of SARS CoV-1 3CLpro employing ligand-protease structures solved by X-ray crystallography led to the identification of 3 and 4.

Following this declaration, country progress on operationalization of the PHC agenda and attainment of UHC has been stalled by the new challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also disrupted the continuity of essential health service provision and tested the resilience of the region's health systems. METHODS: In accordance with this, the WHO Regional Office for Africa convened the Fifth Health Sector Directors' Planning and Policy Meeting across the 47 Member States of the Region. The two-day forum focused on building health system resilience to facilitate service continuity during health threats, PHC revitalization, and health systems strengthening towards UHC. RESULTS: The Regional Forum provided evidence on building resilient health systems in the WHO African Region and engaged participants in meaningful and critical discussion. It is from these discussions that four key themes emerged: (1) working multisectorally/intersectorally, (2) moving from fragmentation to integration, (3) ensuring implementation and knowledge exchange, and (4) rethinking resilience and embracing antifragility. These discussions and associated groupings by thematic areas lend themselves to recommendations for the WHO. CONCLUSIONS: This paper details the proceedings and key findings on building resilient health systems, the four themes that emerged from participant deliberation, and the recommendations that have emerged from the meeting. Deliberations from the Regional Forum are critical, as they have the potential to directly inform policy and program design, given that the meeting convenes health sector technocrats, who are at the helm of policy design, action, and implementation.","Tumusiime, Prosper; Karamagi, Humphrey; Titi-Ofei, Regina; Amri, Michelle; Seydi, Aminata Binetou Wahebine; Kipruto, Hillary; Droti, Benson; Zombre, Sosthene; Yoti, Zabulon; Zawaira, Felicitas; Cabore, Joseph",BMC Proc,315,33

METHODS: Single-cell transcriptomic datasets of the early TE as well as the first- and second-trimester placentas have been reported1,2 . Here, we conducted the transcriptomic analysis of 4198 early TE cells, 1260 first-trimester placental cells and 189 EVTs at 24-week placentas (EVT_24W) by SMART-Seq2 method. Immunohistochemical staining of the human first-, second- and third- trimester placentas was performed to confirm bioinformatic results. RESULTS: Via bioinformatic analysis, we identified the existence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in human TE as well as in the first- and second- trimester placentas. In human TE data, 54.4% of TE1 cells, 9.0% of CTBs, 3.2% of EVTs and 29.5% of STBs were ACE2 positive. As for TMPRSS2, 90.7% of TE1 cells, 31.5% of CTBs, 22.1% of EVTs and 70.8% of STBs were TMPRSS2 positive. Amongst the placental cells, 20.4% of CTBs, 44.1% of STBs, 3.4% of EVT_8W and 63% of EVT_24W were ACE2 positive. And 1.6% of CTBs, 26.5% of STBs, 1.9% of EVT_8W and 20.1% of EVT_24W were TMPRSS2 positive. Pathway analysis revealed associations to morphogenesis of branching structure, extracellular matrix interaction, oxygen binding and antioxidant activity in ACE2+TMPRSS2+ EVT_24W cells. The ACE2+TMPRSS2+ TE1 cells were correlated with an increased capacity of viral invasion, epithelial cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Based on immunohistochemical results, expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in first- and second- and third-trimester placentas was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells in the human TE and placentas at different stages of pregnancy, which indicates the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 could spread via the placenta and cause intrauterine fetal infection.

Seroprevalence surveys are an important tool to identify not just cases that have come to clinical attention, but all previously infected recipients. We performed a seroprevalence survey of the adult heart transplant program at a large New York City Hospital System. A total of 232 (87% of recipients being followed) subjects were tested, of whom 37 (15.9%) were found to be previously infected. This is comparable to the overall rate of prior infection in the NYC metro area. Disease course tended to be more severe than in the general population; however, this was at least partially driven by traditional risk factors of age and comorbidities. Lastly, 9 of 10 recipients who were initially found to be PCR positive subsequently tested positive for antibodies, confirming the ability of this population to mount a humoral response. In conclusion, prevalence of COVID-19 in heart transplant recipients on immunosuppression was comparable to that in the general population of NYC, and 90% of those with an initially positive viral swab developed antibodies. In those who are infected, disease course tends to be more severe.","Patel, Snehal R; Gjelaj, Christiana; Fletcher, Rena; Luke, Anne; Paschenko, Alexandra; Farooq, Muhammad; Saeed, Omar; Vukelic, Sasa; Jorde, Ulrich P",Clin Transplant,315,26

Whether rich or poor, all nations are struggling to cope with this new global health crisis. The speed of the threat's emergence and the quick response required from public health authorities and the public itself makes evident the need for a major reform in pandemic surveillance and notification systems. The development and implementation of a graded, individual-level pandemic notification system could be an effective tool to combat future threats of epidemics. This paper describes a prototype model of such a notification system and its potential advantages and challenges for implementation. Similar to other emergency alerts, this system would include a number of threat levels (level 1-5) with a higher level indicating increasing severity and intensity of safety measures (eg, level 1: general hygiene, level 2: enhanced hygiene, level 3: physical distancing, level 4: shelter in place, and level 5: lockdown). The notifications would be transmitted to cellular devices via text message (for lower threat levels) or push notification (for higher threat levels). The notification system would allow the public to be informed about the threat level in real time and act accordingly in an organized manner. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently launched similar alert systems designed to coordinate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response more efficiently. Implementing such a system, however, faces multiple challenges. Extensive preparation and coordination among all levels of government and relevant sectors are required. Additionally, such systems may be effective primarily in countries where there exists at least moderate trust in government. Advance and ongoing public education about the nature of the system and its steps would be an essential part of the system, such that all members of the public understand the meaning of each step in advance, similar to what has been established in systems for other emergency responses. This educational component is of utmost importance to minimize adverse public reaction and unintended consequences. The use of mass media and local communities could be considered where mobile phone penetration is low. The implementation of such a notification system would be more challenging in developing countries for several reasons, including inadequate technology, limited use of data plans, high population density, poverty, mistrust in government, and tendency to ignore or failure to understand the warning messages. Despite the challenges, an individual-level pandemic notification system could provide added benefits by giving an additional route for notification that would be complementary to existing platforms.","Sakib, Mohammad Nazmus; Butt, Zahid A; Morita, Plinio Pelegrini; Oremus, Mark; Fong, Geoffrey T; Hall, Peter A",J Med Internet Res,315,21

COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are often critically ill and show lung injury and hemolysis. Heme is a prosthetic moiety crucial for the function of a wide variety of heme-proteins, including hemoglobin and cytochromes. However, injury-derived free heme promotes adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte recruitment, vascular permeabilization, platelet activation, complement activation, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Heme can be degraded by the anti-inflammatory enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) generating biliverdin/bilirubin, iron/ferritin, and carbon monoxide. We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, whilst induction of HO-1 or harnessing heme may provide protection. HO-activity not only degrades injurious heme, but its effector molecules possess also potent salutary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Until a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, we need to explore novel strategies to attenuate the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 leading to morbidity and mortality. The heme-HO system represents an interesting target for novel “proof of concept” studies in the context of COVID-19.","Wagener, Frank A. D. T.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodologic quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalence of chest CT imaging findings were calculated with the use of a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2 &#8805;50); otherwise, a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. The median number of patients with COVID-19 per study was 124 (range, 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range, >76.3%-100%). Twenty-seven of the studies (96%) had a retrospective design. Methodologic quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (eight studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT imaging findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT imaging findings ranged between 10.5% and 63.2%. INTERPRETATION: Studies on chest CT imaging findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT imaging findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT imaging findings do not exclude COVID-19, not even in symptomatic patients.","Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C; Yakar, Derya; Hope, Michael D; Kwee, Robert M",Chest,315,3

The crisis also threw into sharp relief the fact that police policy and, crucially, practice are always implemented within wider social, political and economic contexts. Using online survey data collected from 325 police officers based at forces operating across different UK contexts (cities, conurbations, towns and rural areas), we seek to understand officer experiences and perceptions of policing COVID-19. In particular, we examine whether (internally) organisational climate and (externally) the UK government’s response to COVID-19 were important to (a) officers’ support for police use of force at times of emergency, (b) officer’s support for procedurally just policing at times of emergency, and (c) their health and well-being;and whether identification and perceptions of self-legitimacy mediate the associations between these variables. We show that a positive organisational climate was associated with &lt;italic&gt;less&lt;/italic&gt; support for police use of force, &lt;italic&gt;more&lt;/italic&gt; support for procedurally just policing and &lt;italic&gt;increased&lt;/italic&gt; police officer health and well-being. Our results, however, suggest potential negative correlates of police officer self-legitimacy: higher levels of self-legitimacy were associated with &lt;italic&gt;poorer&lt;/italic&gt; police officer health and well-being and &lt;italic&gt;increased&lt;/italic&gt; support for police use of force. These results have important implications for our understanding of police officer well-being and police officers’ commitment to democratic modes of policing when faced with policing a pandemic.

Recent clinical successes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in therapy for viral infections demonstrate that mAbs offer a solution for these emerging biothreats. We have explored this with respect to Junin virus (JUNV), an arenavirus classified as a category A high-priority agent and the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs available for preventing or treating AHF, although immune plasma from convalescent patients is used routinely to treat active infections. However, immune plasma is severely limited in quantity, highly variable in quality, and poses significant safety risks including the transmission of transfusion-borne diseases. mAbs offer a highly specific and consistently potent alternative to immune plasma that can be manufactured at large scale. We previously described a chimeric mAb, cJ199, that provided protection in a guinea pig model of AHF. To adapt this mAb to a format more suitable for clinical use, we humanized the mAb (hu199) and evaluated it in a cynomolgus monkey model of AHF with two JUNV isolates, Romero and Espindola. While untreated control animals experienced 100% lethality, all animals treated with hu199 at 6 d postinoculation (dpi) survived, and 50% of animals treated at 8 dpi survived. mAbs like hu199 may offer a safer, scalable, and more reproducible alternative to immune plasma for rare viral diseases that have epidemic potential.","Zeitlin, Larry; Cross, Robert W; Geisbert, Joan B; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Agans, Krystle N; Prasad, Abhishek N; Enterlein, Sven; Aman, M Javad; Bornholdt, Zachary A; Brennan, Miles B; Campbell, Lioudmila; Kim, Do; Mlakar, Neil; Moyer, Crystal L; Pauly, Michael H; Shestowsky, William; Whaley, Kevin J; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Proc.

We developed a protocol, C-I-TASSER, to integrate interresidue contact maps from deep neural-network learning with the cutting-edge I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Large-scale benchmark tests showed that C-I-TASSER can fold more than twice the number of non-homologous proteins than the I-TASSER, which does not use contacts. When applied to a folding experiment on 8,266 unsolved Pfam families, C-I-TASSER successfully folded 4,162 domain families, including 504 folds that are not found in the PDB. Furthermore, it created correct folds for 85% of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, despite the quick mutation rate of the virus and sparse sequence profiles. The results demonstrated the critical importance of coupling whole-genome and metagenome-based evolutionary information with optimal structure assembly simulations for solving the problem of non-homologous protein structure prediction.","Zheng, Wei Zhang Chengxin Li Yang Pearce Robin Bell Eric W.; Zhang, Yang",Cell Reports Methods,315,16

Diante destas experiências surgiu a necessidade de levantar os fatores facilitadores e dificultadores para formar e inserir enfermeiras obstétricas na prática da assistência ao parto, e como formar profissionais para enfrentar a situação de assistência vigente. Foram entrevistadas profissionais que participam da Associação Brasileira de Obstetrizes e Enfermeiros Obstetras (ABENFO), da elaboração de políticas de saúde no Ministério da Saúde e que atuaram na área como coordenadoras e docentes de cursos de especialização em enfermagem obstétrica. Para subsidiar o trabalho, foi feito uma revisão de literatura sobre as políticas de saúde da mulher, um breve levantamento da história da assistência ao parto e sobre o ensino da enfermagem no Brasil. A seguir, realizou-se 11 entrevistas com profissionais, utilizando-se a História Oral. Este método de investigação possibilita compreender como os indivíduos experimentam e interpretam os acontecimentos, e mostra a percepção do passado como algo que tem continuidade no presente. Após a transcrição, textualização e transcriação dos discursos, foram criadas 4 categorias: Atores e a história, em que as entrevistadas falam da sua trajetória profissional e da história da enfermagem obstétrica; Coadjuvantes das mudanças no contexto do ensino e da prática, onde foram levantados os fatores que contribuíram para a formação e inserção das profissionais na assistência; Barreiras para a formação profissional e para a prática da assistência, em que as entrevistadas mostram alguns dificultadores para a formação e inserção das profissionais e,Desafios na qual foram sintetizados os caminhos que as profissionais devem percorrer para implementar a formação e inserção das profissionais na assistência. Conclui-se que a trajetória percorrida foi importante para a continuidade da formação e da atuação das profissionais e que as políticas ministeriais (portarias e financiamento de cursos) contribuíram para impulsionar a profissão: que tem-se que buscar parcerias com outras categorias profissionais, em especial a médica, com instituições e gestores, e fortalecer os órgãos de classe. Tem-se ainda que titular com qualidade um número maior de profissionais, para que juntas, tenham mais condições de lutar pelas causas da profissão e por mudanças no modelo de assistência. Percebe-se que nos últimos 20 anos a profissão cresceu e foi valorizada, porém, ainda há muito o que conquistar.","Amorim, Torcata",,315,32

To support the enduring research on the improvement of COVID-19 therapeutics, herein, we demonstrated the development of highly effective and eco-friendly synthetic routes for the synthesis of dimeric 2,4-diacetyl phloroglucinol 4a, a potent antibiotic and malarial drug candidate via phenol-aldehyde condensation over silica sulphuric acid (SSA) catalyst and the arylation of dimethylammonium salts under greener protocols, i.e., ultrasound-assisted (US) and liquid assisted grinding (LAG) methods. Through an environmental assessment, the cleanness and environmental efficiency of the developed protocols were evidenced to be improved compared with a recently published alternative synthetic pathway, which was indicated by the presence of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact. In addition, we accomplished molecular docking studies to permit the rapid screening of possible therapeutic ligands of 4a and its derivatives along with N3, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir as references against the crystal structure for the recently released 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. Exclusively, our finding showed that compound 4d with an excellent binding affinity of -8.1 kcal occupies the active site in varying ways at the N3 binding site of 3CL(pro), confirming its fitness as a good candidate for the therapeutic action against COVID-19. Furthermore, molecular target prediction, pharmacokinetic studies, prediction of the activity spectra for substances (PASS), density-functional theory (DFT), and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis were also established to highlight the prominence of this chemical scaffold.","Kusumaningsih, T.; Prasetyo, W.

While several studies suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role, the key mediators of this process are yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that plasma from a high proportion (93%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not healthy controls, contains broadly auto-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM), and less frequently auto-reactive IgG or IgA. Importantly, these auto-IgM preferentially recognize primary human lung cells in vitro, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, analytical proteome microarray technology, and LDH-release cytotoxicity assays, we identify high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 260 candidate auto-antigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on the cellular membranes of pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues. These findings suggest that broad IgM-mediated autoimmune reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, thereby identifying a potential target for therapeutic interventions.","Ho Wong, Andrew Kam; Woodhouse, Isaac; Schneider, Frank; Kulpa, Deanna A; Silvestri, Guido; Maier, Cheryl L",Cell Rep Med,315,6

A secondary aim is to investigate the filter life time in Continuous VenoVenous Hemofiltration (CVVH) and the effect of different methods of anticoagulation. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the ICU between March 16th 2020 to May 10th 2020 were retrospectively studied. Patients were categorized in a AKI-group and a non-AKI-group. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. Twenty-two (60%) patients developed AKI. Mortality in the AKI-group was 41% compared to 20% in the non-AKI group, p = 0.275. Comparable mortality was seen in the RRT (39%) and the non-RRT group (44%), p = 1.000. Renal function recovered to a KDIGO-stage 1 in 64% of the patients with AKI when discharged from the ICU. Life time for the CVVH filters (n = 53) was 27 h (14-63)[2-78]. No difference was found with various methods of anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: The need for RRT in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was reversible in our cohort and RRT was not associated with an increased mortality compared to AKI without the need for RRT. Higher levels of anticoagulation were not associated with prolonged filter life.","Wilbers, Thom J; Koning, Mark V",J Crit Care,315,31

The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures on our hub-and-spoke network; the secondary end point was to evaluate if the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak was different in hub-and-spoke centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observational study conducted at the Stroke Units of Policlinico Gemelli, Ospedale San Filippo Neri, Ospedale di Belcolle, and Ospedale San Camillo de Lellis. We collected clinical reports of all consecutive patients admitted with diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during the phase 1 of the lockdown period (11 March 2020-4 May 2020). As controls, we used all consecutive patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke or TIA in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 156 and 142 clinical reports were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a reduction of number of thrombolysis, a reduction of the length of hospitalization, and an increase of pneumonia. Regarding performance indicators, we observed an increase in onset-to-door time and in door-to-groin time. We did not observe any statistically significant interaction between year (2019 vs 2020) and facility of admission (hub vs spoke) on all variables analyzed. DISCUSSION: Our observational study, involving hub-and-spoke stroke network of a wide regional area, indicates that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted on the acute stroke management. This impact was equally observed in hub as well as in spoke centers.","Brunetti, Valerio; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Caliandro, Pietro; Di Iorio, Riccardo; Monforte, Mauro; Morosetti, Roberta; Piano, Carla; Pilato, Fabio; Bellavia, Simone; Marotta, Jessica; Scala, Irene; Pedicelli, Alessandro; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Caricato, Anselmo; Roberti, Cinzia; Altavista, Maria Concetta; Valenza, Alessandro; Distefano, Marisa; Cecconi, Emanuela; Fanella, Martina; Roncacci, Sabina; Tasillo, Miriam; Calabresi, Paolo; Frisullo, Giovanni; Marca, Giacomo Della",Neurol. sci,315,32

Self-collection of capillary blood at home can facilitate the monitoring of patients with chronic disease to support virtual clinics while mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely used biochemical analytes and to develop and pilot a user-friendly home-collection kit to support virtual outpatient clinical services. METHODS: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely requested biochemical analytes, simultaneous samples of venous and capillary blood were collected in EDTA and lithium-heparin plasma separation tubes that were of 4-6 mL and 400-600 µL draw volume, respectively. Venous samples were analysed within 4 h of collection while capillary samples were kept at ambient temperature for three days until centrifugation and analysis. Analyte results that were comparable between the matrices were then piloted in a feasibility study in three outpatient clinical services. RESULTS: HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function tests were considered comparable and piloted in the patient feasibility study. The home-collect kit demonstrated good patient usability.

The main reason is that properties of P/Ns are associated with possible immunomodulating effects in the prevention and complementary treatment of viral diseases, including COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. In the present review, we assess the scientific plausibility of specific P/Ns for this purpose of preventative and therapeutic interventions against COVID-19, with an emphasis on safety, validity, and evidence of efficacy against other viruses. Five potential candidates have been identified after reviewing available studies (in silico, in vitro, and in vivo) in which certain flavonoids have demonstrated a potential for use as adjuvant therapeutic agents against viral infections, including COVID-19. As these are often better tolerated than pharmacological treatments, their use could be more widely considered if additional detailed studies can validate the existing evidence.","Pastor, Nitida; Collado, Maria Carmen; Manzoni, Paolo",Nutrients,315,16

This multiepitope antigen, which has a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa and contains a His-tag, was recognized by a CCoV-positive serum in a Western blot assay. The optimal concentration of rSP as a coating antigen in the ELISA was 2 µg/mL, and the optimal dilution of enzyme-labeled secondary antibody was 1:10,000. The cutoff OD450 value was established at 0.2395. No reactivity was observed with antisera against canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, or feline calicivirus, indicating that this assay is highly specific. We also tested 64 clinical serum samples using our newly established method, and the positive rate was found to be 82.8%. In conclusion, our assay was found to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of antibodies against CCoV, and it can therefore serve as a new, efficient diagnostic method.","Hao, Yun-Feng; Li, Shao-Han; Zhang, Guang-Zhi; Xu, Yi; Long, Guang-Zong; Lu, Xiao-Xiong; Cui, Shang-Jin; Qin, Tong",Arch Virol,315,5

L’informatique biomédicale repose en grande partie sur les données structurées qui requièrent l’existence de données ou de modèles de connaissances. Cependant, une nouvelle maladie ne peut avoir de modèle de connaissances préexistant. Au cours d’une épidémie de maladie émergente, le traitement automatique de la langue (TAL) peut permettre la conversion rapide de données textuelles non structurées en un nouveau modèle de connaissances. Bien que cette idée ait déjà été suggérée, il n’y avait pas eu jusqu’à présent d’opportunité pour la tester en temps réel. La pandémie actuelle de COVID-19 en est une. L’objectif de cette étude était de montrer la valeur ajoutée de l’extraction par TAL de l’information clinique présente dans les textes pour répondre aux questions posées dans le cadre d’une maladie émergente. Méthodes Nous avons exploré les effets à long-terme des traitements par inhibiteurs calciques sur le devenir des patients hypertendus, hospitalisés pour une infection COVID-19. Dans l’entrepôt de données de santé de l’AP-HP, nous avons comparé deux sources différentes d’information : les données structurées (codes diagnostics CIM10, résultats biologiques, prescriptions médicamenteuses) et les données extraites des textes cliniques par TAL. Résultats Dans cette étude multicentrique sur les 39 hôpitaux de l’AP-HP, le TAL a permis d’augmenter suffisamment la puissance statistique pour rendre significatif un résultat de risque relatif ajusté alors qu’il ne l’était pas avec les données structurées uniquement (Fig. 1).

Sleep disturbances are complex and caused by several factors and are difficult to treat. There is a need for more robust and systematic studies dealing with sleep disturbances in older people with dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate effects from robot-assisted (Paro) group activity on sleep patterns in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Special care units in 10 NH in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 60 participants over 65 years with dementia were recruited. Thirty participants were recruited to the intervention group and 30 participants to the control group. INTERVENTION: Participants participated in group activity with Paro for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks or in control group (treatment as usual). MEASUREMENTS: Sleep-wake patterns were assessed objectively by 7 days of wrist actigraphy before and after the intervention. Data were collected between March 2013 and September 2014. Data were analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: Positive effects on change in sleep were found in the intervention group as compared with the control group. The intervention group increased percentage of sleep efficiency, increased the amount of total sleep time and reduced number of nocturnal awakenings. In addition, a significant effect was found in reduced awakenings after sleep onset. CONCLUSIONS: Social stimulation through engaging group activity could contribute to improved sleep in people with dementia in NH. Increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, in addition to fewer night awakenings, affect central indicators of good sleep quality across the life span. Improved sleep quality will also affect quality of life and comorbidities in vulnerable groups. We believe group activity with Paro to be an accessible and feasible non-pharmacological treatment for those who enjoy Paro.","Jøranson, Nina; Olsen, Christine; Calogiuri, Giovanna; Ihlebæk, Camilla; Pedersen, Ingeborg",Int Psychogeriatr,315,1

This is a multi-phase observatory study conducted in the SG Moscati Hospital of Taranto in Italy that was converted into COVID-19 Special Care Unit for SARS-Co-V2 risk management. Patients were admitted to the 118 Emergency Pre-Hospital and Emergency Department based on two diagnostic criteria, the nasopharyngeal swab assessed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and CT-scan image characterized by ground glass opacity. Patients were divided into four groups, positive-positive (ER-PP), negative-positive (ER-NP), negative-negative (ER-NN) and a group admitted to the ICU (ER-IC). A further control group was added when the T and B lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Data included gender, age, vital signs, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), extensive laboratory results with microbiology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) which were analyzed and compared. Fundamental differences were reported among the groups. Males were significantly higher in PP, ICU, and NP groups, from 2 to 4-fold higher than females, while in the NN group, the number of females was mildly higher than males;the PP patients showed a marked alkalotic, hypoxic, hypocapnia ABG profile with hyperventilation at the time of admission;finally, the laboratory and microbiology results showed lymphopenia, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP, and eGFR were markedly anomalous.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants: and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of one year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV). Only five patients (also five hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng",,315,22

Our article aims to outline the validity of online assessment, the range of benefits to both candidate and assessor, and the challenges to its implementation. In addition, we propose pragmatic suggestions for its introduction into medical assessment. METHODS: We reviewed the literature concerning the present status of online medical and surgical assessment to establish the perceived benefits, limitations, and potential problems with this method of assessment. RESULTS: Global experience with online, remote virtual examination has been largely successful with many benefits conferred to the trainee, and both an economic and logistical advantage conferred to the assessor or organization. Advances in online examination software and remote proctoring are overcoming practical caveats including candidate authentication, cheating prevention, cybersecurity, and IT failure. CONCLUSION: Virtual assessment provides benefits to both trainee and assessor in medical and surgical examinations and may also result in cost savings. Virtual assessment is likely to be increasingly used in the post-COVID world and we present recommendations for the continued adoption of virtual examination.

The Ministry of Health mandated isolation of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and instructed healthcare institutions to make necessary arrangements. As the second Israeli hospital to establish a COVID-19 department, this article describes our experience in its rapid establishment, while maintaining normal medical center activities. SETTING: Establishing the COVID-19 department involved planning, set-up, and implementations phases, each one based on knowledge available regarding the pandemic and established medical standards for isolation and protection of patients and staff. Wherever possible, new innovative technologies were utilized to provide maximum protection for both patients and staff, together with special online training that was developed for medical teams. RESULTS: A COVID-19 department was successfully established on the hospital campus, remote from other ongoing patient activities. A novel methodology of disease-adapted medicine was implemented successfully among the department's medical staff, who underwent training tailored to expected clinical scenarios. The COVID-19 department is receiving patients, with no contamination of medical personnel to date. A recent survey of COVID-19 patients revealed a very high patient satisfaction rate. CONCLUSION: Based on the experience described herein and lessons learned, the hospital is preparing for a potential large-scale COVID-19 wave, aimed at full readiness through utilization of a fortified underground emergency hospital to treat up to 900 COVID-19 patients, and establishment of versatile in-hospital infrastructure for quick conversion from standard conditions to COVID-19 appropriate conditions.","Berger, Gidon; Horowitz, Netanel A; Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael; Gepstein, Vardit; Hussein, Khetam; Weismann, Avi; Hyams, Gila; Geffen, Yuval; Mekel, Michal; Halberthal, Michael",Am J Disaster Med,315,16

In the current study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large-scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome-scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (MFED of 7 to 9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analyzed and created by several hundred consecutive energetically favored stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-associated RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses-even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus that is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterized, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represents important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.IMPORTANCE The detection and characterization of large-scale RNA secondary structure in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 indicate an extraordinary and unsuspected degree of genome structural organization; this could be effectively visualized through a newly developed contour plotting method that displays positions, structural features, and conservation of RNA secondary structure between related viruses. Such RNA structure imposes a substantial evolutionary cost; paired sites showed greater restriction in diversity and represent a substantial additional constraint in reconstructing its molecular epidemiology. Its biological relevance arises from previously documented associations between possession of structured genomes and persistence, as documented for HCV and several other RNA viruses infecting humans and mammals. Shared properties potentially conferred by large-scale structure in SARS-CoV-2 include increasing evidence for prolonged infections and induced immune dysfunction that prevents development of protective immunity. The findings provide an additional element to cellular interactions that potentially influences the natural history of SARS-CoV-2, its pathogenicity, and its transmission.","Simmonds, P",mBio (Online),315,13

A significant number of patients develop a severe form of COVID-19 characterized by coagulopathy, organ failure, and elevated mortality. In addition, an unusually high frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) has been found in patients with COVID-19. These clinical and serological manifestations closely resemble those seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially in its catastrophic form, suggesting a role of aPLs in immune-associated coagulopathy. However, government bodies such as the American Society of Hematology have spoken out against the systematic search for aPLs in patients with COVID-19. In an attempt to bridge the gap on this hot topic, we conducted a comprehensive review of currently available cohort studies and case series systematically evaluating aPLs in COVID-19 patients. In this Perspective, we seek to identify both the frequency and the type of aPLs found in patients with COVID-19, as well as the potential association of these aPLs with vascular thrombosis and other distinctive characteristics of COVID-19. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is evidence that allows us to define the occurrence of aPLs in COVID-19 as an epiphenomenon, as has been observed in other systemic viral infections, or as antibodies against self-antigens bearing hallmarks that suggest a pathogenic role in immune-mediated thrombosis. Defining whether aPLs represent an epiphenomenon or they are actually involved in hemostatic abnormalities of COVID-19 is crucial both for uncovering novel mechanisms of immune-mediated thrombosis and for identifying potential prognostic biomarkers in this devastating disease.","Castillo-Martínez, Diana; Torres, Zaira; Amezcua-Guerra, Luis M; Pineda, Carlos",Clin Rheumatol,315,16

How do different categories of social media users' posts affect risk perception and vice versa? We use Granger causality analysis and impulse response functions to answer the research questions. The results show that from one perspective, the government and the media on Sina Weibo play critical roles in forming and affecting risk perceptions. From another perspective, risk perception promotes the posting of the media and the public on Sina Weibo. Since government's posting and media's posting can significantly enhance the public's perceptions of risk issues, the government and the media must remain vigilant to provide credible risk-related information.","Zhu, Huiyun; Liu, Kecheng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),315,27

Recently, rapid classification of virus species, analysis of genome and screening for effective drugs are the most important tasks. In the present study, through literature review, sequence alignment, ORF identification, motif recognition, secondary and tertiary structure prediction, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were comprehensively analyzed. To find effective drugs, the parameters of binding sites were calculated by SeeSAR. In addition, potential miRNAs were predicted according to RNA base-pairing. After prediction by using NCBI, WebMGA and GeneMark and comparison, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (>90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. Interestingly, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) were predicted to prevent virus replication via targeting 3'-UTR of the genome or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS. Drugs used to treat SARS may also be effective against the novel virus. In addition, altering miRNA expression may become a potential therapeutic schedule.","Chen, Long; Zhong, Li",,315,16

There are multiple surgical and nonsurgical treatments available, with the surgical options having greater and longer-lasting effects. Such treatments have evolved over time with advances in technology and research, with numerous patients researching these treatments on Google. Many surgeons who provide these treatments belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons (ISHRS). AIMS: To investigate trends in surgical hair restoration treatment from both the surgeon and patient perspectives. METHODS: Patient epidemiological and surgical data from the ISHRS were combined with search trend data from Google to analyze changing trends in surgical hair restoration treatment. RESULTS: Worldwide Internet searches for ""hair transplant"" have increased from 2004 to the present. Follicular unit excision (FUE) has supplanted follicular unit transplant (FUT) as the most popular hair transplant performed. Since 2004, there has been an increase in both nonsurgical and surgical female patients. Beard and eyebrow transplants have increased in popularity. Google searches follow this trend. Nonsurgical treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are being searched more frequently. Hair restoration clinics and Google searches were affected adversely by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Technological advances in available therapies, improvement in delivery systems, changes in hair fashion, and global events have direct impact on hair restoration treatments offered by physicians and researched by patients.

We find that a vaccine with effectiveness &#8805;50% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic, provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age groups first for high vaccination coverage.

Our objective is to describe the cardiac manifestations found in an international cohort of 55 pediatric cases with multi-system inflammatory syndrome during the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic. Methods and Results We reviewed data on previously healthy pediatric patients (&#8804;18 years) with structurally normal hearts who presented at hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, and Pakistan with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children and had consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory values, electrocardiographic abnormalities, echocardiographic findings, and initial therapies. A total of 55 patients presented with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. Thirty-five patients (64%) had evidence of decreased left ventricular function, 17 (31%) had valvulitis, 12 (22%) with pericardial effusion, and 11 (20%) with coronary abnormalities. Twenty-seven (49%) required intensive care unit admission and 24 (44%) had evidence of shock. Eleven patients (20%) fulfilled complete Kawasaki disease criteria and had lower NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), D-dimer, and ferritin levels compared with those who did not fulfill criteria. Electrophysiologic abnormalities occurred in 6 patients and included complete atrioventricular block, transient atrioventricular block, and ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions To our knowledge, we describe the first international cohort of pediatric patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children during the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic with a range of cardiac manifestations.

However, using infectious SARS-CoV-2 requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3), which limits the techniques that can be used to study the mechanism of cell entry. Here, we UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and fluorescently labeled the envelope membrane with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) to explore the role of integrin activation in mediating both cell entry and productive infection. We used flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy to show that fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2R18 particles engage basal-state integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mn2+, which activates integrins and induces integrin extension, enhances cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2R18 in proportion to the fraction of integrins activated. We also show that one class of integrin antagonist, which binds to the I MIDAS site and stabilizes the inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2R18 with basal state integrins, but is ineffective against Mn2+-activated integrins. At the same time, RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2R18 binding regardless of integrin activity state. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally: inside-out signaling primes the ligand binding function of integrins via a talin dependent mechanism and outside-in signaling occurs downstream of integrin binding to macromolecular ligands. Outside-in signaling is mediated by G13 and induces cell spreading, retraction, migration, and proliferation. Using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin, and G13 binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrins {beta} subunit, we further demonstrate that talin-mediated signaling is essential for productive infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Simons, Peter; Rinaldi, Derek; Bondu, Virginie; Kell, Alison; Bradfute, Steven; Lidke, Diane; Buranda, Tione",,315,12

Understanding of donor and product characteristics is important for optimization of convalescent plasma. Methods: Patients who had recovered from CO­VID-19 were recruited as donors for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of severe COVID-19 (CAPSID Trial). Titers of neutralizing antibodies were measured by a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Correlation of antibody titers with host factors and evolution of neutralizing antibody titers over time in repeat donors were analysed. Results: A series of 144 donors (41% females, 59% males;median age 40 years) underwent 319 plasmapheresis procedures providing a median collection volume of 850 mL and a mean number of 2.7 therapeutic units per plasmapheresis. The majority of donors had a mild or moderate course of COVID-19. The titers of neutralizing antibodies varied greatly between CCP donors (from &lt;1:20 to &gt;1:640). Donor factors (gender, age, ABO type, body weight) did not correlate significantly with the titer of neutralizing antibodies. We observed a significant positive correlation of neutralization titers with the number of reported COVID-19 symptoms and with the time from SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to plasmapheresis. Neutralizing antibody levels were stable or increased over time in 58% of repeat CCP donors. Mean titers of neutralizing antibodies of first donation and last donation of repeat CCP donors did not differ significantly (1:86 at first compared to 1:87 at the last donation). There was a significant correlation of neutralizing antibodies measured by PRNT and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies which were measured by ELISA. CCP donations with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody content above the 25th percentile were substantially enriched for CCP donations with higher neutralizing antibody levels. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of collection of a large number of CCP products under a harmonized protocol for a randomized clinical trial. Titers of neutralizing antibodies were stable or increased over time in a subgroup of repeat donors. A history of higher number of COVID-19 symptoms and higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies in immunoassays can preselect donations with higher neutralizing capacity.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older who visited Duke University Health System between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2015. METHODS: An electronic query of patient records at Duke University Health System was performed to identify patients with and without diagnoses of OAG, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), vascular dementia (VD), senile dementia (SD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other neurodegenerative diseases. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR). Age group, race, and gender were included as covariates in multiple logistic regression analyses to calculate adjusted ORs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative disease in OAG patients with the odds in control patients. RESULTS: A total of 1 511 602 patients were included in this study: 24 892 OAG patients and 1 484 790 control patients. Mean age was 58.9 ± 14.0 years for OAG patients and 44.9 ± 14.1 years for control patients. After adjusting for age, race, and gender, the OR comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative disease in OAG patients with the odds in control patients were as follows: for AD: adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.93; for ALS: adjusted OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49); for PD: adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13; for VD: adjusted OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25; for SD: adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.41; for MCI: adjusted OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.79-2.22; and for other neurodegenerative disease: adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.51-2.10. CONCLUSIONS: Open-angle glaucoma patients may have increased odds of SD, MCI, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further work is necessary to identify potential causal relationships. A negative correlation exists between OAG and ALS diagnosis that is likely related to limited life expectancy and physical limitations in ALS patients. A weak negative correlation exists between OAG and AD diagnosis. No correlation exists between OAG and PD or VD.","Umunakwe, Obinna; Gupta, Divakar; Tseng, Henry",,315,13

However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable. To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation. The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus improving the return on investment.

Pharmacovigilance centres permanently monitor the safety profile of medicines, ensuring risk management to evaluate the benefit-risk relationship. However, traditional pharmacovigilance approaches of spontaneous reporting, are not suitable in the context of a pandemic; the scientific community and regulators need information on a near real-time point. The aim of this commentary is to suggest six interrelated multidimensional guiding axes for drug safety management by pharmacovigilance centres during the COVID-19 pandemic. This working plan can increase knowledge on COVID-19 and associated therapeutic approaches, support decisions by the regulatory authorities, oppose fake news and promote more efficient public health protection.","Ferreira-da-Silva, Renato; Ribeiro-Vaz, Inês; Morato, Manuela; Polónia, Jorge Junqueira",Int. j. clin. pharm,315,24

How other factors can explain this bias remains unclear. So two experiments investigated how complying with public health recommendations during the COVID19 pandemic depended on victim portrayal, reflection, and philosophical beliefs (Total N = 998). Only one experiment found that messaging about individual victims increased compliance compared to messaging about statistical victims-i.e., ""flatten the curve"" graphs-an effect that was undetected after controlling for other factors. However, messaging about flu (vs. COVID19) indirectly reduced compliance by reducing perceived threat of the pandemic. Nevertheless, moral beliefs predicted compliance better than messaging and reflection in both experiments. The second experiment's additional measures revealed that religiosity, political preferences, and beliefs about science also predicted compliance. This suggests that flouting public health recommendations may be less about ineffective messaging or reasoning than philosophical differences.","Byrd, Nick; Bialek, Michal",Cognition,315,6

Although LMSs with lots of features were developed for universities, the success of those systems is highly related to a detailed understanding of challenges and factors influencing the use of the systems among their users. HELMS (Higher Education Learning Management System) is a countrywide LMS used for teaching and learning during the quarantine period caused by covid-19 in Afghanistan universities. As it was the first experience of Afghan universities in using the learning management systems during the pandemic, challenges were expected to appear. No previous research has been conducted on either studying the challenges of using the HELMS or investigating the factors influencing the use of HELMS during the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan. Hence, there was no unified view of the potential challenges of using HELMS and factors influencing the use of the HELMS among the researchers. This research aims to investigate the challenges that face the use of HELMS and explore the factors influencing the use of HELMS among both lecturers and students. This study employed a qualitative research method by conducting semi-structured interviews with 100 participants including university management, lecturers, and students. Thematic analysis was used as a method for the analysis of qualitative data. The findings of this research will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in public and private universities to grasp knowledge on the successful implementation and use of LMSs during covid-19 and afterward.","Mohammadi, Mustafa Kamel; Mohibbi, Abdul Aziz; Hedayati, Mohammad Hadi",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),315,7

This Viewpoint addresses that question in the context of a middle-income country, South Africa. Based on a review of much of the evidence available at the time of publication, it concludes that the youngest children are least susceptible to harm from COVID-19, are less likely to spread the virus than adults, and also have the most to lose by being out of school.

RECENT FINDINGS: The diagnosis of IE is challenging because of the highly variable clinical presentations, especially in the case of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). FDG PET/CT has been shown to play an important role for the diagnosis of PVE as a major Duke criterion. Whether FDG PET/CT could play a similar role in patients with suspected native valve endocarditis (NVE) is less well established. It is increasingly recognized that IE is a multisystem disorder, and identification of extra-cardiac manifestations on whole-body FDG PET/CT impacts management and prognosis of patients with IE. Finally, FDG PET/CT provides incremental prognostic value over other clinical and para-clinical parameters, enabling prediction of in-hospital mortality, IE recurrence, hospitalization, and new onset heart failure and embolic events. FDG PET/CT plays a key role in the investigation of patients with suspected IE, enabling detection of valvular infection and extra-cardiac manifestations of the infection which has important prognostic implications.","Pelletier-Galarneau, Matthieu; Abikhzer, Gad; Harel, Francois; Dilsizian, Vasken",Curr Cardiol Rep,315,7

With the cases increasing daily, it is becoming more and more essential to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease. It is now well known that the infection manifests itself primarily as respiratory, but the involvement of the other organ systems has now been documented in many studies. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system by a multitude of proposed mechanisms that have been discussed in this review. NF-&#954;B and Nrf2 are transcription factors that regulate genes responsible for inflammatory and anti-oxidant response respectively. Specific focus in this review has been given to NF-&#954;B and Nrf2 pathways that are involved in the cytokine storm and oxidative stress that are the hallmarks of COVID-19. As the immune injury is an important mechanism of neuro-invasion and neuroinflammation, there is the possible involvement of these two pathways in the neurological complications. The crosstalk mechanisms of these signaling pathways have also been discussed. Immuno-modulators both synthetic and natural are promising candidates in catering to the pathologies targeted in the aforementioned pathways.","Bhandari, Ranjana; Khanna, Garima; Kaushik, Dhriti; Kuhad, Anurag",Mol.

METHODS: We conducted a three-part survey comprising neurologists, people with epilepsy (PWE), and 11 specialized epilepsy centers across India. We sent two separate online survey questionnaires to Indian neurologists and PWE to assess the epilepsy practice, seizures control, and access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected and compared the data concerning the number of PWE cared for and epilepsy procedures performed during the 6 months periods preceding and following COVID-19 lockdown from epilepsy centers. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 453 neurologists and 325 PWE. One third of the neurologist reported >50 % decline in outdoor visits by PWE and EEG recordings. The cumulative data from 11 centers showed 65-70 % decline in the number of outdoor patients, video-EEG monitoring, and epilepsy surgery. Working in a hospital admitting COVID-19 patients and use of teleconsultation correlated with this decline. Half of PWE had postponed their planned outpatient visits and EEG. Less than 10 % of PWE missed their antiseizure medicines (ASM) or had seizures due to the nonavailability of ASM. Seizure control remained unchanged or improved in 92 % PWE. Half of the neurologists started using teleconsultation during the pandemic. Only 4% of PWE were afflicted with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant decline in the number of PWE visiting hospitals, their seizure control and access to ASMs were not affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

METHODS: We conducted an investigation of the first known outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Illinois on March 15, 2020 and followed residents for 30 days. We tested 126/127 residents for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR and performed symptom assessments. We calculated the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and assessed symptom onset over 30-day follow-up to determine: 1) the proportion of cases who were symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic and 2) incidence of symptoms among those who tested negative. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to determine the 30-day probability of death for cases. RESULTS: Of 126 residents tested, 33 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on March 15. Nineteen (58%) had symptoms at the time of testing, 1 (3%) developed symptoms over follow-up, and 13 (39%) remained asymptomatic. Thirty-five residents who tested negative on March 15 developed symptoms over follow-up; of these, 3 were re-tested and 2 were positive. The 30-day probability of death among cases was 29%. CONCLUSIONS: SNFs are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and residents are at risk of severe outcomes. Attention must be paid to preventing outbreaks in these and other congregate care settings.

Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data mining methods will also be used. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic; demographic correlates of distress; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for practitioners and useful for informing policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions during the pandemic.

The ratio of the number of fatalities to the number of cases (case fatality ratio, CFR) recorded in Italy was surprisingly high and increased in the month of March. The older mean age of population, the changes in testing policy, and the methodological computation of CFR were previously reported as possible explanations for the incremental trend of CFR, a parameter theoretically expected to be constant. In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach. This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings. The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1–3-day delay of positive cases. This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation. The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function. The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units.","Iosa, Marco; Paolucci, Stefano; Morone, Giovanni",Front.

Anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody-containing plasmas, obtained from the recovered individuals who had confirmed COVID-19, have been started to be collected using apheresis devices and stored in blood banks in some countries in order to administer to the patients with COVID-19 for reducing the need of intensive care and the mortality rates. Therefore, in this review, we aim to point out some important issues related to convalescent plasma (CP) and its use in COVID-19. CP may be an adjunctive treatment option to the anti-viral therapy. The protective effect of CP may continue for weeks and months. After the assessment of the donor, 200-600 mL plasma can be collected with apheresis devices. The donation interval may vary between countries. Even though limited published studies are not prospective or randomized, until the development of vaccines or therapeutics, CP seems to be a safe and probably effective treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19. It could also be used for prophylactic purposes but the safety and effectiveness of this approach should be tested in randomized prospective clinical trials.","Yigenoglu, Tugçe Nur; Hacibekiroglu, Tuba; Berber, Ilhami; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Bastürk, Abdülkadir; Namdaroglu, Sinem; Korkmaz, Serdal; Ulas, Turgay; Dal, Tuba; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Turgut, Burhan; Altuntas, Fevzi",J Clin Apher,315,16

While this is so, it is incumbent on the management of radiotherapy centres to ensure that patients, patient care-givers and radiotherapy personnel are at all times safe within the radiotherapy facility. Cancer patients are known to have increased risk for respiratory viruses like Covid-19 due to the compromised immune state of such persons. It is thus important to institute adequate safety measures in radiotherapy centres to prevent infection of cancer patients during the global Covid-19 pandemic. A survey conducted in 12 radiotherapy centres in 8 African countries has highlighted key measures needing implementation to ensure safety against Covid-19 infections. The safety measures were indexed on a 16-point questionnaire covering 5 main areas of staffing, radiotherapy environment, equipment and treatment protocols, patient condition and scheduling, and education/sensitization. The study shows that use of personal protective equipment, provision of hand washing and sanitizing facilities, social distance observance, restrictions for patient care-givers, provision of isolation unit meant for holding suspected Covid-19 cases, existence of working protocols, and Covid-19 safety education for staff are fully complied with by the surveyed radiotherapy centres. A greater portion of the centres, are however, without radiotherapy facilities solely dedicated for suspicious and confirmed Covid-19 cases. Strict adherence of the safety measures is highly essential to contain the spread and prevent infection of the disease to patients, care-givers and staff of the radiotherapy departments.","Hasford, Francis; Ige, Taofeeq Abdallah; Trauernicht, Christoph",Health Technol (Berl),315,1

In the United States (US), different state governments have adopted various combinations of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs), such as non-essential business closures and gathering bans, to mitigate the epidemic from February to April, 2020. Quantitative assessment on the effectiveness of NPIs is greatly needed to assist in guiding individualized decision making for adjustment of interventions in the US and around the world. However, the impacts of these approaches remain uncertain. METHODS: Based on the reported cases, the effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 epidemic for 50 states in the US was estimated. Measurements on the effectiveness of nine different NPIs were conducted by assessing risk ratios (RRs) between Rt and NPIs through a generalized linear model (GLM). RESULTS: Different NPIs were found to have led to different levels of reduction in Rt.

The burden of caring for persons with dementia also decreases the quality of life of family caregivers. The objective of this study was to assess the societal cost-effectiveness of Namaste Care Family program in comparison with usual care in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: Nursing homes were randomized to either Namaste Care Family program or usual care. Outcome measures of the cluster-randomized trial in 231 residents included Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) and the Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument (GAIN) for family caregivers over 12 months of follow-up. Health states were measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire which were translated into utilities. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the amount of time a participant spent in a specific health state with the utility score associated with that health state. Healthcare utilization costs were estimated using standard unit costs, while intervention costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapped multilevel models were used after multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: The Namaste Care Family program was more effective than usual care in terms of QUALID (- 0.062, 95%CI: - 0.40 to 0.28), QALY (0.0017, 95%CI: - 0.059 to 0.063) and GAIN (0.075, 95%CI: - 0.20 to 0.35). Total societal costs were lower for the Namaste Care Family program as compared to usual care (- 552 , 95%CI: - 2920 to 1903). However, these differences were not statistically significant. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a ceiling ratio of 0 /unit of effect extra was 0.70 for the QUALID, QALY and GAIN. CONCLUSIONS: The Namaste Care Family program is dominant over usual care and, thus, cost-effective, although statistical uncertainty was considerable.

We fitted mixed effects models to examine the associations between two outcome measures, depression and self-rated health, and their multilevel determinants using a subset of Global Behaviors and Perceptions in the COVID-19 Pandemic, an online survey consisting of more than 100,000 participants from 67 nations. Results show that both personal beliefs and general beliefs significantly predict depression and poor health. There is also a contextual effect of globalization on depression. In addition, the relationship between general beliefs and depression is stronger in countries with lower rates of mobility. With respect to poor health, the effect of general beliefs similarly varies inversely with the level of globalization. Our study indicates that one's own beliefs and the perception of others' regarding social distancing, along with contextual factors (measures of mobility and globalization), critically shape mental and physical health.

All have associations with human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities that may be either neurologic or constitutional. Neurotropism and neurovirulence are dependent in part on CNS expression of cell surface receptors mediating viral entry, and host immune response. In adults, CNS receptors for epidemic viruses are largely expressed on brain vasculature, whereas receptors for less pathogenic viruses are present in vasculature, brain parenchyma, and olfactory neuroepithelium, dependent upon viral species. Human coronaviruses can infect circulating mononuclear cells, but meningoencephalitis is rare. Well-documented human neuropathologies are infrequent and, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, can entail cerebrovascular accidents originating extrinsically to brain. There is evidence of neuronal infection in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates with SARS-CoV, and CSF studies of rare patients with seizures have demonstrated virus but no pleocytosis. In contrast to human disease, animal models of neuropathogenesis are well developed, and pathologies including demyelination, neuronal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis are seen with both native CoVs as well as human CoVs inoculated into nasal cavities or brain. This review covers basic CoV biology pertinent to CNS disease; the spectrum of clinical abnormalities encountered in infants, children, and adults; and the evidence for CoV infection of human brain, with reference to pertinent animal models of neuropathogenesis.","Morgello, Susan",J Neurovirol,315,30

We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine treatment for outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could prevent hospitalization, mechanical ventilation or death. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Alberta during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic without direct contact with participants. Community-dwelling individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] viral ribonucleic acid test) within the previous 4 days, and symptom onset within the previous 12 days, were randomly assigned to oral hydroxychloroquine or matching placebo for 5 days. Enrolment began Apr. 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the composite of hospitalization, invasive mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included symptom duration and disposition at 30 days. Safety outcomes, such as serious adverse events and mortality, were also ascertained. Outcomes were determined by telephone follow-up and administrative data. RESULTS: Among 4919 individuals with a positive RT-PCR test, 148 (10.2% of a planned 1446 patients) were randomly assigned, 111 to hydroxychloroquine and 37 to placebo. Of the 148 participants, 24 (16.2%) did not start the study drug. Four participants in the hydroxychloroquine group met the primary outcome (4 hospitalizations, 0 mechanical ventilation, 4 survived to 30 days) and none in the placebo group. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce symptom duration (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.21). Recruitment was paused on May 22, 2020, when a since-retracted publication raised concerns about the safety of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Although we had not identified concerns in a safety review, enrolment was slower than expected among those eligible for the study, and cases within the community were decreasing. Recruitment goals were deemed to be unattainable and the trial was not resumed, resulting in a study underpowered to assess the effect of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and safety. INTERPRETATION: There was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced symptom duration or prevented severe outcomes among outpatients with proven COVID-19, but the early termination of our study meant that it was underpowered.

The elderly with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular and lung diseases, diabetes, obesity, are the most vulnerable to this disease. Curing the pre-existing health conditions will greatly increase a person's resilience to COVID-19 and lower the death rate of the old people. Digestion and immunity form an integrated nutrition acquisition process, especially in obtaining essential amino acids and essential fatty acids from living microbial cells. A mature strong immunity coupled with gut dysbiosis in adults is the main cause of nutritional disorders like morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Nutrition disorders in return worsen dysbiosis. Human microbiome has an intrinsic duality. While a diverse microbiome provides a full spectrum of essential nutrients to our body, nutrition disorders fuel overgrowth of microbiota (dysbiosis) at many sites on or inside our body, and are the main causes of chronic inflammation at these sites. In the case of COVID-19, nutritional disorder impairs the immunity, causes hyperinflammation, and leads to the protracted overload of cytokines by the immune system, i.e., the cytokine storm. Autophagy induced by restrictive eating is an ideal inhibitor of microbiota overgrowth, as autophagy deprives microbiota of excessive nutrition for replication. Autophagy also attenuates inflammation. Therefore, as a precaution, the author suggests restoring good health in the elderly with the support from a diverse gut microbiome and daily regular food intake restriction, so as to lower the risk of developing into severe case even if they are infected by COVID-19.","Yu, Ligen",Indian J Microbiol,315,16

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined.Objectives: To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.Methods: Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management.Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]), and glucocorticoid (65 [76.5%]) treatments. A total of 38 (44.7%) and 33 (38.8%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and IFN-&#945;2b, respectively.Conclusions: In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis.

276266,276266,276266,Abstracts of the Annual Congress of the Swiss Society of Rheumatology,15.274203,6.312377,2021,"Data sources This review included 13 clinical studies (observational or clinical trial) which reported results of studies of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc).Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers.Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV.Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts.Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence.","Shamsoddin, Erfan",Evid Based Dent,315,16

The aim of this study was to investigate and compare independent predictors of symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Brazilians, one month after the implementation of measures of social distancing. MethodsIt was a cross-sectional study, performed through a web-based survey. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were the outcomes. Data were gathered regarding demographics, social distancing, economic problems, exposure to the news of the pandemic, psychiatric history, sleep disturbances, traumatic situations, and substance use. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C) was also included. Predictors of symptoms were investigated through hierarchical multiple linear regression. ResultOf a sample of 3,587 participants, approximately two-thirds considered that their mental health worsened after the beginning of the social restriction measures. The most important predictors of the symptoms investigated were the intensity of the distress related to pandemic news, younger age, current psychiatric diagnosis, trouble sleeping, emotional abuse or violence, and economic problems. LimitationsThe convenience sample assessed online may have limited external validity. It does not represent the northern regions of the country and most participants was white wealthier females.

Specifically, the NH acidity of simple hydroxamic acid derivatives facilitated the syntheses of novel ß-lactams (oxamazins and monobactams), siderophore mimics that limit bacterial iron uptake and bacterially targeted sideromycins (siderophore-antibiotic conjugates). The development of resistance to our current limited set of antibiotic scaffolds has created a dire medical situation. As recently stated, ""if you weren't taking antibiotic resistance seriously before, now would be a good time to start."" A project commissioned by the British government (https://amr-review.org/) has released estimates of the near-future global toll of antibiotic resistance that are jaw-dropping in their seriousness and scale: 10 million deaths per year and at least $100 trillion in sacrificed gross national product. The 2020 COVID pandemic confirmed that infectious disease problems are no longer localized but worldwide. Many classical antibiotics, especially ß-lactams, previously provided economical cures, but the evolution of antibiotic destructive enzymes (i.e., ß-lactamases), efflux pumps, and bacterial cell wall permeability barriers has made many types of bacteria, especially Gram-negative strains, resistant. Still, and in contrast to other therapies, the public expectation is that any new antibiotic must be inexpensive. This creates market limitations that have caused most major pharmaceutical companies to abandon antibiotic research. Much needs to be done to address this significant problem.The critical need for bacteria to sequester essential iron provides an Achilles' heel for new antibiotic development. Although ferric iron is extremely insoluble, bacteria need micromolar intracellular concentrations for growth and virulence. To this end, they biosynthesize siderophores (Gr. iron bearer) and excrete them into their environment, where they bind iron with high affinity. The iron complexes are recognized by specific outer-membrane transporters, and once actively internalized, the iron is released for essential processes. To conserve biosynthetic energy, some bacteria recognize and utilize siderophores made by competing strains. As a counter-revolution in the never-ending fight for survival, bacteria have also evolved sideromycins, which are siderophores conjugated to warheads that are lethal to rogue bacteria. While none are now used therapeutically, natural sideromycins called albomycins have been used clinically, and others have been shown to be well tolerated and active in animal infection models. Herein we describe practical methods to synthesize new antibiotics and artificial sideromycins with the generalized structure shown above (siderophore-linker drug). Utilizing the molecular-recognition-based siderophore/sideromycin bacterial assimilation processes, it is possible to design both broad spectrum and exquisitely narrow spectrum (targeted) sideromycins and even repurpose older or more classical antibiotics. Relevant microbiological assays, in vivo animal infection studies, and the recent FDA approval of cefiderocol demonstrate their effectiveness.","Miller, Marvin J; Liu, Rui",Acc Chem Res,315,29

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries' characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Compared with Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","Diop, Binta Zahra; Ngom, Marieme; Pougué Biyong, Clémence; Pougué Biyong, John N",,315,5

Alveolospheres exhibit indolent growth in a Wnt- and R-spondin-dependent manner. Gene expression, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses reveal the presence of alveolar cells in alveolospheres. Alveolospheres express ACE2 and allow SARS-CoV-2 to propagate nearly 100,000-fold in 3 days of infection. Whereas lopinavir and nelfinavir, protease inhibitors used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, have a modest anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, a nucleotide prodrug, shows an anti-viral effect at the concentration comparable with the circulating drug level.

An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records will be significantly valuable to accelerate various applications of COVID-19 research. To this end, the existing clinical NLP tool CLAMP was quickly adapted to COVID-19 information and generated an automated tool called COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract and signs/symptoms and their eight attributes such as temporal information and negations from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard clinical concepts in the common data model of OHDSI OMOP. Evaluation on clinical notes and medical dialogues demonstrated promising results.

In this viewpoint, we delineate specific telehealth opportunities that teach core competencies for patient care, while also teaching telemedicine-specific skills. Schools can further augment student education through a variety of telemedicine initiatives across multiple medical fields. The explosion of telemedicine programs due to the pandemic can be a catalyst for schools to integrate telemedicine into their current curricula.

Immunocompetent hosts have intact defense mechanisms to prevent HPV infection, but immunocompromised patients are at higher risks of complications including HPV related cancers. Most of these cancers originate from high-risk HPV strains in sexually active patients. CASE: Here we present a case of an immunocompromised adolescent who developed cervical cancer despite no prior sexually activity and only ever having low-risk type HPV on biopsy. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a cervical cancer arising from a low-risk HPV strain in an immunocompromised non-sexually active adolescent. This case highlights the importance of preventative and screening mechanisms in immunocompromised populations as they are at a higher probability of HPV related complications, even in absence of traditional risk factors.","Evans, Melanie; Lawson, Ashli; Jarin, Jason D; Wilson, Ellen E",J. pediatr. adolesc. gynecol,315,19

This study presents data on the results of economic games for sharing with a potential friend or unfamiliar peer in three ethnic groups of East Africa (Hadza, Iraqw, and Meru). The total sample was 583 children and adolescents; mean age, 13.5 ± 3.1 years. In addition, DNA analysis was carried out and the OXTR gene rs53576 single nucleotide polymorphism was genotyped for 162 Meru individuals. The pronounced individual variability in making decisions on sharing with a potential partner was established. Children and adolescents behaved altruistically towards friends significantly more frequently as compared with strangers. Carriers of the OXTR rs53576 GG variant displayed altruism significantly more frequently both to friends (U = 3376.500, p = 0.047; OR = 3.075, p = 0.032) and to strangers (U = 3478.000, p = 0.025; OR = 3.133, p = 0.007).

Haplotype analysis of patients with similar ancestry revealed two different founder mutations in Southern Europe and France, indicating that the prevalence in these populations may be higher. In our study all patients presented with highly similar clinical features: adult-onset, usually distal more than proximal limb muscle weakness, slowly progressing over decades with preserved walking. Lower limb muscle imaging showed a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement and fatty degeneration. Histopathological and electron microscopic analysis of patient muscle biopsies revealed myopathic findings with rimmed vacuoles and the presence of sarcoplasmic inclusions, some with amyloid-like characteristics.

METHODS: Twelve formalin-fixed fetuses (six females and six males) with a mean gestational age of 27.0 ± 2.04 weeks (range between 25 and 32 weeks) were dissected to evaluate morphological properties of the spinal cord and rootlets. RESULTS: Length and width of each spinal cord segment, number of dorsal and ventral rootlets, length of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones of each spinal nerve, spinal cord termination level, and the whole spinal cord length were determined in all fetuses. Contrary to previous reports, the number of ventral rootlets was always more than that of dorsal rootlets in all segments. No statistically significant gender difference was found for all parameters. Rootlet number and segment width in cervical region were larger than those of thoracic, while the lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones in thoracic region were longer than those of cervical. In lumbar region, dorsal and ventral rootlet numbers were increasing again, while lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones were decreasing. Number of dorsal and ventral rootlets of C5 and C6 segments was statistically higher than other cervical segments. The mean spinal cord length was found as 105.55 ± 11.30 mm and there was a positive significant relationship with gestational age. Conus medullaris level was detected between L1 and L3 segments. CONCLUSION: Detailed microsurgical data about the fetal spinal cord and the dorsal and ventral rootlets presented in this study provide significant information which may be essential during surgical interventions in early postnatal period and childhood targeting the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots.","Elvan, Özlem; Aktekin, Mustafa; Kayan, Gülden",,315,6

Clinically, respiratory tract symptoms as well as other organs disorders are observed in patients positively diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, neurological symptoms, mainly anosmia, ageusia and headache were observed in many patients. Once in the central nervous system (CNS), the SARS-CoV-2 can reside either in a quiescent latent state, or eventually in actively state leading to severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuroinflammation and prolonged neuroimmune activation. SRAS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The expression of this receptor in endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows that SRAS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to known coronaviruses. This review summarizes available information regarding the impact of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain and tended to identify its potential pathways of neuroinvasion. We offer also an understanding of the long-term impact of latently form of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of neurodegenerative disorders.

POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Triâ¢Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data ""clouds"" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high.

As the infection continues to spread, many medical institutions have devoted all efforts to minimize the risk of infection not only for patients but also for medical personnel by prioritizing medical care, reserving treatment, and extending consultation intervals. Cancer treatment is one of the priorities for medical care even during an epidemic infection as there is a concern of decreasing curability or therapeutic effect from postponement.

The objective of this study was to analyze the seroprevalence and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 among users of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), disoproxil fumarate/FTC (TDF/FTC), or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC and to compare it to that of a control group. Methods: An observational descriptive study of the seroprevalence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 among men who have sex with men and transgender women without use of PrEP (Group 1; nâ =â 250) and PrEP users with TDF/FTC (nâ =â 409) or TAF/FTC (nâ =â 91) (Group 2; nâ =â 500) was conducted from May11, 2020 to June 27, 2020. All participants were provided with a structured questionnaire that collected information on the variables to be analyzed, and testing for immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay) was then carried out. Results: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 9.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-13.5) in the group without PrEP and 15.0% (95% CI, 12.0-18.4) in the group with PrEP (Pâ =â .026). Among users of TDF/FTC it was 14.7% (95% CI, 11.4-18.5), and in users of TAF/FTC it was 16.5% (95% CI, 9.5-25.7) (Pâ =â .661). In those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and receiving PrEP, 57.4% manifested symptoms, compared with 78.3% in the control group (Pâ =â .070). In users of TDF/FTC the figure was 53.3% and in users of TAF/FTC the figure was 73.3% (Pâ =â .100). The duration of symptoms was 11.5 days in the control group, 9.0 days in PrEP users (Pâ =â .116), 7.0 days in users of TDF/FTC, and 13.0 days in users of TAF/FTC (Pâ =â .100). Conclusions: Users of PrEP, TDF/FTC, or TAF/FTC presented a higher seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 than the control group. No statistically significant differences were found in relation to clinical manifestations.

These probes, in combination with label-free quantitative proteomics, allow exploring cytosolic protein assemblies such as phosphotyrosine-mediated protein complexes formed in response to minute-scale EGF stimulation. As proof-of-concept, we systematically profile the spatiotemporal interactome of the EGFR signaling component STS1. For STS1 core complexes, our proximity proteomics approach shows comparable performance to affinity purification-mass spectrometry-based temporal interactome profiling, while also capturing additional-especially endosomally-located-protein complexes. In summary, we provide a generic approach for exploring the interactome of mobile cytosolic proteins in living cells at a temporal resolution of minutes.","Ke, Mi; Yuan, Xiao; He, An; Yu, Peiyuan; Chen, Wendong; Shi, Yu; Hunter, Tony; Zou, Peng; Tian, Ruijun",Nat Commun,315,16

These in turn impact the established world economy, create jobless situations, physical, mental, emotional stress, and challenge the human survival. Therefore, timely detection, treatment, isolation and prevention of spreading the pandemic infectious diseases not beyond the originated town is critical to avoid global impairment of life (e.g., Corona virus disease - 2019, COVID-19). The objective of this review article is to emphasize the recent advancements in the electrochemical diagnostics of twelve life-threatening viruses namely - COVID-19, Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza, Hepatitis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), Zika virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya, Dengue, and Rotavirus. This review describes the design, principle, underlying rationale, receptor, and mechanistic aspects of sensor systems reported for such viruses. Electrochemical sensor systems which comprised either antibody or aptamers or direct/mediated electron transfer in the recognition matrix were explicitly segregated into separate sub-sections for critical comparison. This review emphasizes the current challenges involved in translating laboratory research to real-world device applications, future prospects and commercialization aspects of electrochemical diagnostic devices for virus detection. The background and overall progress provided in this review are expected to be insightful to the researchers in sensor field and facilitate the design and fabrication of electrochemical sensors for life-threatening viruses with broader applicability to any desired pathogens.","Goud, K Yugender; Reddy, K Koteshwara; Khorshed, Ahmed; Kumar, V Sunil; Mishra, Rupesh K; Oraby, Mohamed; Ibrahim, Alyaa Hatem; Kim, Hern; Gobi, K Vengatajalabathy",Biosens Bioelectron,315,24

METHODS: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset. RESULTS: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251 to 1.431). These findings were consistent with the analysis based on the NHIS data using 704 final subjects. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.303 (95% CI, 0.135 to 0.682), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.391 to 1.682).

Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society. We call on psychologists to advocate for social justice in pandemic preparedness, promote disability justice in health care settings, call for transparency and accountability in rationing approaches, and support policy changes for macro- and microallocation strategies to proactively reduce the need for rationing.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed interrupted time series (ITS) analyses of sales volumes reported in standard units (i.e., doses), collected at regular monthly intervals from January 2018 to December 2020 and obtained from IQVIA, India. As children are less prone to develop symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we hypothesized a predominant increase in non-child-appropriate formulation (non-CAF) sales. COVID-19-attributable changes in the level and trend of monthly sales of total antibiotics, azithromycin, and HCQ were estimated, accounting for seasonality and lockdown period where appropriate. A total of 16,290 million doses of antibiotics were sold in India in 2020, which is slightly less than the amount in 2018 and 2019. However, the proportion of non-CAF antibiotics increased from 72.5% (95% CI: 71.8% to 73.1%) in 2019 to 76.8% (95% CI: 76.2% to 77.5%) in 2020. Our ITS analyses estimated that COVID-19 likely contributed to 216.4 million (95% CI: 68.0 to 364.8 million; P = 0.008) excess doses of non-CAF antibiotics and 38.0 million (95% CI: 26.4 to 49.2 million; P < 0.001) excess doses of non-CAF azithromycin (equivalent to a minimum of 6.2 million azithromycin treatment courses) between June and September 2020, i.e., until the peak of the first epidemic wave, after which a negative change in trend was identified. In March 2020, we estimated a COVID-19-attributable change in level of +11.1 million doses (95% CI: 9.2 to 13.0 million; P < 0.001) for HCQ sales, whereas a weak negative change in monthly trend was found for this drug. Study limitations include the lack of coverage of the public healthcare sector, the inability to distinguish antibiotic and HCQ sales in inpatient versus outpatient care, and the suboptimal number of pre- and post-epidemic data points, which could have prevented an accurate adjustment for seasonal trends despite the robustness of our statistical approaches. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in non-CAF antibiotic sales, and particularly azithromycin, occurred during the peak phase of the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in India, indicating the need for urgent antibiotic stewardship measures.","Sulis, Giorgia; Batomen, Brice; Kotwani, Anita; Pai, Madhukar; Gandra, Sumanth",PLoS Med,315,1

In some cases, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and FDG uptake on PET/CT can mimic cancer and lead to confounding imaging results. These cases where findings overlap with cancer pose a significant dilemma for diagnostic purposes, follow-up, and management leading to possible treatment delays, unnecessary repeat imaging and sampling, and patient anxiety.

The partial least square results for data processing reflect that service quality and collaboration quality are determinants of e-filing user satisfaction, while user intentions only influenced by collaboration quality. Overall, this study can support the model that the success rate of e-filing is determined by user intentions and user satisfaction, which is shown by the net benefits generated from using e-filing systems.

Evaluating the possible impact on the invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence associated with a decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination is important to advocate the PCV programs. Using a deterministic, dynamic transmission model, the differential incidence and burden of IPD in children younger than 5 years in Japan were estimated between the rapid vaccination recovery (January 2021) and the delayed vaccination recovery (April 2022) scenarios for the next 10 years. In our model, the IPD incidence was reduced from 11.9/100,000 in 2019 to 6.3/100,000 in 2020, caused by a reduced transmission rate due to the COVID-19 mitigation measures. Assuming a recovery in the transmission rate in 2022 April, the incidence of IPD was estimated to increase with maximal incidence of 12.1 and 13.1/100,000 children under 5 years in the rapid and the delayed vaccination recovery scenarios. The difference in the total IPD incidence between these two scenarios was primarily driven by vaccine serotypes IPD incidence. The difference of incidence was not observed between the two scenarios after 2025. The persistent decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination rates due to the impact of COVID-19 might lead to an increased IPD incidence and an incremental disease burden.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Comput Biol Med,315,16

The aim of this study was to explore the decision-making processes of continued paid home care support for dementia in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: Unpaid carers caring for a person living with dementia (PLWD) who were accessing paid home care before COVID-19 and residing in the UK were eligible to take part. Participants were interviewed over the phone and asked about their experiences of using paid home care services before and since COVID-19, and their decision-making processes of accessing paid home care since the outbreak and public health restrictions. RESULTS: Fifteen unpaid carers, who were also accessing paid care support for the PLWD before COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) Risk; (2) Making difficult choices and risk management; and (3) Implications for unpaid carers. Many unpaid carers decided to discontinue paid carers entering the home due to the risk of infection, resulting in unpaid carers having to pick up the care hours to support the person living with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report on the impact of COVID-19 on paid home care changes in dementia. Findings raise implications for providing better Personal Protective Equipment for paid carers, and to support unpaid carers better in their roles, with the pandemic likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Cannon, Jacqueline; Eley, Ruth; Tetlow, Hilary; Gaughan, Anna; Komuravelli, Aravind; Shenton, Justine; Rogers, Carol; Butchard, Sarah; Callaghan, Steve; Limbert, Stan; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Shaw, Lisa; Whittington, Rosie; Hughes, Mishca; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Geriatr,315,20

METHODS: We developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) among consecutively hospitalised adults with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were prospectively recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales. Candidate predictors that were specified a priori were considered for inclusion in the model on the basis of previous prognostic scores and emerging literature describing routinely measured biomarkers associated with COVID-19 prognosis. We used internal-external cross-validation to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across eight National Health Service (NHS) regions in the development cohort. We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London). FINDINGS: 74â944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31â924 (43·2%) of 73â948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome. In internal-external cross-validation in the development cohort of 66â705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions. In held-out data from London (n=8239), the model showed a similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0·77 [95% CI 0·76 to 0·78]; calibration-in-the-large 0·00 [-0·05 to 0·05]); calibration slope 0·96 [0·91 to 1·01]), and greater net benefit than any other reproducible prognostic model. INTERPRETATION: The 4C Deterioration model has strong potential for clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration and inform decision making among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

We have developed a quantitative consumer purchase model to assess the purchase intention of a consumer under the influence of panic using regression analysis. The model is developed based on multiple regression analysis and logistic regression analysis of a questionnaire survey, which was conducted with 300 respondents. This consumer decision making model is implemented in an agent-based simulation model, which can evaluate the purchase intention probability of a consumer, given the personal and situational factors.

Control strategy is the major section of robot that makes a robot self-stabilized and helps to control its position and thereby reducing the error. In this chapter, the control strategy and machine learning approach in robot are discussed. Control strategy discussed here helps to ensure the trajectory tracking by back stepping technique and by using sliding mode control (SMC). It helps to achieve the velocity convergence and balancing the robots. In SMC, there is presence of chattering, and other intelligent technique is also discussed to reduce this chattering phenomenon. Those intelligent techniques are adaptive neuro fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) and neuro-sliding mode control scheme. Also, machine learning (ML) which is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) is also discussed here.

Statins are widely prescribed medications with well-established benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Adherence to statins is influenced by development of side effects, especially muscle related. There is wide range of neuromuscular side effects associated with statin therapy. Documented neuromuscular side effects include asymptomatic elevation of muscle enzymes, mild-moderate myalgias and cramps, toxic and immune-mediated severe necrotizing myopathy, and rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. In addition, statins can lead to unmasking or triggering of underlying muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders.

Procalcitonin is classically used as a diagnostic marker in bacterial infections, but its role in predicting Covid-19 disease severity is emerging. We aimed to identify the association between procalcitonin and Covid-19 disease severity in a critical care setting and whether bacterial co-infection is implicated. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Covid-19 patients with procalcitonin concentrations measured in a critical care setting at our institution between February and September 2020. Laboratory markers including peak procalcitonin values and a range of bacterial culture results were analysed. Outcomes were the requirement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as well as inpatient mortality. RESULTS: In total, 60 patients were included; 68% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 45% died as inpatient. Univariate analysis identified higher peak procalcitonin concentrations significantly associated with both the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, P = 0.02) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.6, P = 0.03). Higher peak procalcitonin concentrations was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.4, P = 0.03). There was a significant positive correlation between increased peak procalcitonin concentrations and duration on invasive mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between peak procalcitonin concentrations of patients with positive and negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated procalcitonin concentrations in Covid-19 patients are associated with respiratory failure requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and inpatient mortality. This association may be independent of bacterial co-infection.","Heer, Randeep S; Mandal, Amit Kj; Kho, Jason; Szawarski, Piotr; Csabi, Peter; Grenshaw, Dawn; Walker, Ian Al; Missouris, Constantinos G",Ann Clin Biochem,315,19

Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74â¯µg/m3, Total Particle Count, 6.08â¯×â¯106/m3, and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08â¯CFU/m3. Small sized particles (</â¯=â¯0.5 µm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Siddhartha; John, Rakesh; Patel, Sandeep; Neradi, Deepak; Kishore, Kamal; Dhillon, Mandeep S",,315,12

However, true incidence of thromboembolic events is difficult to determine in the ICU setting. The aim of our study was to investigate the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission and assessing the utility of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to screen for and diagnose lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between April 22nd and May 26th, 2020 where all adult patients with the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia admitted to 8 ICUs of Montefiore Medical Center were included. POCUS exam was performed on all patients at day 1 of ICU admission and at day 7 and 14 after the first exam. RESULTS: The primary outcome was to study the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing ICU admission. A total of 107 patients were included. All patients got POCUS exam on day 1 in the ICU, 62% got day 7 and 41% got day 14 exam. POCUS diagnosed 17 lower extremity DVTs on day 1, 3 new on day 7 and 1 new on day 14. Forty patients developed 52 thromboembolic events, with the rate of 37.3%. We found a high 45-day cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events of 37% and a high 45-day cumulative incidence of lower and upper extremity DVT of 21% and 10% respectively. Twelve (30%) patients had failure of therapeutic anticoagulation. Occurrence of a thromboembolic event was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08, p value = .81). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 patients in ICU have a high cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events, but not associated with higher mortality.

A novel synthetic approach for the same is always a beneficial addition to the literature. Henceforth, for the first time, we report the formation of three new Pd(II) complexes through the Michael addition pathway. Three chromone-based thiosemicarbazone ligands (SVSL1-SVSL3) and Pd(II) complexes (1-3) were synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectroscopic tools. The Michael addition pathway for the formation of complexes was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Distorted square planar structure of complex 2 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complexes 1-3 were subjected to DNA- and BSA-binding studies. The complex with cyclohexyl substituent on the terminal N of thiosemicarbazone (3) showed the highest binding efficacy toward these biomolecules, which was further understood through molecular docking studies. The anticancer potential of these complexes was studied preliminarily by using MTT assay in cancer and normal cell lines along with the benchmark drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, and gemcitabine). It was found that complex 3 was highly toxic toward MDA-MB-231 and AsPC-1 cancer cells with IC50 values of 0.5 and 0.9 µM, respectively, and was more efficient than the standard drugs. The programmed cell death mechanism of the complexes in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was confirmed. Furthermore, the complexes induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway. Conveniently, all the complexes showed less toxicity (&#8805;50 µM) against MCF-10a normal cell line. Molecular docking studies were performed with VEGFR2, EGFR, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease to illustrate the binding efficiency of the complexes with these receptors. To our surprise, binding potential of the complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease was higher than that with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.","Haribabu, Jebiti; Srividya, Swaminathan; Mahendiran, Dharmasivam; Gayathri, Dasararaju; Venkatramu, Vemula; Bhuvanesh, Nattamai; Karvembu, Ramasamy",Inorg Chem,315,16

This study aims to assess the clinical presentation and delays in diagnosing acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We evaluated data of all adult patients who underwent an appendectomy at our hospital between June 1, 2019 and June 1, 2020. Demographic data, admission type to the emergency room, radiological findings, pathological findings, and hospitalization time were noted. Patients were divided into four groups of 3-month periods, pre (Groups 5, 4, 3, 2) and during the pandemic (Group 1). Hospitalization time and perforation status of each group were compared. The hospital admission type and their effect on perforation were also evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen patients were included; 135 patients were male, and 57 were female. The median age was 39 years. In Group 1 (pandemic period), 28.8% of patients were referred to us from pandemic hospitals. The median hospitalization time was 7.3 h before pandemics (Group 2-5), 5 h in the pandemic period (Group 1). Perforation rates were 27.8% in Group 1, 23.3% in Group 2, 16.3% in Group 3, 14.0% in Group 4, and 18.6% in Group 5 (0 = 0.58). There was no difference in the patients in Group 1 in the rate of perforated appendicitis in patients who were referred from other pandemic hospitals (29.4) and those admitted via our own emergency room (16.6%) (p = 0.27) during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: We did not observe any clear increase in the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis during the pandemic period, even in patients who were transferred from other hospitals.","Turanli, Sevim; Kiziltan, Gamze",World J Surg,315,21

Nearly one-third of the adult population is hypertensive worldwide, it is urgent to identify the factors that determine the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: 148 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) from a national cohort in China were included in this study, of whom 103 were discharged and 45 died in hospital. Multivariate regression showed higher odds of in-hospital death associated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) > 28 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-6.91) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 7 pg/ml (HR: 3.63, 95% CI:1.54-8.55) at admission. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP &#8805;140 mm Hg or diastolic BP &#8805;90 mm Hg for more than once (&#8805;2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (p = 0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.028), and renal injury (p = 0.005). A stricter BP control with the threshold of 130/80 mm Hg was associated with lower mortality. Treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and spironolactone, was associated with a lower rate of ICU admission compared to other types of anti-hypertensive medications (8 (22.9%) vs. 25 (43.1%), p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 could help clinicians to identify patients with fatal outcomes at an early stage, blood pressure control is associated with better clinical outcomes, and RAAS suppressors do not increase mortality and may decrease the need for ICU admission.","Wang, Tao; Tang, Ruidi; Ruan, Honglian; Chen, Ruchong; Zhang, Zili; Sang, Ling; Su, Xi; Yi, Shuting; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Liu, Chunli; Li, Jing; Hong, Cheng; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Shiyue",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),315,24

Multivariate logistic regression models stratified by ethnicity and sex describe the independent associations between obesity and multilevel socioeconomic factors after adjustment for age, other SEP measures at the individual, family and neighborhood levels, and health behaviors such as physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking. A positive relationship was observed between obesity and family income among African-American and Caribbean-Black men. Receipt of public assistance was a strongly associated factor for obesity in Caribbean-Black men and women. Among African-American women, inverse relationships were observed between obesity and education, occupation, and family income; residence within a neighborhood with a supermarket also decreased their odds of obesity. Residence in a neighborhood with a park decreased the odds of obesity only among African-American men, whereas residence in a neighborhood with a supermarket decreased the odds of obesity among Caribbean-Black men. The social patterning of obesity by individual, household, and neighborhood socioeconomic resources differs for African-American and Caribbean-Black men and women within these cross-sectional analyses; an appreciation of these differences may be a prerequisite for developing effective weight control interventions and policies for these two populations.","Barrington, Debbie S; James, Sherman A; Williams, David R",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),315,16

The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin with structural similarity to the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms. A minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/ diffuse alveolar damage. In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy. The purpose of this review is to (a) provide background context about the origins and course of the pandemic, (b) discuss the laboratory's role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, (c) summarize the current state of biomarker analysis in COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on markers derived from the hematology laboratory, (d) comment on the impact of COVID-19 on hematology laboratory safety, and (e) describe the impact the pandemic has had on organized national and international educational activities worldwide.","Frater, John L; Zini, Gina; d039,; Onofrio, Giuseppe; Rogers, Heesun J",Int J Lab Hematol,315,16

The current study was undertaken to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle-related behaviours: eating, physical activity and sleep behaviour. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional web-based survey. A validated questionnaire to assess the changes in lifestyle-related behaviour was administered on adults across India using a Google online survey platform. RESULTS: A total of 995 responses (58.5% male, mean age 33.3 years) were collected. An improvement in healthy meal consumption pattern and a restriction of unhealthy food items was observed, especially in the younger population (age <30 years). A reduction in physical activity coupled with an increase in daily screen time was found especially among men and in upper-socio-economic strata. Quarantine induced stress and anxiety showed an increase by a unit in nearly one-fourth of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 marginally improved the eating behaviour, yet one-third of participants gained weight as physical activity declined significantly coupled with an increase in screen and sitting time. Mental health was also adversely affected. A detailed understanding of these factors can help to develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during COVID-19.","Chopra, Sakshi; Ranjan, Piyush; Singh, Vishwajeet; Kumar, Suraj; Arora, Mehak; Hasan, Mohamed Shuaib; Kasiraj, Rhytha; Kaur, Divjyot; Vikram, Naval K; Malhotra, Anita; Kumari, Archana; Klanidhi, Kamal Bandhu; Baitha, Upendra",Diabetes Metab Syndr,315,12

Digital health interventions, that include modalities such as internet, smart phones, and monitoring sensors, may help increase rural residents' access to healthcare. While digital health interventions have become an increasingly popular intervention strategy to address obesity, research examining the use of technological tools for obesity management among rural Latino populations is limited. In this paper, we share our experience developing a culturally tailored, interactive health intervention using digital technologies for a family-oriented, weight management program in a rural, primarily Latino community. We describe the formative research that guided the development of the intervention, discuss the process of developing the intervention technologies including issues of privacy and data security, examine the results of a pilot study, and share lessons learned. Our experience can help others design user-centered digital health interventions to engage underserved populations in the uptake of healthy lifestyle and disease management skills.

However, the antibody-dependent stool antigen immunoassay bears many challenges. Therefore, we developed an antibody-independent biosensing platform. The core of this platform was a triple-module biosensor. The first module was Ca2+-doped superparamagnetic nanoparticles modified with an H. pylori-specific aptamer, functioning to selectively capture H. pylori cells from samples. The second module was a bifunctional co-polymer of chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron (III)-polyethylene glycol-desferrioxamine, which could bind to H. pylori with high affinity and chelate Fe3+ from the third module of Fe3+-quenched carbon dots (CDs) solution. When the formed module 1-H. pylori-module 2 complexes reacted with module 3, a subsequent magnetic separation could scavenge Fe3+, causing fluorescence recovery from quenched CDs as the transducing mechanism. This transducer could respond to tiny changes in Fe3+ concentration with distinguishable fluorescence differences, thus conferring the biosensor with high sensitivity, a wide detection range of 10-107 CFU/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 CFU/mL. From simulated human stool samples, H. pylori was enriched with a centrifugal microfluidic plate to eliminate any interference from matrices, and the bacteria were subjected to detection using the biosensor. The actual LOD for the biosensing platform coupling microfluidics and the biosensor was 101, and the total time taken was 65 min. This work showcases an instant, accurate, and ultra-sensitive diagnosis of H. pylori in feces.","Wang, Zhuangzhuang; Wang, Hongying; Cheng, Xiaohong; Geng, Jiayue; Wang, Lili; Dong, Quanjiang; Liu, Chenguang; Chi, Zhenming; Chi, Zhe",Biosens Bioelectron,315,23

However, it remains an outstanding open problem to develop numerical methods that are both (i) of a high order of accuracy and (ii) capable of preserving positivity. It is known that the two main families of numerical methods, Runge-Kutta methods and multistep methods, face an order barrier: if they preserve positivity, then they are constrained to low accuracy: they cannot be better than first order. We propose novel methods that overcome this barrier: our methods are of second order, and they are guaranteed to preserve positivity. Our methods apply to a large class of differential equations that have a special graph Laplacian structure, which we elucidate. The equations need be neither linear nor autonomous and the graph Laplacian need not be symmetric. This algebraic structure arises naturally in many important applications where positivity is required. We showcase our new methods on applications where standard high order methods fail to preserve positivity, including infectious diseases, Markov processes, master equations and chemical reactions.","Blanes, Sergio; Iserles, Arieh; Macnamara, Shev",,315,12

Much effort has been made to stop the virus from spreading, and there are currently no approved pharmaceutical products to treat COVID-19. Here, we apply an in silico approach to investigate more than 3800 FDA approved drugs on the viral RBD S1-ACE2 interface as a target. The compounds were investigated through flexible ligand docking, ADME property calculations and protein-ligand interaction maps. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also performed on eleven compounds to study the stability and the interactions of the protein-ligand complexes. The MD simulations show that bagrosin, chidamide, ebastine, indacaterol, regorafenib, salazosulfadimidine, silodosin and tasosartan are relatively stable near the C terminal domain (CTD1) of the S1 subunit of the viral S protein. The relative MMGBSA binding energies show that silodosin has the best binding to the target. The constant velocity steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations show that silodosin preferentially interacts with the RBD S1 and has potential to act as an interfering compound between viral spike-host ACE2 interactions.

Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. Interview data were analyzed by category analysis from the perspective of the existence, relatedness, and growth theory (ERG). Results: The existence needs were mainly reflected in health and security needs, whereas the relatedness needs consisted mainly of interpersonal needs, humanistic concern needs, and family needs; further, the growth needs were mainly reflected as a strong need for knowledge. Existence needs were the main needs during the epidemic, with health and security needs influencing each other. Humanistic concern needs were the most important of the relatedness needs; interpersonal and family needs were also growing. Conclusion: It is found that the existence, relatedness, and growth needs coexist in clinical nurses. It is helpful to take effective interventions to meet their needs if the needs of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients could be perceived well.","Yin, Xue; Zeng, Lingdan",,315,29

We aim to report outcomes for children with LD and LT enrolled in the NASPGHAN/SPLIT SARS-CoV2 registry. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21âyears (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, Pâ=â0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, Pâ=â0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT. Two LD patients had MIS-C alone and 1 patient died. Bivariable logistic-regression analysis found that patients with nonalcoholic fatty LD (NAFLD) (odds ratio [OR] 5.6, Pâ=â0.02) and LD (OR 6.1, Pâ=â0.01, vs LT) had higher odds of severe disease (PICU, vasopressor support, MV, renal replacement therapy or death). CONCLUSIONS: Although not directly comparable, LT recipients had lower odds of severe SARS-CoV2 infection (vs LD), despite immunosuppression burden. NAFLD patients reported to the registry had higher odds of severe SARS-CoV2 disease. Future controlled studies are needed to evaluate effective treatments and further stratify LD and LT patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","Kehar, Mohit; Ebel, Noelle H; Ng, Vicky L; Baquero, Jairo Eduardo Rivera; Leung, Daniel H; Slowik, Voytek; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Shah, Amit A; Arnon, Ronen; Miloh, Tamir; Gupta, Nitika; Mohammad, Saeed; Kogan-Liberman, Debora; Squires, James E; Sanchez, Maria Camila; Hildreth, Amber; Book, Linda; Chu, Christopher; Alrabadi, Leina; Azzam, Ruba; Chepuri, Bhavika; Elisofon, Scott; Falik, Rachel; Gallagher, Lisa; Kader, Howard; Mogul, Douglas; Mujawar, Quais; Namjoshi, Shweta S; Valentino, Pamela L; Vitola, Bernadette; Waheed, Nadia; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Lobritto, Steven; Martinez, Mercedes",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,315,26

In parallel, the infusion of research support accelerated the development of new spectroscopic methods. While these methods have significantly reduced the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on society when coupled with behavioral changes, they also lay the groundwork for a new generation of platform technologies.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first wave of the pandemic spread across district borders in England as a function of pre-crisis commute to work streams between districts. Crucially, the strength of this spatial contagion depends on the phase of the epidemic. In the first pre-lockdown phase, the spread of the virus across district borders is high. During the lockdown period, the cross-border spread of new infections slows down significantly. Spatial contagion increases again after the lockdown is eased but not statistically significantly so.","Laroze, Denise; Neumayer, Eric; Plümper, Thomas",Soc Sci Med,315,1

The degradation of isoproturon, being a typical phenylurea herbicide, has been studied much with advanced oxidation processes. However, little information on the detailed degradation mechanism from the theoretical level is available. In the present work, the degradation mechanisms of OH-initiated reactions of isoproturon were studied at the MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df, 2p)//MPWB1K/6-31+G(d, p) level. The calculation results display that H-atom abstraction, ·OH addition, and ·OH substitution pathways are found for ·OH and isoproturon reactions. For H-atom abstractions, the results show that aliphatic H atoms are more easily abstracted by ·OH than the aromatic H atoms, and the pathway R6 has the lowest energy barrier of 6.65 kcal mol-1, indicating that H in the -CH3 group attached to the N2 atom could be most favorably abstracted. Six pathways for ·OH addition to the six sites of the phenyl ring are identified with low energy barriers, which are in good accordance with the fact that the additions of ·OH to the phenyl ring were the important steps from experimental results. For ·OH substitution reactions, two pathways with high activation energies are found, and the corresponding products have been also detected from previous experimental studies, suggesting that the substitution reactions could also occur.","Ren, Xiaohua; Liu, Ruilong; Zhang, Shanshan; Zhang, Jinying",J Mol Model,315,16

However, bleeding risk is also significant, causing difficulty in initiating and adjusting anticoagulation therapy in case of suspected thrombi. Cardiac masses can be challenging to be identified properly in the context of this disease. The use of bedside contrast echocardiography (CE) can be of a great value in this situation decreasing procedure-related risk and allowing proper diagnosis and management of a cardiac mass. Cases summary: We present two cases who were admitted with severe COVID-19 infection. Both cases had additional risk factors for hypercoagulability. Un-enhanced echocardiography was performed and revealed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with a suspected RV mass. The use of bedside CE could confirm a RV thrombus in the first case and exclude it in the second case. Hence, anticoagulation therapy could be adjusted accordingly in both patients. Discussion: Coronavirus disease 2019 infection is associated with peripheral thrombo-embolism and cardiac thrombi. Given the critical condition of many patients affected by COVID-19, imaging for thrombo-embolic events is often restricted. With the use of bedside CE, cardiac masses may be correctly identified, aiding proper adjustment of anticoagulation therapy.","Botrous, C.; Bioh, G.; Patel, A.; Hampson, R.; Senior, R.",European Heart Journal - Case Reports,315,16

RT-PCR was used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal samples. Risk factors for household secondary attack rates (SAR) and hospitalization with COVID-19 were examined using chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression analyses. During the outbreak, 142 cases, 20 hospitalizations and 1 death were recorded, with a total of 2273 individuals tested. The risk of hospitalization was associated with age (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values (OR for a decrease in Ct values by 1: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07-1.31). Household SAR was estimated at 38.62% (95% CI: 32.50-45.01%). After the designation of an isolation facility for cases, household SAR declined from 74.42% to 31.03%. Household size was associated with the risk of infection (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.00-7.07). The presence of COVID-19 symptoms among index cases was correlated with higher transmission (OR: 23.68, 95% CI 2.21-253.74) in multivariate analysis, while age was found to be associated with SAR only in univariate analysis.

Hence, it has become critical for firms to develop strategies to cope with a highly dynamic environment. This paper aims to analyze how the impact of the scientific collaboration networks with URIs (universities and research institutes) on firm innovation performance is contingent on technological and market dynamics. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 174 Chinese firms in the new-energy vehicle industry during 2004-2015, the authors applied a random-effects negative binomial modeling approach to model these relationships. Findings A broad and strong scientific collaboration network promotes firm innovation network effects are contingent on technological and market dynamics. While technological dynamics strengthen the effect market dynamics weaken it due to the different purposes of collaboration for firms and URIs. Practical implications Firms should adjust the structure of scientific collaboration networks with URIs when facing different environments. The government should encourage firms to jointly research with diverse URIs and play an active role in stabilizing market environments. Originality/value This study contributes to the academic debate on university-industry scientific collaborations. Applying the temporary competitive advantage (TCA) framework, we provide nuances to the literature that studies the factors that condition the effects of networks. This study also adds to the research on firm scientific collaboration networks by measuring networks based on the coauthorship between firms and URIs.","Yang, J.; Zhang, J.; Zeng, D.

This pandemic continues to cause widespread personal suffering, along with severe pressure on medical and health care providers. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent prognosis are worsened in individuals who have preexisting comorbidities prior to infection by the virus. Individuals with obesity or overweight, insulin resistance, and diabetes typically have chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by increased levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome; this state predisposes to greater risk for infection along with more adverse outcomes.

In the absence of a safe and effective cure or vaccine during the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world implemented these social-isolation strategies and other NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. But, individual and public perception play a crucial role in the success of any social-isolation measure. Thus, in spite of governments' initiatives to use NPIs to combat COVID-19 in many countries around the world, individual choices rendered social-isolation unsuccessful in some of these countries. This resulted in huge outbreaks that imposed a substantial morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, economic, etc., toll on human lives. In particular, human choices pose serious challenges to public health strategic decision-making in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To unravel the impact of this behavioral response to social-isolation on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a model framework that integrates COVID-19 transmission dynamics with a multi-strategy evolutionary game approach of individual decision-making. We use this integrated framework to characterize the evolution of human choices in social-isolation as the disease progresses and public health control measures such as mandatory lockdowns are implemented. Analysis of the model illustrates that SD plays a major role in reducing the burden of the disease compared to SQ. Parameter estimation using COVID-19 incidence data, as well as different lockdown data sets from India, and scenario analysis involving a combination of Voluntary-Mandatory implementation of SQ and SD shows that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the type of isolation, and the time and period of implementation of the selected isolation measure during the outbreak.","Ngonghala, Calistus N; Goel, Palak; Kutor, Daniel; Bhattacharyya, Samit",J Theor Biol,315,5

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the western Uganda community on the proper use of face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was carried out from 1st July to 10th July 2020 among western Ugandans of consent age of 18 years and above. Data was analysed using Stata version 14.2. RESULTS: Among the respondents (n = 1114), the mean age was 30.7 (SD 11.1), 51% were males, 53.9% married and 43% had attained secondary education. Most participants (60.1%, n = 670) had satisfactory knowledge on the use of face masks and participants at a tertiary education level [AOR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.42-4.67; p = 0.002)] were likely to have satisfactory knowledge than participants who had not education. On attitude, most respondents (69.4%) were confident enough to correctly put on a face mask; 83.4% believed that a face mask can protect against COVID-19 and 75.9% of respondents had never shared their face mask. The majority of respondents (95.2%) agreed wearing face masks in public places was important to protect themselves against COVID-19; 60.3% reported washing their hands before wearing and after removing the face mask. Unfortunately, 51.5% reported removing the face mask if they needed to talk to someone. CONCLUSION: Despite the satisfactory knowledge, good attitude and practices, there is still much more to be done in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices among participants. Government, non-governmental organizations and civil society should improve sensitization of populations on how to behave with face masks while talking to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 among western Ugandans.","Sikakulya, Franck Katembo; Ssebuufu, Robinson; Mambo, Simon Binezero; Pius, Theophilus; Kabanyoro, Annet; Kamahoro, Elizabeth; Mulumba, Yusuf; Muhongya, Jean Kakule; Kyamanywa, Patrick",PLoS One,315,5

Common clinical manifestations of HLH are acute unremitting fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multiorgan failure. Due to a massive cytokine release, this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome. HPS has primary and acquired (secondary, reactive) forms. Its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and, therefore, is called familial HLH. Secondary HLH may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder, that is, secondary to a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune/autoinflammatory stimulus. This paper aims to review the pathogenesis and the clinical picture of HLH, and its severe complication, the cytokine storm, with a special emphasis on the developed classification criteria sets for rheumatologists, since COVID-19 infection has clinical symptoms resembling those of the common rheumatologic conditions and possibly triggers HLH. MED-LINE/Pubmed was searched from inception to April 2020, and the following terms were used for data searching: ""hemophagocytic syndrome"" OR ""macrophage activation syndrome"" OR ""hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", OR ""cytokine storm"". Finally, AND ""COVID-19"" was included in this algorithm. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and limited numbers of earlier key references were manually selected. Only full-text manuscripts, published in an English language peer-reviewed journal were included. Manuscript selection procedure and numbers are given in Fig. 2. Briefly, the database search with the following terms of ""Hemophagocytic syndrome"" OR ""Macrophage activation syndrome"" OR ""Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"" OR ""Cytokine storm"" yielded 6744 results from inception to April 2020. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and only limited numbers of earlier key references were selected, and this algorithm resulted in 3080 manuscripts. The addition of (AND ""COVID-19"") resulted in 115 publications of which 47 studies, together with four sections of an online book were used in the final review. No statistical method was used. HLH is triggered by genetic conditions, infections, malignancies, autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseases, and some drugs. In COVID-19 patients, secondary HLH and cytokine storm may be responsible for unexplained progressive fever, cytopenia, ARDS, neurological and renal impairment. Differentiation between the primary and secondary forms of HLH is utterly important, since primary form of HLH requires complicated treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Further studies addressing the performance of HScore and other recommendations in the classification of these patients is necessary.","Soy, Mehmet; Atagündüz, Pamir; Atagündüz, Isik; Sucak, Gülsan Türköz",Rheumatol.Int,315,24

Elderly patients with cardiac, pulmonary and metabolic comorbidities are more likely to develop the severe manifestations of COVID-19, which are observed in less than 5% of the pediatric patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to induce an immune impairment and dysregulation, finally resulting in the massive release of inflammatory mediators, strongly contributing to the pulmonary and systemic manifestations in COVID-19. In children, the immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 can also be responsible of a severe disease phenotype defined as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. As the immune system undergoes a complex process of maturation from birth to adult age, differences in the immune and inflammatory response could have a significant impact in determining the spectrum of severity of COVID-19. Indeed, children show a higher ability to respond to viral infections and a reduced baseline pro-inflammatory state compared with elderly patients. Age and comorbidities contribute to disease severity through immune-mediated mechanisms, since they are associated with a chronic increase of pro-inflammatory mediators, and cause an enhanced susceptibility to develop an immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also the expression of ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, varies with age, and is linked to the immune and inflammatory response through a complex, and not completely elucidated, network.

Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analyses for survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 10.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-99.23; p = 0.042) and disease severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.06-6.19; p < 0.001) revealed similar trends. Curve-fitting analyses indicated that patient computed tomography (CT) scores peaked on days 22 and 24. An initial decline in IL-6 levels on day 16 was followed by resurgence to a peak, nearly in tandem with the CT scores. Conclusion: Increased IL-6 level may be an independent risk factor for disease severity and in-hospital mortality and dynamic IL-6 changes may serve as a potential predictor for lung injury in Chinese COVID-19 patients. These findings may guide future treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Zeming; Li, Jinpeng; Chen, Danyang; Gao, Rongfen; Zeng, Wen; Chen, Sichao; Huang, Yihui; Huang, Jianglong; Long, Wei; Li, Man; Guo, Liang; Wang, Xinghuan; Wu, Xiaohui",Front Pharmacol,315,16

Based on the development of the infection numbers, this period was divided into two phases of similar size: March to May and June to September. A total of 4898 infection cases were reported. Upon comparison of the phases, there were particularly marked differences in hospitalization and mortality, age, and countries of infection site. In the first phase, elderly persons were particularly affected by high rates of hospitalization and mortality. In the second phase, the average age and hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly lower, and a particularly large proportion were associated with international travel activity. The evaluation of the outbreak documentation revealed a particular focus in private household settings.

Low vitamin D levels may also increase susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.MethodStandards were determined by local policies, RCPsych recommendations and NICE guidance. Data were collected retrospectively from electronic patient records and entered manually to a spreadsheet for analysis.Result67% of patients had vitamin D tested on admission to hospital. Of the patients that had their vitamin D level tested, 39% patients had their result recorded. 48% either had a low vitamin D level or required replacement. 6 of 12 patients with a documented low vitamin D level had the correct vitamin D treatment, according to NICE guidance.ConclusionOf 46 patient records, nearly half had a documented low vitamin D level or were on treatment. We would therefore suggest that vitamin D testing should form part of the routine admission bloods. It is an important opportunity to detect deficiency or insufficiency for a potentially vulnerable group of patients. Intervention is simple and effective.Results demonstrated room for improvement for vitamin D testing on admission to hospital, thus improving potential treatment and benefits for individual patients. The importance of recording blood results on to the electronic patient record was also highlighted.We raised awareness and provided further education to all junior doctors, with creative posters and informative communications. Following the implementation of these changes a re-audit of 40 patients showed 75% had vitamin D tested on admission or during and of these, 58% either had a low vitamin D level or required replacement. 7 of 9 patients with a documented low vitamin D level had the correct vitamin D treatment, according to NICE guidance. Within this closed loop audit, we have reported moderate improvement in the testing of vitamin D for patients on admission to hospital along with a significant improvement in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency, according to NICE guidance.","Davies, Emma Mountford Lucy",BJPsych Open,315,10

334969,334969,334969,Understanding Society at 10 Years,15.245855,6.3183527,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a global threat. Examples are influenza (H1N1) caused by the H1N1pdm09 virus in 2009, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Antiviral drugs and vaccines may be insufficient to prevent their spread. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The evidence summarised in this review does not include results from studies from the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL on 1 April 2020. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP on 16 March 2020. We conducted a backwards and forwards citation analysis on the newly included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of trials investigating physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protection, hand hygiene, face masks, and gargling) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. In previous versions of this review we also included observational studies. However, for this update, there were sufficient RCTs to address our study aims. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Three pairs of review authors independently extracted data using a standard template applied in previous versions of this review, but which was revised to reflect our focus on RCTs and cluster-RCTs for this update. We did not contact trialists for missing data due to the urgency in completing the review. We extracted data on adverse events (harms) associated with the interventions. MAIN RESULTS: We included 44 new RCTs and cluster-RCTs in this update, bringing the total number of randomised trials to 67. There were no included studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six ongoing studies were identified, of which three evaluating masks are being conducted concurrent with the COVID pandemic, and one is completed. Many studies were conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, but several studies were conducted during the global H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, and others in epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016. Thus, studies were conducted in the context of lower respiratory viral circulation and transmission compared to COVID-19. The included studies were conducted in heterogeneous settings, ranging from suburban schools to hospital wards in high-income countries; crowded inner city settings in low-income countries; and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country. Compliance with interventions was low in many studies. The risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster-RCTs was mostly high or unclear. Medical/surgical masks compared to no masks We included nine trials (of which eight were cluster-RCTs) comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the spread of viral respiratory illness (two trials with healthcare workers and seven in the community). There is low certainty evidence from nine trials (3507 participants) that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI) compared to not wearing a mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.18. There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants). Harms were rarely measured and poorly reported. Two studies during COVID-19 plan to recruit a total of 72,000 people. One evaluates medical/surgical masks (N = 6000) (published Annals of Internal Medicine, 18 Nov 2020), and one evaluates cloth masks (N = 66,000). N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks We pooled trials comparing N95/P2 respirators with medical/surgical masks (four in healthcare settings and one in a household setting). There is uncertainty over the effects of N95/P2 respirators when compared with medical/surgical masks on the outcomes of clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; very low-certainty evidence; 3 trials; 7779 participants) and ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence; 5 trials; 8407 participants). The evidence is limited by imprecision and heterogeneity for these subjective outcomes. The use of a N95/P2 respirator compared to a medical/surgical mask probably makes little or no difference for the objective and more precise outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; moderate-certainty evidence; 5 trials; 8407 participants). Restricting the pooling to healthcare workers made no difference to the overall findings. Harms were poorly measured and reported, but discomfort wearing medical/surgical masks or N95/P2 respirators was mentioned in several studies. One ongoing study recruiting 576 people compares N95/P2 respirators with medical surgical masks for healthcare workers during COVID-19. Hand hygiene compared to control Settings included schools, childcare centres, homes, and offices. In a comparison of hand hygiene interventions with control (no intervention), there was a 16% relative reduction in the number of people with ARIs in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86; 7 trials; 44,129 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), suggesting a probable benefit. When considering the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza, the estimates of effect for ILI (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13; 10 trials; 32,641 participants; low-certainty evidence) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials; 8332 participants; low-certainty evidence) suggest the intervention made little or no difference. We pooled all 16 trials (61,372 participants) for the composite outcome of ARI or ILI or influenza, with each study only contributing once and the most comprehensive outcome reported. The pooled data showed that hand hygiene may offer a benefit with an 11% relative reduction of respiratory illness (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.95; low-certainty evidence), but with high heterogeneity. Few trials measured and reported harms. There are two ongoing studies of handwashing interventions in 395 children outside of COVID-19. We identified one RCT on quarantine/physical distancing. Company employees in Japan were asked to stay at home if household members had ILI symptoms. Overall fewer people in the intervention group contracted influenza compared with workers in the control group (2.75% versus 3.18%; hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97). However, those who stayed at home with their infected family members were 2.17 times more likely to be infected. We found no RCTs on eye protection, gowns and gloves, or screening at entry ports. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low compliance with the interventions during the studies hamper drawing firm conclusions and generalising the findings to the current COVID-19 pandemic. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks. The low-moderate certainty of the evidence means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect. The pooled results of randomised trials did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks during seasonal influenza. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. Harms associated with physical interventions were under-investigated. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs addressing the effectiveness of many of these interventions in multiple settings and populations, especially in those most at risk of ARIs.","Jefferson, Tom; Del Mar, Chris B; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Al-Ansary, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada A; van Driel, Mieke L; Jones, Mark A; Thorning, Sarah; Beller, Elaine M; Clark, Justin; Hoffmann, Tammy C; Glasziou, Paul P; Conly, John M",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,315,24

Based on this theoretical framework, combined with the policies and measures formulated by the Chinese government in the process of COVID-19 prevention, this article evaluate the advantages and deficiencies of China's public health system construction in response to COVID-19. Results: The Chinese government ensured the adequate supply of health resources, improved people's ability to pay medical expenses, and adopted advanced public health propaganda methods based on the Internet to help people grasp the basic information and development trend of COVID-19 in the process of COVID-19 prevention. At the same time, the utilization efficiency of health resources was low in China, people's ability to pay for medical expenses was unequal, and the disclosure of virus information in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19 is not timely. Conclusions: Other countries can learn from the advantages of China's public health system construction and avoid China's deficiencies in the process of public health system construction, which will help them improve the efficiency of COVID-19 prevention.","Zhang, Pengfei",Front Public Health,315,1

Tubule repair involved the plasticity of mature tubule cells in a process of cell de-differentiation and re-differentiation, which displayed substantial similarities between mouse and man. In addition, in man we identified a peculiar tubule reparative response determining the expansion of progenitor-like cells marked by PROM1 and following a differentiation program characterized by the sequential activation of the WNT, NOTCH and HIPPO signaling pathways. Taken together, our analyses reveal cell state transitions and fundamental cellular hierarchies underlying kidney injury and repair in critically ill patients.","Legouis, David; Rinaldi, Anna; Arnoux, Gregoire; Verissimo, Thomas; Scotti-Gerber, Jennifer; Faivre, Anna; Schibler, Manuel; Rinaldi, Andrea; Naesens, Maarten; Koppitch, Kari; Pugin, Jérôme; McMahon, Andrew P; Moll, Solange; Seigneux, Sophie de; Cippà, Pietro E",,315,1

Currently there is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease. Methylene blue (MB, oxidized form, blue color) has been used in many different areas of clinical medicine, ranging from malaria to orthopedics. Leucomethylene Blue (reduced form of MB, colorless) may be applied for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the scientific evidences. In severe patients, there is a cytokine storm (hyperinflammation) and high oxidative stress (OS). Inflammation and OS has a mutual correlation and exacerbate each other. In human body, MB first induces OS through absorbing electron (like a free radical) from other molecules, if the body could counteract to this OS, then reduced MB decreases OS through other mechanisms. Reduced MB could prevent inflammation, propagation of the virus RNA, and also improves hypoxia through reducing methemoglobin. Therefore, to avoid the increment of OS, we suggest using Leucomethylene Blue through the following protocol: The IV cocktail contains 50 mg MB (1mg/kg, 50-kg weight), 1000-2000 mg vitamin C, 500-1000 mg N-Acetylcysteine (or glutathione or cysteine or a-lipoic acid) and 10-20 gr urea (optional) in 100 ml dextrose 5%.

This case was reported because of the long-time retention and noninvasive removal by endoscopy without sedation or complication. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old male patient with intermittent upper abdominal pain. DIAGNOSES: During upper-gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, a long-strip foreign body (Fb) was seen in the descending part of the duodenum. An upper-GI barium examination was performed, which revealed a linear Fb in the duodenum cavity. The Fb was >10-cm long. Combined with his history (the patient admitted swallowing a chopstick 10 years ago in a bet), the diagnosis of Fb in the duodenum was confirmed.

The secondary objective was to compare venous thromboembolism events and coagulation variables in patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation according to the pathogen. DESIGN: Retrospective observational analysis at a single center. SETTING: Tertiary referral university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy with an injected CT scan performed after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All of these patients experienced venous thromboembolism: 10 patients (76.9%) had isolated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, two patients (15.4%) had isolated pulmonary embolism, and one patient (7.7%) had both cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Eleven patients (84.6%) had cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A jugular associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in seven patients (53.8%), a femoral associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in 10 patients (76.9%), and six patients (46.2%) had both femoral and jugular cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A pulmonary embolism was found in three patients (23.1%). No patient had central venous catheter-related deep vein thrombosis. One patient had thrombotic occlusion of the centrifugal pump, and one had oxygenator thrombosis requiring circuit replacement. Three patients (23.1%) had significant bleeding. Three patients (23.1%) had laboratory-confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and all of them developed cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. These three patients had femoral cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, and two had an oxygenator or pump thrombosis. The mean activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was higher in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 group than in the influenza group and the community-acquired pneumonia group (1.91 vs 1.48 vs 1.53; p = 0.001), which was also found in regard to the percentage of patients with an activated partial thromboplastin time ratio greater than 1.8 (47.8% vs 20% vs 20.9%; p = 0.003) and the mean prothrombin ratio (86.3 vs 61.6 vs 67.1; p = 0.003). There was no difference in baseline characteristics or venous thromboembolism events.

However, the current 1-2 m physical distancing rule is based on the physics of droplet transport and could not directly translate into infection risk. We therefore revisit the 2-m physical distancing rule by developing an infection-risk-based model for human speaking. The key modeling framework components include viral load, droplets dispersion and evaporation, deposition efficiency, viral dose-response rate and infection risk. The results suggest that the one-size-fits-all 2-m physical distancing rule derived from the pure droplet-physics-based model is not applicable under some realistic indoor settings, and may rather increase transmission probability of diseases. Especially, in thermally stratified environments, the infection risk could exhibit multiple peaks for a long distance beyond 2 m. With Sobol's sensitivity analysis, most variance of the risk is found to be significantly attributable to the variability in temperature gradient, exposure time and breathing height difference. Our study suggests there is no such magic 2 m physical distancing rule for all environments, but it needs to be used alongside other strategies, such as using face cover, reducing exposure time, and controlling the thermal stratification of indoor environment.","Liu, Fan; Luo, Zhiwen; Li, Yuguo; Zheng, Xiaohong; Zhang, Chongyang; Qian, Hua",Environ Int,315,5

We aimed to describe ancillary findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT, to define their prevalence, and investigate their association with clinical data. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our CT chest cases with coupled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Patients with negative rt-PCR or without admission chest CT were excluded. Ancillary findings included: vessel enlargement, subpleural curvilinear lines, dependent subpleural atelectasis, centrilobular solid nodules, pleural and/or pericardial effusions, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Continuous data were expressed as median and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and tested by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Ancillary findings were represented by 106/252 (42.1%, 36.1 to 48.2) vessel enlargement, 50/252 (19.8%, 15.4 to 25.2) subpleural curvilinear lines, 26/252 (10.1%, 7.1 to 14.7) dependent subpleural atelectasis, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) pleural effusion, 15/252 (5.9%, 3.6 to 9.6) mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, 13/252 (5.2%, 3 to 8.6) centrilobular solid nodules, and 6/252 (2.4%, 1.1 to 5.1) pericardial effusion. Air space disease was more extensive in patients with vessel enlargement or centrilobular solid nodules (p < 0.001). Vessel enlargement was associated with longer history of fever (p = 0.035) and lower admission oxygen saturation (p = 0.014); dependent subpleural atelectasis with lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001) and higher respiratory rate (p < 0.001); mediastinal lymph nodes with shorter history of cough (p = 0.046); centrilobular solid nodules with lower prevalence of cough (p = 0.023), lower oxygen saturation (p < 0.001), and higher respiratory rate (p = 0.032), and pericardial effusion with shorter history of cough (p = 0.015). Ancillary findings associated with longer hospital stay were subpleural curvilinear lines (p = 0.02), whereas centrilobular solid nodules were associated with higher rate of intensive care unit admission (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Typical high-resolution CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are frequently associated with ancillary findings that variably associate with disease extent, clinical parameters, and disease severity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Ancillary findings might reflect the broad range of heterogeneous mechanisms in severe acute respiratory syndrome from viral pneumonia, and potentially help disease phenotyping.","Silva, Mario; Ledda, Roberta Eufrasia; Schiebler, Mark; Balbi, Maurizio; Sironi, Sandro; Milone, Francesca; Affanni, Paola; Milanese, Gianluca; Sverzellati, Nicola",Br J Radiol,315,16

Hemato-oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, requiring decisive recommendations on treatment and triage. The aim of this survey amongst experts on radiation therapy (RT) for lymphoma and leukemia is to delineate typical clinical scenarios and to provide counsel for high-quality care. METHODS: A multi-item questionnaire containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was developed in a peer-reviewed process and sent to members of the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance. Answers were assessed online and analyzed centrally. RESULTS: Omission of RT was only considered in a minority of cases if alternative treatment options were available. Hypofractionated regimens and reduced dosages may be used for indolent lymphoma and fractures due to multiple myeloma. Overall, there was a tendency to shorten RT rather than to postpone or omit it. Even in case of critical resource shortage, panelists agreed to start emergency RT for typical indications (intracranial pressure, spinal compression, superior vena cava syndrome) within 24â¯h. Possible criteria to consider for patient triage are the availability of (systemic) options, the underlying disease dynamic, and the treatment rationale (curative/palliative). CONCLUSION: RT for hemato-oncological patients receives high-priority and should be maintained even in later stages of the pandemic. Hypofractionation and shortened treatment schedules are feasible options for well-defined constellations, but have to be discussed in the clinical context.","Oertel, M; Elsayad, K; Engenhart-Cabillic, R; Reinartz, G; Baues, C; Schmidberger, H; Vordermark, D; Marnitz, S; Lukas, P; Ruebe, C; Engert, A; Lenz, G; Eich, H T",Strahlenther Onkol,315,16

Methods: An email survey combining short and open-ended questions was distributed to all 40 Korean school deans in May 2020. Thirty-seven deans out of 40 medical schools in Korea (92.5%) participated. Results: Most lectures moved online but students' assessments were delayed and later held onsite. Clinical rotations continued except for an average of 3-week suspension during the first COVID-19 wave. The deans' remarks on the positive influences far outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Although technological adaptations caused initial hardship, the experience gained through the use of various online learning systems led to attitudinal changes on the importance of adopting new technology and a tailored and student centric curriculum in medical education. Conclusion: The deans' perspective changes has shown the possibility of the deans' generation aligning more closely with the current Generation Z medical students. They projected further innovations in teaching and learning methods, especially applying flipped learning and highlighted the need to invest in faculty development so medical educators can be equipped and competent in diverse ICT (information and communications technology) learning platforms. Also, the need for advance preparations in medical education for future similar public health crises were stressed. Unprecedented changes brought by COVID-19 positively impacted Korean medical education in parts and the Korean deans envisioned further innovations using the experiences gained during this crisis.","Park, Hyunmi; Lee, Young-Mee; Ho, Ming-Jung; Han, Hee-Chul",Korean j. med. educ.

Despite the success of such initiatives in limiting the spread of COVID-19 to #FlattenTheCurve, physicians are now confronted with the adverse effects of the current restrictive pandemic management strategies and social distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: We aim to draw attention to the particular importance and magnitude of what may be the adverse effects of COVID-19-related policies. METHODS: We herein report a case of an otherwise healthy 84-year-old woman with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to COVID-19-related directives. #StayAtHome policies and consequential social isolation have diminished our patient's social life and reduced her healthy movement behaviors. The patient spent long hours in a seated position while focusing on the intensive flow of media information regarding the pandemic. RESULTS: Reduced mobility due to preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic was the only identified cause of the DVT. CONCLUSIONS: While evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmentally implemented containment measures, including social isolation and mobility reduction, adverse events should be considered. Digital approaches might play a crucial role in supporting public health.","Blum, Edna; Abdelwahed, Youssef S; Spiess, Eileen; Mueller-Werdan, Ursula; Leistner, David M; Rosada, Adrian",Interact J Med Res,315,16

To overcome the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the aquaculture and fisheries economy needs urgent recovery plans which this study focusses on using a mixed-method including online questionnaire surveys, face-to-face and telephonic interviews and focus group discussions during June – November 2020. This study reveals some positive impacts on ecosystem and fish stock (e.g., increase in fish stock) due to less disturbance of fishing activities, but that are not able to bring societal benefits as all the fisheries sub-sectors are affected differently by the pandemic. There are disrupted transportation systems and increased transportation costs (around 20 – 60% higher than normal), more input and maintenance costs and less demand for/and decreased market price of fish. There are also shortages of labourers and reduced patrolling to implement fishery regulations. Cancellation of orders by foreign buyers has seriously affected the shrimp and crab sub-sectors. The fisheries-dependent people’s capital assets and activities have been mostly negatively affected resulting in a worsened livelihood. This study has suggested a set of immediate and long-term changes to policy and action plans to recover this sector and sub-sectors from the pandemic considering economic, social and environmental sustainability. The findings of this study may have important implications not only for Bangladesh but also for other fisheries dependent developing countries with similar impacts by the virus like in South Asia.","Islam, Md Monirul Khan Makidul Islam Barman Aparna",Marine Policy,315,6

Similarly, sporadic reports of COVID-19 related extrapulmonary manifestations emerge. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive summary of the multiorgan manifestations of COVID-19, making it difficult for clinicians to quickly educate themselves about this highly contagious and deadly pathogen. What is more, is that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the closest humanity has come to combating something similar to COVID-19, however, there exists no comparison between the manifestations of any of these novel coronaviruses.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6, 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses. FINDINGS: 669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costs-including proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travel-were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated. CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and non-medical support for patients was particularly impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.","Khan, Mishal S; Rego, Sonia; Rajal, Joaquín Benítez; Bond, Virginia; Fatima, Razia Kaneez; Isani, Afshan Khurshid; Sutherland, Jayne; Kranzer, Katharina",PLoS One,315,13

The virus that causes COVID-19 was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several studies have reported chemosensory dysfunction, such as anosmia and ageusia, as common findings in COVID-19 positive patients. To date, qualitative olfactory testing has been performed only in a very few cohort studies on COVID-19 patients. However, objective testing is necessary to verify or determine the true magnitude of their deficits. Moreover, the proportion of COVID-19 patients exhibiting true olfactory disturbances is unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the true prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients by objective assessment in mild to moderate symptomatic patients. MATERIALS & METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective cross-sectional analytical study. All patients who were COVID-19 positive and having mild to moderate symptoms and not admitted in ICU formed part of the study group. Objective evaluation of smell function was done. RESULTS: Self-reported smell dysfunction was present in 26.9% patients (n=62) and taste dysfunction was seen in 10.9% (n=25) of patients. On quantitative assessment of smell dysfunction, it was noted that 41.3% (n=95) of patients had some form of smell dysfunction out of which 70.5% patients (n=67) had hyposmia and 29.5% patients (n=28) had anosmia.

That relationship was confirmed by a multivariate analysis showing the combined effect of the two pollutants, adjusted for the old-age index and population density. An increase in PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations by one unit (1 µg/m3) corresponded to an increase in incidence rates of 1.56 and 1.24 × 104 people, respectively, taking into account the average levels of air pollutants in the period 2016-2020, and 2.79 and 1.24 × 104 people during March-May 2020.

In Study 1, concrete misinformation primed psychological proximity which, in turn, increased perceived threat. Perceived threat then increased the likelihood that misinformation would be shared. Source credibility was also shown to positively influence misinformation sharing. Study 2 advanced this by showing this process was moderated by subjective knowledge.

We probed to what extent students were able to access their existing accommodations, to what extent the online environment required novel accommodations, and what factors prevented students from being properly accommodated in STEM courses. Using inductive coding, we identified that students were unable to access previously established accommodations, such as reduced-distraction testing and note-takers. We also found that the online learning environment presented novel challenges for students with disabilities that may have been lessened with the implementation of accommodations. Finally, we found that instructors making decisions about what accommodations were appropriate for students and disability resource centers neglecting to contact students after the transition to online instruction prevented students from receiving the accommodations that they required in STEM courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study illuminates current gaps in the support of students with disabilities and pinpoints ways to make online STEM learning environments more inclusive for students with disabilities.","Gin, Logan E; Guerrero, Frank A; Brownell, Sara E; Cooper, Katelyn M",CBE Life Sci Educ,315,19

No study has evaluated the relationship between VAP and mortality in this population, or compared this relationship between SARS-CoV-2 patients and other populations. The main objective of our study was to determine the relationship between VAP and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: Planned ancillary analysis of a multicenter retrospective European cohort. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. Univariable and multivariable marginal Cox's regression models, with cause-specific hazard for duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, were used to compare outcomes between study groups. Extubation, and ICU discharge alive were considered as events of interest, and mortality as competing event. FINDINGS: Of 1576 included patients, 568 were SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 482 influenza pneumonia, and 526 no evidence of viral infection at ICU admission. VAP was associated with significantly higher risk for 28-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.16-2.47), p = 0.006), and influenza groups (1.75 (1.03-3.02), p = 0.045), but not in the no viral infection group (1.07 (0.64-1.78), p = 0.79). VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation in the SARS-CoV-2 group, but not in the influenza or no viral infection groups. VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of ICU stay in the 3 study groups. No significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to VAP between the 3 groups, suggesting that the impact of VAP on mortality was not different between study groups. INTERPRETATION: VAP was associated with significantly increased 28-day mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, did not significantly modify the relationship between VAP and 28-day mortality. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04359693.","Nseir, Saad; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Povoa, Pedro; Metzelard, Matthieu; Du Cheyron, Damien; Lambiotte, Fabien; Tamion, Fabienne; Labruyere, Marie; Makris, Demosthenes; Boulle Geronimi, Claire; Pinetonde Chambrun, Marc; Nyunga, Martine; Pouly, Olivier; Mégarbane, Bruno; Saade, Anastasia; Gomà, Gemma; Magira, Eleni; Llitjos, Jean-François; Torres, Antoni; Ioannidou, Iliana; Pierre, Alexandre; Coelho, Luis; Reignier, Jean; Garot, Denis; Kreitmann, Louis; Baudel, Jean-Luc; Voiriot, Guillaume; Contou, Damien; Beurton, Alexandra; Asfar, Pierre; Boyer, Alexandre; Thille, Arnaud W; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Tsolaki, Vassiliki; Vinsonneau, Christophe; Floch, Pierre-Edouard; Le Guennec, Loïc; Ceccato, Adrian; Artigas, Antonio; Bouchereau, Mathilde; Labreuche, Julien; Duhamel, Alain; Rouzé, Anahita",Crit Care,315,16

Intensive real-time measurements were made to compare primary emissions and secondary aerosol formation in Xi'an, China before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Decreases in mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and its components were observed during the lockdown with reductions of 32-51%. The dominant contributor of PM was organic aerosol (OA), and results of a hybrid environmental receptor model indicated OA was composed of four primary OA (POA) factors (hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), and coal combustion OA (CCOA)) and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors (less-oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA)). The mass concentrations of OA factors decreased from before to during the lockdown over a range of 17% to 58%, and they were affected by control measures and secondary processes. Correlations of secondary aerosols/&#916;CO with Ox (NO2 + O3) and aerosol liquid water content indicated that photochemical oxidation had a greater effect on the formation of nitrate and two OOAs than sulfate; however, aqueous-phase reaction presented a more complex effect on secondary aerosols formation at different relative humidity condition. The formation efficiencies of secondary aerosols were enhanced during the lockdown as the increase of atmospheric oxidation capacity. Analyses of pollution episodes highlighted the importance of OA, especially the LO-OOA, for air pollution during the lockdown.","Tian, Jie; Wang, Qiyuan; Zhang, Yong; Yan, Mengyuan; Liu, Huikun; Zhang, Ningning; Ran, Weikang; Cao, Junji",Environ Int,315,16

For this reason, a freely available interactive program was developed for calculating, optimizing, plotting and comparing various diagnostic accuracy measures and the corresponding risk of diagnostic or screening tests measuring a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time in non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing prevalence of the disease, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold, standard measurement uncertainty of the tests and expected loss. The application of the program is illustrated with a case study of glucose measurements in diabetic and non-diabetic populations.

In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December. DATA AND METHODS: Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020. DISCUSSION: This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.","Rotermann, Michelle",Health Rep,315,1

AIM: To examine pregnant women's levels of stress, mental and physical health, and health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online, with recruitment and data collection occurring between 16/6/20 and 17/7/20. Participants were pregnant women recruited via online pregnancy/parenting communities. Participants self-reported their levels of general stress, pregnancy-specific stress and COVID-19 related stress, mental and physical health, general health behaviours, and COVID-19 related health behaviours. FINDINGS: 573 pregnant women participated in the survey. Participants were most commonly resident in the United States (42.6%, n=243), Ireland (41.2%, n=235) or the United Kingdom (10%, n=57). The majority (80.0%, n=457) were married and educated to degree level or above (79.3, n=453). Pregnant women reported high levels of pregnancy-specific and COVID-19-related stress, and low levels of mental and physical health, during the pandemic. Encouragingly, pregnant women in this study generally reported high levels of adherence to public health advice and pregnancy health behaviours. Stress and general mental health outcomes were best predicted by well-being factors (including stress and social support). Health impairing behaviours (e.g. poor diet) were predicted by both well-being and demographic factors. DISCUSSION: Interventions targeting pregnancy- and pandemic-specific stress at the population level will be essential to support mental health and minimise adverse outcomes for women and children during the pandemic.","Pope, Johanna; Olander, Ellinor K; Leitao, Sara; Meaney, Sarah; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen",Women and birth (Online),315,20

Since the study of Alzheimer, MNCD gained a great attention in clinical and research field, and nowadays it is considered a major public health priority, due to its prevalence and incidence all over the world: over 6% in people older than 65 years, with an increasing of prevalence each five years of age and with an even higher prevalence in developing countries [5]. International data showed an increasing prevalence of MNCD, mainly due to the relationship between constitutional/genetics factors [32,33,34], unhealthy habits [30,31] and negative environmental factors [35,36,37,38,39,40,41]. [...]the progressive ageing of the population has a central role in the increasing of prevalence, as the prevalence of MNCD is higher in higher ages [42].

METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. CONCLUSION: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities.","Lupia, Tommaso; Scabini, Silvia; Mornese Pinna, Simone; Di Perri, Giovanni; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Corcione, Silvia",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,315,20

Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes, and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based detection. SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple-organ pathogenic proinflammatory responses. Direct viral tissue damage is a transient phenomenon that is generally not sustained throughout disease progression.","El Jamal, Siraj M; Pujadas, Elisabet; Ramos, Irene; Bryce, Clare; Grimes, Zachary M; Amanat, Fatima; Tsankova, Nadejda M; Mussa, Zarmeen; Olson, Sara; Salem, Fadi; Miorin, Lisa; Aydillo, Teresa; Schotsaert, Michael; Albrecht, Randy A; Liu, Wen-Chun; Marjanovic, Nada; Francoeur, Nancy; Sebra, Robert; Sealfon, Stuart C; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Fowkes, Mary; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Westra, William H",Hum Pathol,315,16

Rescue PCI is generally thought to have worse outcomes than PPCI in STEMI. We aimed to determine short- and long-term outcomes of patients with rescue PCI versus PPCI for treatment of STEMI. Methods and results: Patients admitted with STEMI (excluding out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) within the Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) registry between 2005 and 2018 treated with either rescue PCI or PPCI were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. Comparison of 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and long-term mortality between the two groups was performed. There were 558 patients (7.1%) with rescue PCI and 7271 with PPCI. 30-day all-cause mortality (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 5%, p = 0.47) and MACE (rescue PCI 10.3% vs. PPCI 8.9%, p = 0.26) rates were similar between the two groups. Rates of in-hospital major bleeding (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 3.4%, p = 0.002) and 30-day stroke (rescue PCI 2.2% vs. PPCI 0.8%, p < 0.001) were higher following rescue PCI. The odds ratio for haemorrhagic stroke in the rescue PCI group was 10.3. Long-term mortality was not significantly different between the groups (rescue PCI 20% vs. PPCI 19%, p = 0.33). Conclusions: With contemporary interventional techniques and medical therapy, rescue PCI remains a valuable strategy for treating patients with failed fibrinolysis where PPCI is unavailable and it has been suggested in extenuating circumstances where alternative revascularisation strategies are considered.","Fernando, Himawan; Dinh, Diem; Duffy, Stephen J; Brennan, Angela; Sharma, Anand; Clark, David; Ajani, Andrew; Freeman, Melanie; Peter, Karlheinz; Stub, Dion; Hiew, Chin; Reid, Christopher M; Oqueli, Ernesto",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,315,16

Although most COVID-19 cases are mild, some are severe or critical, predominantly due to acute lung injury. It has been widely accepted that a counter regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis including the ACE2/ANG [1-7]/Mas protects the lungs from acute lung injury. However, recent evidence suggests that the generation of protective ANG [1-7] in the lungs is predominantly mediated by proinflammatory prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in lung pathology. This review contends that acute lung injury in severe COVID-19 is characterised by a) ACE2 downregulation and malfunction (inflammatory signalling) due to viral occupation, and b) dysregulation of the protective RAS axis, predominantly due to increased activity of proinflammatory POP. It follows that a reasonable treatment strategy in COVID-19-related acute lung injury would be delivering functional recombinant (r) ACE2 forms to trap the virus. Additionally, or alternatively to rACE2 delivery, the potential benefits resulting from lowering POP activity should also be explored. These treatment strategies deserve further investigation.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Starling, Randall C; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Butler, Javed; Boudoulas, Harisios",Heart Lung Circ,315,21

The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions on smoking habits using data collected within the Lost in Italy project. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 6003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years. Study subjects were recruited from 27 April to 3 May 2020 and were asked to report changes in smoking habits before the lockdown and at the time of interview. RESULTS: During the lockdown, 5.5% of the overall sample quit or reduced smoking, but 9.0% of the sample started, relapsed smoking or increased their smoking intensity. In total, the lockdown increased cigarette consumption by 9.1%. An improvement in smoking habits was associated with younger age, occasional smoking and unemployment, whereas a worsening was mainly associated with mental distress. In particular, an increase in cigarette consumption during lockdown was more frequently reported among those with worsening quality of life (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.80), reduction in sleep quantity (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.07) and increased anxiety (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.43) and depressive symptoms (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.71). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown had a huge impact on smoking consumption of the Italian general population. The main concern is for smokers who increase their cigarette consumption due to an increased mental distress. Providing greater resources for cessation services capable of reducing mental health symptoms in smokers is urgently needed.","Carreras, Giulia; Lugo, Alessandra; Stival, Chiara; Amerio, Andrea; Odone, Anna; Pacifici, Roberta; Gallus, Silvano; Gorini, Giuseppe",Tob. control,315,21

Docking analysis may be an important tool in the research for the development of more effective agents against specific drug targets or multitarget agents 1-3. METHODS: In the present study, based on docking analysis, ten tetrahydrothiazolo[2,3-a]isoindole derivatives were chosen for evaluation of antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: All compounds showed antibacterial activity against eight Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial species being in some cases, more potent than ampicillin and streptomycin against all species. The most sensitive bacteria appeared to be S. aureus, and En. cloacae while M. flavus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa were the most resistant ones. The compounds were also tested for their antifungal activity against eight fungal species. All compounds exhibited good antifungal activity better than reference drugs bifonazole (1.4 - 41 folds) and ketoconazole (1.1 - 406 folds) against all fungal species. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action docking studies on different antimicrobial targets were performed. CONCLUSION: According to docking analysis, the antifungal activity can be explained by the inhibition of the CYP51 enzyme for most of the compounds with better correlation of the results obtained for the P.v.c. strain (linear regression between estimated binding Energy and log(1/MIC) with R 2 =0.867 and p=0.000091 or R 2 = 0.924, p= 0.000036, when compound 3 is excluded.","Geronikaki, Athina; Kartsev, Victor; Eleftheriou, Phaedra; Petrou, Anthi; Glamoclija, Jasmina; Ciric, Anna; Sokovic, Marina",Curr. top. med. chem,315,24

As a network of early career professionals working in the area of addiction medicine, we provide our views with regards to national actions related to reducing alcohol-related harm and providing care for people with alcohol use disorder during COVID-19. We believe that COVID-19 related measures have affected alcohol consumption in the majority of countries represented in this commentary. Examples of these changes include changes in alcohol consumption patterns, increases in cases of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, disruptions in access to medical care for alcohol use disorder and increases in illegal production of alcohol. Our members urge that treatment for acute and severe conditions due to substance use should be considered as essential services in times of humanitarian crises like COVID-19.","Calvey, Tanya; Scheibein, Florian; Saad, Noha Ahmed; Shirasaka, Tomohiro; Dannatt, Lisa; Stowe, M J; Shah, Bigya; Narasimha, Venkata Lakshmi; Bruschi, Angelo; Peyron, Eric; Gumikiriza-Onoria, Joy Louise; Ghosh, Abhishek; Pant, Sagun Ballav; Yee, Anne; Ratta-Apha, Woraphat; Vadivel, Ramyadarshni; Siste, Kristiana; Maiti, Tanay; Boujraf, Saïd; Grandinetti, Paolo; Morgan, Nirvana; Arya, Sidharth",J Addict Med,315,24

In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, in the interviewed families, the simultaneous presence of adults and children at home has generally intensified. Families refer, on the whole, a positive and resilient behavior in the lockdown period, even if initial emotional problems are reported in one out of three children-adolescents. The ability to maintain a family organized structure seems to be partially compromised. Forced cohabitation leads to competition for the same resources of time and space and affects the entire family unit. The school institution emerges as a protective factor for children, young people and also for the well-being of families themselves.","Brunelli, Antonella; Silvestrini, Giulia; Palestini, Luigi; Vitali, Patrizia; Nanni, Rachele; Belluzzi, Antonio; Ciambra, Roberta; De Logu, Marcella; Degli Angeli, Mila; Dessì, Francesca Luisa; Donati, Daniela; Gaspari, Laura; Ghini, Teresa; Giovannini, Michela; Iaia, Maurizio; Mazzini, Franco; Mollace, Rocco; Nanni, Viridiana; Perra, Anna Pina; Poggioli, Barbara; Ponton, Ilaria; Russo, Giustina; Saletti, Annalena; Selli, Arrigo; Stazzoni, Antonella; Vignutelli, Lucia; Zamuner, Elena; Venturini, Lisa; Zamprogno, Enrico; Valletta, Enrico; Marchetti, Federico",Recenti Prog Med,315,20

MethodsWe drew data from the National Cancer Institutes 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). We described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, physical activity, mental health, alcohol use, patterns of social networking service use, and health information data sharing. Analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Multivariate models (multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and multinomial logistic model) were used to assess the sole and joint effect of sex and pandemic. In addition, we applied the Bonferroni correction to adjust p-values to decrease the risks of type I errors when making multiple statistical tests. ResultsWomen are more likely to use mobile health and health communication technologies. The effect of sex after the COVID-19 pandemic is significant on mental health, and women are more possible to have depression or anxiety disorders. The effect of sex is also significant before and after the pandemic regarding seeking health or medical information. Women have a smaller quantity and intensity of physical activity, which has a negative effect on health. ConclusionGender differences exist regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic amplifies the differences in some health and health care domains.

Detailed histopathological descriptions of COVID-19 chilblains have not been reported, and causality of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established. OBJECTIVES: To describe the histopathological features of COVID-19 chilblains and to explore the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue. METHODS: We examined skin biopsies from seven paediatric patients presenting with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all cases and electron microscopy in one. RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endotheliitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS-CoV-2. Endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 chilblains and perhaps also in a group of patients severely affected by COVID-19 presenting with features of microangiopathic damage. What is already known about this topic? Despite the high number of cases of chilblains seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, a definite causative role for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been proven. Different pathogenetic hypotheses have been proposed, including coagulation anomalies, interferon release and external factors. What does this study add? The demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells of skin biopsies by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirms that these lesions are part of the spectrum of COVID-19. Virus-induced vascular damage and secondary ischaemia could explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 chilblains. Our findings support the hypothesis that widespread endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 could have a pathogenetic role in the severe forms of COVID-19. Linked Comment: Wetter.

We compared two timeframes of 2020 (March 15-July 4 and July 5-October 31) to similar timeframes over the four prior years (2016-2019). RESULTS: In the early pandemic, March 15-July 4, a statistically significant decrease in relative search volume of the majority of queries (60%) was detected, with a significant increase in only 2 queries (i.e. myalgia and toe swelling). In the phase July through October, a statistically significant decrease was detected in only 22% of search queries; there was no difference for 60% of search queries between 2020 and 2016-2019 suggesting a return to their prior levels for most of search queries. Interestingly, the search volume of 18% of search queries (i.e. fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, myalgia, spondylosis, radiculopathy, myelopathy, neck pain, neck strain, lower back strain, sciatica, shoulder pain, frozen shoulder, elbow pain, lateral epicondylitis, wrist pain, carpal tunnel, hand pain, finger pain, trigger finger, and Morton's neuroma) was significantly increased compared with the four prior years. CONCLUSION: Public interest focused on COVID-19 and sought online information for COVID-19 symptoms in the early pandemic. In the period July through October, there was an upward trend in musculoskeletal symptoms and some colloquial terms/well-known musculoskeletal conditions coupled with a downward trend in general musculoskeletal disorder terms and certain specific diagnoses. This information may help rheumatologists understand public interest in musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders and address the needs of patients to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on outcomes.","Kardes, Sinan; Erdem, Anil; Gürdal, Hatice",Z. rheumatol,315,16

To address this problem, we developed a set of four multiplex mutation-specific PCR-based assays with same-day reporting that can detect five VOCs and three variants of interest (VOIs), as defined in the March 2021 guidelines from the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The screening results were compared to the whole genome sequencing (WGS) and showed 100% concordance for strain typing for B.1.1.7 (25) and P.1 (5) variants using Spike (S) mutations N501Y, E484K and H69_V70del assays. The S L450R assay, designed to detect the B.1.427/429 VOCs, also identified multiple isolates of a newly emerging multiply-mutated B.1.526.1 variant that is now rapidly increasing in the Eastern US. PCR approaches can be easily adopted in clinical laboratories, provide rapid screening methods to allow early detection of newly emergent variants and to efficiently triage cases for full genomic sequencing.","Wang, Huanyu; Jean, Sophonie; Eltringham, Richard; Madison, John; Snyder, Pamela; Tu, Huolin; Jones, Daniel M; Leber, Amy L",J. clin. microbiol,315,1

METHODS: We compared the number of outpatient department visits, the days of prescription from the outpatient department, the number of emergency department visits of the nursing home residents and staff, the number of admissions, and the days of admission of the residents for respiratory tract infection treatment between 2019 and 2020 to examine the effect of our preventive measures in the nursing home. Residents and staff who continuously lived and worked in the nursing home from 2019 to 2020 were included. The differences in outcomes between 2019 and 2020 were examined using paired sample t tests. The multivariate analyses were presented through generalized estimating equation analysis. RESULTS: A cohort of 183 residents and 127 staff was included and their electronic medical documentation was analyzed in two periods: January-September 2019 and January-September 2020. These residents had lower numbers of outpatient department visits (P < 0.001), days of prescription from the outpatient department (P < 0.001), number of emergency department visits (P < 0.001), number of admissions (P < 0.001), and days of admission (P < 0.001) to treat respiratory tract infections from January-September 2020 than January-September 2019. These staff members had lower numbers of outpatient department visits (P = 0.015) and days of prescription from the outpatient department (P = 0.009) to treat respiratory tract infections from January-September 2020 than January-September 2019. CONCLUSION: The association between our preventive measures and decreasing the risk of respiratory tract infection in nursing home residents and staff could be found. Sharing these experiences is valuable, as they provide important insights related to clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Chia-Yu; Kuo, Yu-Hung; Chuang, Shu-Ting; Yen, Hung-Rong; Tou, Sio-Ian",Eur Geriatr Med,315,6

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are ubiquitously expressed in cells. Endogenous miRNA may function as an innate response to block pathogen invasion. The miRNA expression profiles of both mice and humans after the ingestion of honeysuckle were obtained. Fifteen overexpressed miRNAs overlapped and were predicted to be capable of targeting three viruses: dengue virus (DENV), enterovirus 71 (EV71) and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, let-7a was examined to be capable of targeting the EV71 RNA genome by reporter assay and Western blotting. Moreover, honeysuckle-induced let-7a suppression of EV71 RNA and protein expression as well as viral replication were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that let-7a targeted EV71 at the predicted sequences using luciferase reporter plasmids as well as two infectious replicons (pMP4-y-5 and pTOPO-4643). The suppression of EV71 replication and viral load was demonstrated in two cell lines by luciferase activity, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, Western blotting and plaque assay. Furthermore, EV71-infected suckling mice fed honeysuckle extract or inoculated with let-7a showed decreased clinical scores and a prolonged survival time accompanied with decreased viral RNA, protein expression and virus titer. The ingestion of honeysuckle attenuates EV71 replication and related pathogenesis partially through the upregulation of let-7a expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our previous report and the current findings imply that both honeysuckle and upregulated let-7a can execute a suppressive function against the replication of DENV and EV71. Taken together, this evidence indicates that honeysuckle can induce the expression of let-7a and that this miRNA as well as 11 other miRNAs have great potential to prevent and suppress EV71 replication.","Lee, Ying-Ray; Chang, Chia-Ming; Yeh, Yuan-Chieh; Huang, Chi-Ying F; Lin, Feng-Mao; Huang, Juan-Ting; Hsieh, Chang-Chi; Wang, Jen-Ren; Liu, Hsiao-Sheng",Viruses,315,20

Data that examine all in-hospital complications of COVID-19 and that compare these complications with those associated with other viral respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, are lacking. To assess complications of COVID-19 and influenza, electronic health records (EHRs) from 3,948 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (March 1-May 31, 2020) and 5,453 hospitalized patients with influenza (October 1, 2018-February 1, 2020) from the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the United States,* were analyzed. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, complications in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were compared with those in patients with influenza. Risk ratios were calculated and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions; proportions of complications were stratified among patients with COVID-19 by race/ethnicity. Patients with COVID-19 had almost 19 times the risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than did patients with influenza, (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 18.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.40-28.00), and more than twice the risk for myocarditis (2.56; 1.17-5.59), deep vein thrombosis (2.81; 2.04-3.87), pulmonary embolism (2.10; 1.53-2.89), intracranial hemorrhage (2.85; 1.35-6.03), acute hepatitis/liver failure (3.13; 1.92-5.10), bacteremia (2.46; 1.91-3.18), and pressure ulcers (2.65; 2.14-3.27). The risks for exacerbations of asthma (0.27; 0.16-0.44) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0.37; 0.32-0.42) were lower among patients with COVID-19 than among those with influenza. The percentage of COVID-19 patients who died while hospitalized (21.0%) was more than five times that of influenza patients (3.8%), and the duration of hospitalization was almost three times longer for COVID-19 patients. Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, and sepsis was higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) patients, patients of other races, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) patients compared with those in non-Hispanic White (White) patients, even after adjusting for age and underlying medical conditions. These findings highlight the higher risk for most complications associated with COVID-19 compared with influenza and might aid clinicians and researchers in recognizing, monitoring, and managing the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations. The higher risk for certain complications among racial and ethnic minority patients provides further evidence that certain racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19 and that this disparity is not solely accounted for by age and underlying medical conditions.","Cates, Jordan; Lucero-Obusan, Cynthia; Dahl, Rebecca M; Schirmer, Patricia; Garg, Shikha; Oda, Gina; Hall, Aron J; Langley, Gayle; Havers, Fiona P; Holodniy, Mark; Cardemil, Cristina V",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,315,20

Fifty-four student teachers and 24 teacher educators responded to open-ended questionnaires, and 16 semi-structured interviews with teacher educators were analysed based on grounded theory. Results demonstrate that our student teachers struggle substantially with VUCA circumstances and do not seem to receive sufficient preparation in the domain of social-emotional competencies.

Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants' attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%). These younger individuals want to protect their families and their relatives (96.7%); they see vaccination as an act of civic responsibility (91.9%) and express strong confidence in their healthcare providers (87.7%). Another critical factor is the younger population's fear of personal COVID-19 infection (88.2%); moreover, the greater the number of children the participants have, the greater is their intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

Of particular note is the striking case of the wallowing US beset by multiple “market failures” all along its medical supply chain and an absence of state capacity. Such historic conjunctures have tested the apparatuses of social reproduction: they can force profound restructuring, altering the path of accumulation along with the underlying societal order.

In Qatar, the situation is dire with reports there is one psychiatrist per 170,000 people in the population. A one-day, student-led mental-health conference was held in Doha, Qatar under the auspices of the World Psychiatric Association with the aim of increasing interest in psychiatry as a career. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this single-arm, pre-post comparison study, a questionnaire assessing interest in psychiatry as a career was administered on participants before and after attending the conference. Demographic information was obtained and response items were on a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test with a significant p-value set at <0.05. RESULTS: The conference was attended by 102 individuals. Fifty-four attendees completed the pre-conference survey (53% response rate) and 36 participants completed the post-conference survey (35% response rate). Data for the 36 matched pre-post responses were included in our analyses. The average age of respondents was 22 years and 81% were female. There was improvement in post-conference results however these changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first intervention study on increasing interest in psychiatry as a career carried out in Qatar. It is likely that psychiatry enthusiasts attended the conference and therefore their interest in this medical specialty was already high as corroborated by the favorable pre-conference survey results. This might explain why there was a lack of statistical significance in comparison to post- intervention scores. We recommend that such an event be integrated into the medical school curricula throughout Qatar to include students with low baseline interest in psychiatry. Further research in this area with more robust methodology is urgently needed to help narrow the pervasive treatment gap.","Hankir, Ahmed; Tom, Abdallah; Ibrahim, Hania; Rifai, Aicha Hind; Shahwar, Durre; Azeem, Muhammad Waqar; Javed, Afzal; Imam, Zainab Kikelomo; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatr Danub,315,26

However, far less is known about such a link during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly based on nationally representative samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine this association among middle-aged/older adults. Methods/Design Data were taken from the short survey of the German Ageing Survey (June/July 2020, 3134 individuals in the analytical sample). The De Jong Gierveld scale was used to quantify loneliness, the Satisfaction with Life Scale was used to quantify life satisfaction and the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression was used to quantify depressive symptoms. Results Regressions showed that?compared to daily users?less frequent users of the internet for contact with friends and relatives reported increased loneliness, lower life satisfaction and more depressive symptoms. With regard to covariates, better psychosocial factors were associated with medium education (compared to low education), living with partner in the same household (compared to singles), better self-rated health, and favourable COVID-19 factors (in terms of decreased feeling that the Corona crisis is a threat for oneself, not having an infection with the coronavirus and an increased feeling that you can influence an infection with the coronavirus yourself). Conclusions Data suggest that individuals with a high frequency of contact with friends and relatives via internet reported better psychosocial factors.

In this research note, we present findings from an original dataset that features mobility restrictions in all EU/EFTA states as well as the United Kingdom during the first wave of the pandemic. We find that most countries adopted restrictions within a few days only and that restrictions on internal mobility had been introduced prior to restrictions on cross-border mobility, but that the latter have been more persistent. Furthermore, we observe an evolution from great variation of policy choices at the outset of the pandemic towards convergence. Analyzing the mobility restrictions through a policy diffusion lens, we find tentative evidence for interdependent policy-making especially in the temporal patterns of adoption.

A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. Here we compare serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using binding and functional assays. We show weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we find evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS: Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy. Actually, some concern has been expressed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and their serious consequences for mothers and their offspring. However, many aspects remain to be clarified.","Brillo, Eleonora; Tosto, Valentina; Gerli, Sandro; Buonomo, Ersilia",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,315,30

Like all industrial sectors, the aviation sector must implement measures to reduce its climate impact. This paper focuses on the simulation and the evaluation of climatic scenarios for the aviation industry. For this purpose, a specific tool (CAST for""Climate and Aviation - Sustainable Trajectories"") has been developed. This tool follows a methodology adapted to aviation using the concept of carbon budget and models of the main levers of action such as the level of air traffic, reduction of aircraft energy consumption or energy decarbonisation. These models are based on trend projections from historical data or assumptions from the literature. Several scenario analyses are performed in this paper using CAST and allow several conclusions to be drawn. For instance, the modelling of the scenarios based on the ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) commitments shows that aviation would consume between 2.9% and 3.5% of the world carbon budget to limit global warming to 2{\deg}C and between 6.5% and 8.1% for 1.5{\deg}C. Also, some illustrative scenarios are proposed. By allocating 2.6% of the carbon budget to aviation, it is shown that air transport is compatible with a +2{\deg}C trajectory when the annual growth rate of air traffic varies between -1.8% and +2.6%, depending on the considered technological improvements. However, in the case of a +1.5{\deg}C trajectory, the growth rate would have to be reduced drastically. Finally, analyses including non-CO2 effects compel to emphasize the implementation of specific strategies for mitigating contrails.","Planes, Thomas; Delbecq, Scott; Pommier-Budinger, Val'erie; B'enard, Emmanuel",,315,19

Our analysis reveals a large degree of geographic heterogeneity in the distribution of the types of third places, which is highly correlated with baseline demographics and county characteristics. Certain types of pages like""Places of Worship""demonstrate a large degree of clustering suggesting community preference or potential complementarities to concentration. We also found that the social networks of different types of social place differ in important ways: The social networks of 'Restaurants' and 'Indoor Recreation' pages are more likely to be tight-knit communities of pre-existing friendships whereas 'Places of Worship' and 'Community Amenities' page categories are more likely to bridge new friendship ties.

Risk factors, such as age, gender, and obesity, were associated with COVID-19 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to use several host receptors for viral entry, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) in the lung and other organs. However, ACE2 could be shed from the surface to be soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in the circulation. The epigenetic factors affecting ACE2 expression include a type of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we aimed at exploring the status of the sACE2 as well as serum levels of several upstream novel miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers that might have a potential role in T2DM patients. Serum samples were collected from 50 T2DM patients and 50 healthy controls, and sACE2 levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Also, RNA was extracted, and TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure serum miRNA levels. Our results revealed that sACE2 is decreased in the T2DM patients and is affected by age, gender, and obesity level. Additionally, 4 miRNAs, which are revealed by in silico analysis to be potentially upstream of ACE2 were detectable in the serum. Among them, miR-421 level was found to be decreased in the serum of diabetic patients, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetic complications, as well as being differential in various body mass index (BMI) groups. The other 3 miRNAs (miR-3909, miR-212-5p, and miR-4677-3p) showed associations with multiple factors including age, gender, BMI, and serum markers, in addition to being correlated to each other. In conclusion, our study reveals a decline in the circulating serum levels of sACE2 in T2DM patients and identified 4 novel miRNAs that were associated with T2DM, which are influenced by different clinical and demographic factors.","Elemam, Noha Mousaad; Hasswan, Hind; Aljaibeji, Hayat; Sulaiman, Nabil",Int. j. mol. sci.

Basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Reason for denial, country of origin, and month of importation were all examined to determine which countries of origin resulted in the largest number of denials, and whether there was a seasonal change in importations during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). During 2020, CDC denied entry to 458 dogs. This represents a 52% increase in dogs denied entry compared to the averages in 2018 and 2019. Dogs were primarily denied entry for falsified rabies vaccination certificates (56%). Three countries exported 74% of all dogs denied entry into the United States, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed for certain countries. Increased attempts to import inadequately vaccinated dogs from countries with canine rabies in 2020 may have been due to the increased demand for domestic pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational messaging should highlight the risk of rabies and the importance of making informed pet purchases from foreign entities to protect pet owners, their families, and the public.","Pieracci, Emily G; Williams, Cara; Wallace, Ryan M; Kalapura, Cheryl; Brown, Clive M",,315,20

The disease produced by this virus, called Covid-19, presents with variable clinical manifestations, from practically asymptomatic patients with catarrhal processes to severe pneumonias that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In recent weeks, papers have been published describing coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications in these patients, mainly among those admitted to intensive care units. The infection triggers an immune response, which causes different inflammatory mediators to be released into the blood. These include cytokines, which interact with platelets and different coagulation proteins, and promote thrombogenesis. One of the most widely studied coagulation markers in Covid-19 is D-dimer (DD), raised levels of which have prognostic implications, although the best cut-off point for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this population has not been clarified, nor has its usefulness in determining the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required in these patients. Until sufficiently robust information (preferably from well-designed clinical trials) is available, the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines for the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTE should be followed in Covid-19 patients.","López-Reyes, Raquel; Oscullo, Grace; Jiménez, David; Cano, Irene; García-Ortega, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

Although epigenetic regulation including miR-21-3p associated with autophagy process has been reported in many cancer types, nevertheless, the mechanism of miR-21-3p in bovine ovary is poorly understood. In the present study, bovine ovarian granulosa cells (BGCs) were used as a model to elucidate the autophagy and role of miR-21-3p in a cattle ovary. The results from gene expression and tagged autophagosomes showed the autophagy in BGCs and miR-21-3p was identified as an important miRNA regulating autophagy of BGCs. The current results indicated that FGF2 was a validated target of miR-21-3p in autophagy regulation of BGCs according to the results from FGF2 luciferase reporter assays and FGF2 overexpression (oe-FGF2) or small interference (si-FGF2). Transfection of miR-21-3p mimic and si-FGF2 plasmids resulted in decreasing phosphorylated AKT and mTOR, while transfection of miR-21-3p inhibitor and oe-FGF2 increased the phosphorylated level of AKT and mTOR in BGCs. These data indicate that regulation of miR-21-3p on BGCs autophagy through AKT/mTOR pathway. In summary, this study suggests that miR-21-3p targets FGF2 to inhibit BGCs autophagy by repressing AKT/mTOR signaling.","Ma, Lizhu; Tang, Xiaorong; Guo, Shun; Liang, Mingyue; Zhang, Bin; Jiang, Zhongliang",Theriogenology,315,29

409908,409908,409908,Herd Immunity to COVID-19,15.140189,6.413447,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.","Ferguson, Neil M; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Walters, Caroline E.; Fu, Han; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cucunuba, Zulma; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra C; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Siveroni, Igor; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walker, Patrick G T; Wang, Yuanrong; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A; Riley, Steven",Wellcome Open Res.,315,20

Severe asthma is more susceptible to virus-induced asthma exacerbations, especially in the presence of high IgE levels. In the course of immune responses to viruses, an initial activation of innate immunity typically occurs and the production of type I and III interferons is essential in the control of viral spread. However, the Th2 inflammatory environment still appears to be protective against viral infections in general and in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections as well. As for now, literature data, although extremely limited and preliminary, show that severe asthma patients treated with biologics don't have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression to severe forms compared to the non-asthmatic population. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, exerts a profound cellular effect, which can stabilize the effector cells, and is becoming much more efficient from the point of view of innate immunity in contrasting respiratory viral infections. In addition to the antiviral effect, clinical efficacy and safety of this biological allow a great improvement in the management of asthma.","Menzella, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Galeone, Carla; Capobelli, Silvia; Scelfo, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",,315,16

Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity.","Ban, Bhupal; Sharma, Maya; Shetty, Jagathpala",,315,26

Prevalence of GDM differs by country/region due to ethnicity, lifestyle and diagnostic criteria. We compared GDM rates and risk factors in two Asian cohorts using the 1999 WHO and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. METHODS: The Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort are prospective birth cohorts. Information on sociodemographic characteristics and medical history were collected from interviewer-administered questionnaires. Participants underwent a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. Logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS: Using the 1999 WHO criteria, the prevalence of GDM was higher in GUSTO (20.8%) compared to SBC (16.6%) (p = 0.046). Family history of hypertension and alcohol consumption were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC than in GUSTO cohort while obesity was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO. Using the IADPSG criteria, the prevalence of GDM was 14.3% in SBC versus 12.0% in GUSTO. A history of GDM was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO than in SBC, while being overweight, alcohol consumption and family history of diabetes were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC. CONCLUSIONS: We observed several differential risk factors of GDM among ethnic Chinese women living in Shanghai and Singapore. These findings might be due to heterogeneity of GDM reflected in diagnostic criteria as well as in unmeasured genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors.","Loo, Evelyn Xiu Ling; Zhang, Yuqing; Yap, Qai Ven; Yu, Guoqi; Soh, Shu E; Loy, See Ling; Lau, Hui Xing; Chan, Shiao-Yng; Shek, Lynette Pei-Chi; Luo, Zhong-Cheng; Yap, Fabian Kok Peng; Tan, Kok Hian; Chong, Yap Seng; Zhang, Jun; Eriksson, Johan Gunnar",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,315,23

The consequence of that has been a heightened level of anxiety among humans and opting for unorthodox consumption behaviors as consumers. In this study the attempt was to analyze human behaviors during the ongoing pandemic process from the perspective of psychology and marketing fields of science. In so doing, interrelation among anxiety, which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has been explored. Based on these interrelations, a structural model was suggested. Findings of the research indicated that anxiety has high effect on the helpless approach dimension, which is one of the coping styles with stress; and that helpless approach alone has an effect on compulsive buying behavior. Besides, another objective of the study was to evaluate the mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty between coping style with stress and compulsive buying behavior. That analysis evidenced that intolerance of uncertainty in such an interrelation had a partial mediating effect.","Çelik, Samet; Köse, Gözde Güsan",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,315,24

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

This complex pathway is only poorly understood in context of immune regulation but critical to control infection. This study examines SARS-CoV2 infection and epithelial mechanisms of the kinin-kallikrein system at the kinin B2 receptor level in SARS-CoV-2 infection that is of direct translational relevance. MethodsFrom acute SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and -negative controls, transcriptomes of nasal brushings were analyzed. Primary airway epithelial cells (NHBEs) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with the approved B2R antagonist icatibant. SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-qPCR, cytotoxicity assays, plaque assays and transcriptome analyses were performed. The treatment effect was further studied in a murine airway inflammation model in vivo. ResultsHere, we report a broad and strong upregulation of kallikreins and the kinin B2 receptor (B2R) in the nasal mucosa of acutely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. A B2R antagonist impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread in NHBEs, as determined in plaque assays on Vero E6 cells. B2R antagonism reduced the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in vitro and in a murine airway inflammation model in vivo. In addition, it suppressed gene expression broadly, particularly genes involved in G-protein-coupled-receptor signaling and ion transport. ConclusionsIn summary, this study provides evidence that treatment with B2R antagonists protects airway epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its replication and spread, through the reduction of ACE2 levels and the interference with several cellular signaling processes. Future clinical studies need to shed light on the airway protection potential of approved B2R antagonists, like icatibant, in the treatment of early-stage COVID-19.","Jakwerth, Constanze A.; Feuerherd, Martin; Guerth, Ferdinand M.; Oelsner, Madlen; Schellhammer, Linda; Giglberger, Johanna; Pechtold, Lisa; Jerin, Claudia; Kugler, Luisa; Mogler, Carolin; Haller, Bernhard; Erb, Anna; Wollenberg, Barbara; Spinner, Christoph D.; Buch, Thorsten; Protzer, Ulrike; Schmidt-Weber, Carsten B.; Zissler, Ulrich M.; Chaker, Adam M.",,315,16

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of children 1 month to 21 years admitted March 14 to May 2, 2020, to 9 New York City pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: Of 70 children admitted to PICUs, median age was 15 (IQR 9, 19) years; 61.4% male; 38.6% Hispanic; 32.9% black; and 74.3% with comorbidities. Fever (72.9%) and cough (71.4%) were the common presenting symptoms. Twelve patients (17%) met severe sepsis criteria; 14 (20%) required vasopressor support; 21 (30%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 9 (12.9%) met acute kidney injury criteria; 1 (1.4%) required renal-replacement therapy, and 2 (2.8%) had cardiac arrest. For treatment, 27 (38.6%) patients received hydroxychloroquine; 13 (18.6%) remdesivir; 23 (32.9%) corticosteroids; 3 (4.3%) tocilizumab; and 1 (1.4%) anakinra; no patient was given immunoglobulin or convalescent plasma.

That is why scaling up COVID-19 testing is strongly recommended. However, depending on the time tests are performed, they may have a high rate of false-negative results. This inaccuracy of COVID-19 testing is a challenge against controlling the pandemic. Therefore, in this paper we propose a geometric classification algorithm that is fault -tolerant to handle the inaccuracy of tests. So, in a metropolis of n people, let w r be the number of cases that are tested, where r is the number of positive, while w is the number of negative COVID-19 cases, and k is an upper bound on the number of false -negative COVID-19 cases. The proposed algorithm takes 0(r "" (log r log w) w3 w logfitrO) time for isolating all positive cases together with at most k (according to the rate of error of testing) possibly positive (false -negative) cases from the rest of the people. The term hR in the time complexity is the size of convex hull of the set of positive cases, and obviously k E 0(w). For simplicity of this isolation, we consider a simple convex shape (a triangle) for this classification algorithm.","Sheikhi, F.; Alipour, S.; Ieee,","2021 26th International Computer Conference, Computer Society of Iran",315,24

AIM: The present study aimed to analyze the impact of lockdown on the monitoring and care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a Moroccan population from the Doukkala region. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study including 121 T2DM patients recruited from the Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment Center of El Jadida city. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data of our T2DM patients were recorded before and after lockdown that lasted 82 days. All patients have signed an informed consent after being informed about the purely scientific aims of the study. RESULTS: Our sample involved 84 women and 37 men with an age average of 57.31 ± 0.91 years. The effects of lockdown were more marked in women than in men: women showed a significant tendency to gain weight (from 78.13 ± 1.36 kg to 81.80 ± 1.45 kg; p-value < 0.000), that impacted the body mass index (p-value < 0.000); they also showed significant increases in HbA1c values (p-value = 0.001), significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.0302) and a surprising increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-value = 0.0132). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the women sample increased from 46.4% to 54.8% after the lockdown. In men, the negative effect of lockdown was observed only in HbA1c that values increased significantly from 8.66 ± 0.21% to 9.51 ± 0.25% (p-value = 0.0127). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that lockdown had impacted negatively the health status of T2DM patients, especially women. We suggest an urgent development of programs aiming to improve the hygiene of life and to reduce the impact of future crises on patients suffering chronic diseases such as T2DM.","Farhane, Hamid; Motrane, Majida; Anaibar, Fatima-Ezzahra; Motrane, Aïcha; Abeid, Said Nassor; Harich, Nourdin",Prim. care diabetes,315,1

Aerobic exercise such as running is known to provide metabolic benefits, but how the overconsumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) and exercise interact is not well characterized at the molecular level. Here, we examined the plasma proteome in mice for the effects of aerobic exercise as both a treatment and as a preventative regimen for animals on either a HFD or a healthy control diet. This analysis detected large changes in the plasma proteome induced by the HFD, such as increased abundance of SERPINA7, ALDOB, and downregulation of SERPINA1E and complement factor D (CFD; adipsin). Some of these changes were significantly reverted using exercise as a preventative measure but not as a treatment regimen. To determine if either the intensity or duration of exercise influenced the outcome, we compared high-intensity interval training and endurance running. Endurance running slightly outperformed high-intensity interval training exercise, but overall, both provided similar reversion in abundance of plasma proteins modulated by the HFD, including SERPINA7, apolipoprotein E, SERPINA1E, and CFD. Finally, we compared the changes induced by overconsumption of a HFD with previous data from mice fed on an isocaloric high-saturated fatty acid or polyunsaturated fatty acid diet. This identified several common changes, including not only increased apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E but also highlighted changes specific for overconsumption of a HFD (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, SERPINA7, and CFD), saturated fatty acid-based diets (SERPINA1E), or polyunsaturated fatty acid-based diets (haptoglobin). Together, these data highlight the importance of early intervention with exercise to revert HFD-induced phenotypes and suggest some of the molecular mechanisms leading to the changes in the plasma proteome generated by HFD consumption. Web-based interactive visualizations are provided for this dataset (larancelab.com/hfd-exercise), which give insight into diet and exercise phenotypic interactions on the plasma proteome.","Martinez-Huenchullan, Sergio F; Shipsey, Isaac; Hatchwell, Luke; Min, Danqing; Twigg, Stephen M; Larance, Mark",Mol Cell Proteomics,315,19

METHOD: Retrospective comparative study, based in a quaternary private hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, involving 193 adult patients hospitalized for mild and moderate COVID-19 related ARSD, analyzing treatment efficacy based on clinical and biochemical outcomes. RESULTS: The active group comprised 101 (52.3%) patients using hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin and the control group 92 (47.7%) patients who did not take these medications. Median age was 59 (47-70) in the active group and 65 (47-77) in the control group (pâ¯<â¯0.05). Patients in the control group had greater extent of pulmonary involvement on baseline chest CT scans (pâ¯<â¯0.05).

I can then link this information to repeated information on their children’s school performance, for a sample of over 300 students. Using individual fixed effects, the estimates show a negative and significant decrease on average grades of around 15% of a standard deviation after father’s job loss. These results are mainly driven by those students whose fathers suffer long unemployment spells. In contrast, the average impact of mother’s job loss on school performance is close to zero and non-significant. The decline in school performance during the Great Recession after father’s job loss, particularly among disadvantaged students, could result in detrimental long-term effects that might contribute to increased inequality.

The web portal is named ODT (Origin-Destination-Time) Flow Explorer. At the core of the explorer is an ODT data cube coupled with a big data computing cluster to efficiently manage, query, and aggregate billions of OD flows at different spatial and temporal scales. Although the explorer is still in its early developing stage, the rapidly generated mobility flow data can benefit a wide range of domains that need timely access to the fine-grained human mobility records. The ODT Flow Explorer can be accessed via http://gis.cas.sc.edu/GeoAnalytics/od.html.","Li, Zhenlong; Huang, Xiao; Ye, Xinyue; Li, Xiaoming",,315,1

A pilot study,15.144436,6.6776547,2021,"Grand environmental and societal challenges have drawn increasing attention to system innovation and socio-technical transitions. A recent Deep Transitions framework has provided a comprehensive theory of the co-evolutionary patterns of multiple socio-technical systems over the last 250 years. However, so far the framework has not been subjected to systematic empirical exploration. In this paper we address this gap by exploring the co-evolutionary model linking niche-level dynamics, transitions in single systems and 'great surges of development', as conceptualized by Schot and Kanger (2018) [1]. For this purpose, we conduct a case study on the historical evolution of mass production in the Transatlantic region from 1765 to 1972. Instead of focusing on dominant technologies or common practices the development of mass production is understood as the emergence of a meta-regime, i.e. a set of mutually aligned rules guiding production activities in multiple socio-technical systems. The results broadly confirm the overall model but also enable to extend the Deep Transitions framework by uncovering new mechanisms and patterns in the variation, diffusion and contestation of meta-regimes.","Kanger, Laur; Sillak, Silver",Technol Soc,315,16

There are still no approved drugs or vaccines. Dietary supplements could possibly improve the patient's recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), present an anti-inflammatory effect that could ameliorate some patients need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. EPA and DHA replace arachidonic acid (ARA) in the phospholipid membranes. When oxidized by enzymes, EPA and DHA contribute to the synthesis of less inflammatory eicosanoids and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins, maresins and protectins. This reduces inflammation. In contrast, some studies have reported that EPA and DHA can make cell membranes more susceptible to non-enzymatic oxidation mediated by reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of potentially toxic oxidation products and increasing the oxidative stress. Although the inflammatory resolution improved by EPA and DHA could contribute to the recovery of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation cannot be recommended before randomized and controlled trials are carried out.","Rogero, Marcelo M; Leão, Matheus de C; Santana, Tamires M; Pimentel, Mariana V de M B; Carlini, Giovanna C G; da Silveira, Tayse F F; Gonçalves, Renata C; Castro, Inar A",Free Radic Biol Med,315,16

OBJECTIVES: Develop and refine a basic dataset to enable standardized documentation of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) interventions delivered in a controlled clinical trial intended to improve voluntary motor function. SETTING: International Expert Working Group. METHODS: An international working group with expertise in spinal cord injury, PT, OT, and measurement developed a draft of the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Physical Therapy-Occupational Therapy (PT-OT) Basic Data Set (BDS). Emphasis was placed on efficiency and practicality of use. The BDS was iteratively refined based on applicable literature, and feedback collected from presentations at the 2017 and 2019 International Spinal Cord Society meetings. RESULTS: The ISCI PT-OT BDS contains seven broad categories of interventions: bed/seated mobility, standing activities, walking/stairs, gross motor upper extremity, fine motor upper extremity, strength training, and endurance training. The first five categories are classified as activity-directed and the last two as impairment-directed interventions. Time spent on interventions per category is recorded in 15-min intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The ISCI PT-OT BDS enables standardized documentation of PT-OT activity-directed or impairment-directed interventions.

In particular, male-specific out-migration has been a sustained tradition from the hill districts of Uttarakhand. The people have been migrating not just for seeking diverse avenues of employment, but also for accessing better educational and health opportunities. As per 2011 Census, the overall population growth rate in the state was 1.7% with huge differentials in the hill and plain districts. Hill districts witnessed one-fourth growth (0.7%) of the population compared to that of plain districts (2.8%) suggestive of huge out-migration from these (hill) districts of the state. The important thing to note is that the nature and patterns of out-migration have now paved the way from long-term to permanent out-migration. Also, the lack of employment opportunities is creating distress out-migration to destinations within or outside the state, which has become a major cause of concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the most short-term migrants who returned to their villages in desperation resulting in despondency and distress. In this context, the paper explores the factors of distress migration by analysing the data from a quick survey of 323 return migrants carried out in June 2020 to understand their employment and livelihood profile, reasons for their return to native places, coping mechanism and future plans. The findings reveal that due to lack of livelihood opportunities in their place of origin, most of them would eventually like to return to their destination places in the future to eke out their living. From a policy point of view, enhancing the economic base and livelihood opportunities by focusing on niche activities with improved provisioning of educational and health infrastructure and services can eventually help restrict out-migration from Uttarakhand.","Awasthi, Ishwar; Mehta, Balwant Singh",Indian J Labour Econ,315,16
430592,430592,430592,COVID-19 Therapeutic Options Under Investigation,15.494386,6.6387854,2020,"BACKGROUND: Stigma is the deleterious, structural force that devalues members of groups that hold undesirable characteristics. Since stigma is created and reinforced by society-through in-person and online social interactions-referencing the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" has the potential to create and perpetuate stigma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if there was an increase in the prevalence and frequency of the phrases ""Chinese virus"" and ""China virus"" on Twitter after the March 16, 2020, US presidential reference of this term. METHODS: Using the Sysomos software (Sysomos, Inc), we extracted tweets from the United States using a list of keywords that were derivatives of ""Chinese virus."" We compared tweets at the national and state levels posted between March 9 and March 15 (preperiod) with those posted between March 19 and March 25 (postperiod). We used Stata 16 (StataCorp) for quantitative analysis, and Python (Python Software Foundation) to plot a state-level heat map. RESULTS: A total of 16,535 ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" tweets were identified in the preperiod, and 177,327 tweets were identified in the postperiod, illustrating a nearly ten-fold increase at the national level. All 50 states witnessed an increase in the number of tweets exclusively mentioning ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" instead of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or coronavirus. On average, 0.38 tweets referencing ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" were posted per 10,000 people at the state level in the preperiod, and 4.08 of these stigmatizing tweets were posted in the postperiod, also indicating a ten-fold increase. The 5 states with the highest number of postperiod ""Chinese virus"" tweets were Pennsylvania (n=5249), New York (n=11,754), Florida (n=13,070), Texas (n=14,861), and California (n=19,442). Adjusting for population size, the 5 states with the highest prevalence of postperiod ""Chinese virus"" tweets were Arizona (5.85), New York (6.04), Florida (6.09), Nevada (7.72), and Wyoming (8.76).

Our brief critical discussion is focused on the multiple roles of the NO signaling pathways in the maintenance of basal physiological states of readiness in diverse cell types mediating innate immunological functions and in the facilitation of proinflammatory-mediated adaptive immunological responses associated with viral infections. Prior studies have reinforced the critical importance of constitutive NO signaling pathways in the homeostatic maintenance of the vascular endothelium, and state-dependent changes in innate immunological responses have been associated with a functional override of NO-mediated inhibitory tone. Accordingly, convergent lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of NO signaling pathways, as well as canonical oxidative effects of inducible NO, may provide a permissive cellular environment for viral entry and replication. In immunologically compromised individuals, functional override and chronic rundown of inhibitory NO signaling systems promote aberrant expression of unregulated proinflammatory pathways resulting in widespread metabolic insufficiencies and structural damage to autonomous cellular and organ structures. We contend that restoration of normative NO tone via combined pharmaceutical, dietary, or complex behavioral interventions may partially reverse deleterious physiological conditions brought about by viral infection linked to unregulated adaptive immune responses.","Stefano, George B; Esch, Tobias; Kream, Richard M",Med Sci Monit,315,15

Sustaining such services depends on maintaining provider profitability and reduced cost to consumers while continuing to support autonomy and independence for customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers (here crowdsourced drivers). This paper investigates the possible enactment of curbside regulations that limit the number of drivers simultaneously waiting at restaurants to pick up meals for delivery on both public safety and delivery efficiency. Curbside regulations would aim to increase safety by enabling social distancing between delivery personnel at pickup locations and have a secondary benefit of improving local traffic flows, which are sometimes impeded in busier, urban locations. Curbside space limits are studied in terms of their impacts on consumer-related performance measures: freshness of the food upon delivery and click-to-door time. This investigation is enabled through a proposed hybrid discrete-event and time-advanced simulation platform that replicates meal delivery service calls and pickup and delivery operations across a region built on data from a leading meal delivery company. Embedded within the simulation is an integer program that optimally assigns orders to drivers in a dynamically changing environment. Order assignments are constrained by imposed curbside capacity limits at the restaurants, and potential efficiencies and curbside violation reductions from bundling orders are assessed. Results of analyses from numerical experiments provide insights to state and local communities in designing curbside restrictions that reduce curbside crowding yet enable delivery companies to retain their profitability.","Fotouhi, Hossein Mori Nicholas Miller-Hooks Elise Sokolov Vadim Sahasrabudhe Sagar Transportation Research Board",,315,1

The objective of this study was to characterize the landscape of monthly prescription fill limit policies in Medicaid programs and their potential implications for expanding naloxone use for opioid overdose harm reduction. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multi-modal online and telephonic data collection strategy was used to identify and describe the presence and characteristics of monthly prescription fill limit policies across state Medicaid programs. Contextual characteristics were described regarding each state's Medicaid enrollment, opioid prescribing rates, and overdose death rates. Data collection and analysis occurred between February and May 2020. RESULTS: Medicaid-covered naloxone fills are currently subject to monthly prescription fill limit policies in 10 state Medicaid programs, which cover 20 % of the Medicaid population nationwide. Seven of these programs are located in states ranking in the top 10 highest per-capita opioid prescribing rates in the country. However, 8 of these programs are located in states with opioid overdose death rates below the national average. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of opioid overdose living in states with monthly prescription fill limits may experience significant barriers to obtaining naloxone. Exempting naloxone from Medicaid prescription limit restrictions may help spur broader adoption of naloxone for opioid overdose mortality prevention, especially in states with high opioid prescribing rates. Achieving unfettered naloxone coverage in Medicaid is critical as opioid overdoses and Medicaid enrollment increase amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Roberts, Andrew W; Look, Kevin A; Trull, Grace; Carpenter, Delesha M",Drug Alcohol Depend,315,16

However, other organs including the central nervous system (CNS) could be affected by the virus. Strokes, seizures, change in mental status, and encephalitis have been reported as the neurological manifestation of the disease. We hypothesized that COVID-19 could predispose younger patients to spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The present study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 has any relationship with the occurrence of spontaneous ICH in young or not. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all the patients with spontaneous ICH who were referred to our center between 20 Feb and 1 Sep 2020. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory test data were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups. The COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative ones. All the variables including age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume and location, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, the length of hospital stay, the lab test results and the clinical outcome at last visit or discharge as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were 22 COVID-19 positive patients (20.8%) and 84 COVID-19 negative ones (79.2%). The mean age of the patients in the case group (54.27 ± 4.67) was significantly lower than that in the control group (69.88 ± 4.47) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, our results showed a significant difference between the two groups based on the presence of chronic arterial hypertension (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups based on gender, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume, need for surgery, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, platelet count, Prothrombin Time (PT), and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (p > 0.05).

Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. METHOD: The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health - these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.","Araújo, Francisco Jonathan de Oliveira; de Lima, Ligia Samara Abrantes; Cidade, Pedro Ivo Martins; Nobre, Camila Bezerra; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Psychiatry Res,315,16

The most severe form of the disease presents with fever and shortness of breath, which rapidly deteriorates to respiratory failure and acute lung injury (ALI). COVID-19 also presents with a severe coagulopathy with a high rate of venous thromboembiolism. In addition, autopsy studies have revealed co-localized thrombosis and inflammation, which is the signature of thromboinflammation, within the pulmonary capillary vasculature. While the majority of published data is on adult patients, there are parallels to pediatric patients. In our experience as a COVID-19 epicenter, children and young adults do develop both the coagulopathy and the ALI of COVID-19. This review will discuss COVID-19 ALI from a hematological perspective with discussion of the distinct aspects of coagulation that are apparent in COVID-19. Current and potential interventions targeting the multiple thromboinflammatory mechanisms will be discussed.","Mitchell, William Beau",Paediatr Respir Rev,315,16

Apremilast is a recently approved drug, belonging to the small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, whose optimal safety and efficacy profile is somewhat affected by slow activity rate in clinical trials. Real world case series are suggesting a more consistent improvement, and with this additional personal investigation on 48 patients, we signal that 58% of patients achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 50, and 19% PASI 75 improvement in the first 8 weeks of treatment. Results at 16-week are remarkable, with overall 55% of patients achieving PASI 75, 21% PASI 90 and 14% PASI 100. Only 8 patients (18, 6%) had slightly improved, although satisfied with the regimen, and determined to continue. Noteworthy, our population was rather problematic in terms of comorbidities (86%), and resistance to other treatments, with only 28% naïve to systemics, including biologics.

This systematic review of the literature (SRL) is relevant to recognizing the characteristics of the educational processes in self-managing chronic diseases in contexts where technology did not play a significant role. Following the PRISMA protocol, the authors independently reviewed full-text articles from several databases using the following criteria: (1) intervention studies evaluating the effects of self-management health programs; (2) educational process of disease self-management; (3) studies that included at least one control group, and (4) peer-reviewed studies. In addition, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network measurement tool was used to assess the risk of bias in each trial. In the final sample, 38 articles were included. The findings regarding health education methods of self-care, using community-based care and technological tools, are considered fundamental. Among the conclusions, the relevance of the pedagogy that health education processes demand improvement in post-pandemic program effectiveness stands out.","Ruiz-Ramírez, Jessica Alejandra; Olarte-Arias, Yury Arenis; Glasserman-Morales, Leonardo David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),315,27

DESIGN: Prospective systematic postmortem surveillance study. SETTING: Zambia's largest tertiary care referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Deceased people of all ages at the University Teaching Hospital morgue in Lusaka, Zambia, enrolled within 48 hours of death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs were tested via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Deaths were stratified by covis-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors. RESULTS: 372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of <40 and in 70/364 (19.2%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with covid-19 (51/70; 73%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, six were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested before death. Covid-19 was identified in seven children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with covid-19 increased with age, but 76% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The five most common comorbidities among people who died with covid-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31%), hypertension (19; 27%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23%), alcohol misuse (12; 17%), and diabetes (9; 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, deaths with covid-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of covid-19. Therefore, cases of covid-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done not because covid-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of covid-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.","Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Gill, Christopher J; MacLeod, William; Kwenda, Geoffrey; Pieciak, Rachel; Mupila, Zachariah; Lapidot, Rotem; Mupeta, Francis; Forman, Leah; Ziko, Luunga; Etter, Lauren; Thea, Donald",BMJ,315,16

Twelve percent of SARS-CoV-2-infected children had viral co-infection with one or more common respiratory viruses. This was significantly more frequent than among their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts (0%; p=0.028). Compared to the same period the previous year, common respiratory viruses were less frequently detected (12% vs 73%, p<0.001).Conclusion: Despite partial lockdown with school and daycare closure, and consequently similar exposure to common viruses between children and adults, SARS-CoV-2-infected children had more frequent viral respiratory co-infections than their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts. Circulation of common respiratory viruses was less frequent during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak when compared to the same period last year, showing the impact of partial lockdown on the circulation of common viruses.

Methods: To analyze the behavior of mountain hiking users, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the data which had been collected in the app Tranggle. The main target are users in their 20s and 30s who visited the mountains in the metropolitan area in 2019-2020. Among them, we have selected data on the top 13 mountains based on the frequency of visits. After data pre-processing, mountain usage patterns were analyzed through statistical analysis and visualization. Results: Compared to 2019, the number of users in 2020 increased 1.36 times. The utilization rate of the well-established hiking trails has also increased. The usage of mountain on weekends (Saturday &gt; Sunday) was still the highest, and the difference in the usage between the days of the week decreased. Outside of work hours, early morning usage has increased and night-time usage has decreased. There was no significant change in usages depending on activity type, level (experience point) and exercise properties. Conclusion: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the usage of mountains has been changing towards low user density and short-distance trip. in the post-COVID-19 era, the function and role of forests in daily life are expected to increase.

This paper proposes to use sentiment analysis to extract useful information from multiple textual data sources and a blending ensemble deep learning model to predict future stock movement. The blending ensemble model contains two levels. The first level contains two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), one Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) and one Gated Recurrent Units network (GRU), followed by a fully connected neural network as the second level model. The RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models can effectively capture the time-series events in the input data, and the fully connected neural network is used to ensemble several individual prediction results to further improve the prediction accuracy. The purpose of this work is to explain our design philosophy and show that ensemble deep learning technologies can truly predict future stock price trends more effectively and can better assist investors in making the right investment decision than other traditional methods.","Li, Yang; Pan, Yi",,315,20

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of race/ethnicity in SARS-CoV-2 testing, infection, and outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study (1 February 2020 to 31 May 2020). SETTING: Integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. PARTICIPANTS: Adult health plan members. MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, neighborhood deprivation index, comorbid conditions, acute physiology indices, and race/ethnicity; SARS-CoV-2 testing and incidence of positive test results; and hospitalization, illness severity, and mortality. RESULTS: Among 3 481 716 eligible members, 42.0% were White, 6.4% African American, 19.9% Hispanic, and 18.6% Asian; 13.0% were of other or unknown race. Of eligible members, 91 212 (2.6%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 3686 had positive results (overall incidence, 105.9 per 100 000 persons; by racial group, White, 55.1; African American, 123.1; Hispanic, 219.6; Asian, 111.7; other/unknown, 79.3). African American persons had the highest unadjusted testing and mortality rates, White persons had the lowest testing rates, and those with other or unknown race had the lowest mortality rates. Compared with White persons, adjusted testing rates among non-White persons were marginally higher, but infection rates were significantly higher; adjusted odds ratios [aORs] for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.31), 3.93 (CI, 3.59 to 4.30), 2.19 (CI, 1.98 to 2.42), and 1.57 (CI, 1.38 to 1.78), respectively. Geographic analyses showed that infections clustered in areas with higher proportions of non-White persons. Compared with White persons, adjusted hospitalization rates for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 1.47 (CI, 1.03 to 2.09), 1.42 (CI, 1.11 to 1.82), 1.47 (CI, 1.13 to 1.92), and 1.03 (CI, 0.72 to 1.46), respectively. Adjusted analyses showed no racial differences in inpatient mortality or total mortality during the study period. For testing, comorbid conditions made the greatest relative contribution to model explanatory power (77.9%); race only accounted for 8.1%. Likelihood of infection was largely due to race (80.3%). For other outcomes, age was most important; race only contributed 4.5% for hospitalization, 12.8% for admission illness severity, 2.3% for in-hospital death, and 0.4% for any death. LIMITATION: The study involved an insured population in a highly integrated health system. CONCLUSION: Race was the most important predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After infection, race was associated with increased hospitalization risk but not mortality.

Participants (N = 299) at risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD, i.e., score higher than 19 at the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), and 299 moderate drinkers (MOD, i.e., score lower than 8) individually matched for age, gender and education provided self-reports of alcohol consumption changes (i.e., number of alcohol units consumed during a typical week before and during lockdown). AUD were more likely (91.31%) than MOD (71.57%) to modify their consumption following lockdown (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to decrease (65.89% vs. 35.12%, p < 0.0001) and less likely to increase (25.42% vs. 36.45%, p = 0.004) their consumption than MOD. Analyses of post-pre lockdown differences in alcohol consumption showed that AUD presented a stronger decrease than MOD (-13.97 units/week vs. -0.07, p < 0.0001). Among individuals who decreased consumption, AUD decreased more (-27.92 vs. -2.74, p < 0.0001) than MOD. Among those who increased consumption, AUD increased more (17.32 vs. 2.44, p < 0.0001) than MOD. We thus observed sharp consumption increases or conversely abrupt decreases in individuals at high risk of alcohol use disorder, underscoring the need to develop prophylactic interventions for this population during such sanitary crises, to avoid brutal changes of the alcohol consumption pattern. Efforts should be made to mitigate consumption increases but also to favor progressive rather than sudden decreases in order to prevent damaging withdrawal symptoms.","Pabst, Arthur; Bollen, Zoé; Creupelandt, Coralie; Fontesse, Sullivan; Maurage, Pierre",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,315,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 13 closed-ended and open-ended questions was sent to all students (n = 97) at the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the University of Malta. Emergent themes from open-ended questions were identified and tallied. Since data were classified as categorical ranks, nonparametric tests were used to compare variables among the different courses, years of study, preclinical/clinical students, and gender categories. RESULTS: Dental technology students were significantly less stressed about contracting COVID-19 (P = 0.005) and regarding lack of preparation due to inability to physically go to the library (P = 0.019). Female students reported significantly more anxiety for the following factors: ""feeling anxious all the time"" (P = 0.033), ""worried about contracting COVID-19'"" (P = 0.012), ""worried that a family member may contract COVID-19'"" (P = 0.048), ""more anxious about exams this year because of the challenges we are facing"" (P = 0.029), and ""concern about losing manual dexterity skills"" (P = 0.038). Qualitative data gathered show considerable stress reported by students regarding changes in examination processes and formats and lack of timely communication. CONCLUSION: Students were greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and this caused fear of losing their manual dexterity skills, anxiety related to its consequences on their long-term plans, and anxiety related to the examinations. Dental schools in turn should adapt rapidly and customize changes that are specific to the individual student cohort and their stage of training.","Agius, Anne-Marie; Gatt, Gabriella; Vento Zahra, Ethel; Busuttil, Adrienne; Gainza-Cirauqui, Maria Luisa; Cortes, Arthur R G; Attard, Nikolai J",J. dent. educ,315,2

This has been coupled with reduced numbers of available medical professionals due to confirmed or suspected infections with SARS-CoV-2. To counteract these shortages, governments of several countries have considered the enrolment of medical students into the workforce in order to help to tackle the ongoing crisis. METHODS: Questionnaire-based study assessing the perceived role of medical students in assisting in the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim was to determine factors contributing to the willingness of medical students to actively assist in the pandemic. The secondary aim was to evaluate their perspectives regarding the associated changes in medical education. RESULTS: Out of 760 responses, 71.18% of medical students were willing to assist the medical workforce during the pandemic. Clinical year students were more likely to help in a medical capacity than pre-clinical students (OR = 0.384, 95%CI [0.167, 0.883, P < 0.05)]. Respondents concerned about their own well-being were less likely to engage in clinical work (OR = 0.680, 95%CI [0.491, 0.941], P < 0.020). Students who agreed that online lectures will negatively impact their education were inclined to think that the academic year should be extended (95%CI [0.065, 0.271], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most students are willing to help in both a medical and non-medical capacity. Their primary concerns when working in a medical setting are the risk of infecting their relatives and patients, lack of protective equipment and necessary knowledge as well as legal uncertainty whilst working without a medical qualification.","Michno, D A; Tan, J; Adelekan, A; Konczalik, W; Woollard, A C S",J. public health (Oxf),315,16

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from the review of medical charts of all consecutive patients treated with CERAB technique for AIOD between January 2016 and December 2019 in San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital (Rome, Italy). Clinical examination, duplex ultrasound with ankle-brachial index measurement and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography were performed preoperatively. A clinical and ultrasound follow-up was carried out at one month and then half yearly after the intervention to evaluate patients' clinical status, limb salvage, target lesion revascularization rate, primary and secondary patency rate. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 patients (14 men, 58.3%; 10 women, 41.7%; median age 59 years, range 37-79 years) underwent CERAB for AIOD (TASC II C 29.2%, TASC II D 70.8%). Indications for treatment were: intermittent claudication in 18 patients (75%) and critical limb ischemia in 6 (25%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Perioperative minor complications occurred in three cases (12.5%). One patient reported an intraoperative iliac rupture requiring adjunctive covered stenting. Median hospital length of stay was two days (range 1-9). No patient died perioperatively nor at the last follow-up. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-48 months), mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly (from 0.62 ± 0.15 before the procedure to 0.84 ± 0.18) (P < 0.001) and target lesion revascularization rate was 12.5%. At two years, the limb salvage rate was 100%, and primary and secondary patency rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CERAB technique demonstrated to be effective at the mid-term follow-up with low rate of complications and short length of stay. Long-term results and more robust data are needed to affirm this technique as the first-line treatment for extensive AIOD. However, it could become the preferred option especially in fragile patients and during contemporary COVID-19 pandemic due to the current limitations in vascular and critical care bed capacity.","Borghese, Ottavia; Ferrer, Ciro; Coscarella, Carlo; Spataro, Claudio; Diotallevi, Nicolò; Giudice, Rocco",Vascular,315,16

Recently, scientific research has widely demonstrated that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in modulating metabolic responses in the immune system. There is, in fact, a two-way interaction between lifestyle, infection, and immunity. The immune response is compromised if nutrition is unbalanced or insufficient, because diet affects the intestinal flora predisposing people to infections and, at the same time, the nutritional state can be aggravated by the immune response itself to the infection. We evaluate the link between balanced diet, the efficiency of the immune system, and microbiota with the aim of providing some practical advice for individuals, with special attention to the elderly. A correct lifestyle that follows the Mediterranean model, which is especially rich in plant-based foods along with the use of extra-virgin olive oil, are the basis of preventing LGI and other chronic pathologies, directly influencing the intestinal microbiota and consequently the immune response.","Suardi, Carlotta; Cazzaniga, Emanuela; Graci, Stephanie; Dongo, Dario; Palestini, Paola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),315,1

Highly fluorescent 5-alkynylfuropyrimidines were synthesized (97-46%) and their antiviral properties investigated in vitro. Regiochemistry of the functionalization was achieved with the aid of 5-endo-dig electrophilic halocyclization of acetyl 5-p-tolyl- or 5-p-pentylphenyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Structure of one of the resulting nucleosides, 6-p-tolyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-one, was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and its conformation was compared to related nucleosides. Diverse alkynyl substituents were introduced at the heterobicyclic base C-5 position via Sonogashira coupling of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ones. The resulting compounds had fluorescence emissions of 452-481 nm. High quantum yields of 0.53-0.60 were observed for 9-ethynyl-9-fluorenol and propargyl alcohol/methyl ether-modified furopyrimidines. These modified nucleosides, designed in the form of ribose acetyl esters, are potential tools for fluorescent tagging, studying nucleoside metabolism, 2'-deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity, and antiviral activity. Antiviral assays against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses showed that in human embryonic lung (HEL) cell cultures some of the compounds posess antiviral activity (EC50 1.3-13.2 µM) against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The alkynyl furopyrimidine with two p-pentylphenyl substituents emerged as the best compound with reasonable and selective anti-VZV activity, confirming p-pentylphenyl potency as a pharmacophore.","Kaczmarek, Renata; Twardy, Dylan J; Olson, Trevor L; Korczynski, Dariusz; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Dolot, Rafal; Wheeler, Kraig A; Dembinski, Roman",Eur J Med Chem,315,1

How ophthalmologists evaluate their risk of infection and whether they are willing to be vaccinated has not been investigated so far. The aim of this project was to assess the subjective rating of the risk of infection and the willingness to be vaccinated among German ophthalmologists. METHODS: Data were collected by an anonymous online survey conducted by the Professional Association of Ophthalmologists in Germany (BVA) and the German Ophthalmological Society (DOG) under the auspices of the University Eye Hospital Düsseldorf. The questionnaire was open for participation from 22 January to 12 February 2021. The survey was addressed to all colleagues in ophthalmology. RESULTS: A total of 1162 completed questionnaires were analyzed. On average, survey respondents rated their risk of infection as 7.5â¯± 1.9 (scale of 1-10; 1â¯= very low risk, 10â¯= very high risk). Of the respondents 971 (83.6%) rated their risk of infection as higher compared to other disciplines and 92.9% (nâ¯= 1079) indicated they would be willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmologists interviewed consider their professional group to be exposed to an above-average risk of SARS-COV­2 infection compared to other disciplines. They frequently criticized the prioritization ranking of the German Ministry of Health (BMG), which deviated from the suggestions of the Standing Vaccination Committee of Germany (STIKO). The willingness to be vaccinated was very high among the surveyed German ophthalmologists.","Roth, M; Holtmann, C; Tillmann, A; Bertram, B; Geerling, G",Ophthalmologe,315,1

IR encounters were collected by gathering the weekly volume of submitted E&amp;M current procedural technology (CPT) codes from the IR division. IR encounters were classified as outpatient or telehealth E&amp;M. The E&amp;M volume in 2019 was used as a historical control. Data were divided into three periods: pre-surge (January 6–March 15, 2020), surge (March 16–June 7, 2020), and recovery (June 8–August 23, 2020). The mean encounters per week during the surge and recovery periods were compared to the pre-surge baseline using a Welch t test for 2020 data, and the same comparison was made for 2019 data for a historical control. Results: During the surge period, outpatient E&amp;M volume, inclusive of telemedicine, fell by 55.8% relative to the pre-surge 2020 baseline. The volume grew steadily during the recovery period but remained 19.8% below pre-surge 2020 levels. The surge and recovery mean weekly E&amp;M volume was significantly different from the equivalent periods in 2019 (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). During the surge, telemedicine comprised 44.6% of the total outpatient E&amp;M. The contribution of telemedicine gradually fell over the recovery period, comprising just 11.5% in the final week of the study, and 16.7% during the recovery. Outpatient E&amp;M reached a nadir during the week of April 13th, reflecting a 70.6% decline relative to the same period in 2019. The recovery period demonstrated a gradual increase in outpatient E&amp;M with a decline in telehealth encounters balanced by a growth of in-person visits. During the last week of the recovery period (week of 8/17), outpatient in-person E&amp;M had recovered to 2019 levels, and with the inclusion of telehealth exceeded E&amp;M in 2019 for the same period by 93.3%. Conclusions: Telemedicine becomes an important way to maintain outpatient E&amp;M volume in the event of a pandemic when social distancing and stay-at-home orders preclude face-to-face visits. Revenue from outpatient E&amp;M may help bridge the gap until resumption of elective procedures and recovery of procedural case volume.","Goldman, D.; Sharma, H.; Finkelstein, M.; Carlon, T.; Fischman, A.; Bishay, V.; Patel, R.; Titano, J.; Nowakowski, F.; Kim, E.; Lookstein, R.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,315,24

The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic over time in 28 countries was analysed and fit to several simple rate models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate projections for more recent data. While the Gompertz growth model (mean R2 = 0.998) best fit the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit introduced significant model errors. However, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fit the current data best for 25 (89%) countries as determined by R2 values of the remaining models. Projection to the future using the simple quadratic model accurately forecast the number of future total number of cases 50% of the time up to 10 days in advance. Extrapolation to the future with the simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases. These results demonstrate that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given country can be made using this very simple model.","Blanco, N; Stafford, K A; Lavoie, M C; Brandenburg, A; Górna, M W; Merski, M",Epidemiol Infect,315,24

Group testing is a well-established mathematical tool, which can provide a serious and rapid improvement to this situation. In this note, we compare several well-established group testing schemes in the context of qPCR testing for COVID-19. We include example calculations, where we indicate which testing architectures yield the greatest efficiency gains in various settings.

456957,456957,456957,Audio Interview: Studying Potential Covid-19 Therapies,15.337825,6.711685,2020,"BACKGROUND: In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% UI 0·62-1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0·88, 0·66-1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0·88, 0·60-1·43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric emergency care flowchart. SOURCES: The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published through July 3, 2020. The reference lists of the selected articles were manually searched to identify any additional articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is less severe in children than in adults, but can present as MIS-C, even in patients without comorbidities. There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C can develop weeks after COVID-19 infection, suggesting an immunomediated cause. The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy are common laboratory findings. Supportive treatment and early immunomodulation can control the intense inflammatory response and reduce complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is serious, rare, and potentially fatal. The emergency department pediatrician must recognize and treat it early using immunomodulatory strategies to reduce systemic injury. Further studies are needed to identify the disease pathogenesis and establish the most appropriate treatment.","Simon Junior, Hany; Sakano, Tania Miyuki Shimoda; Rodrigues, Regina Maria; Eisencraft, Adriana Pasmanik; Carvalho, Vitor Emanoel Lemos de; Schvartsman, Claudio; Reis, Amelia Gorete Afonso da Costa",,315,9

A set of robust binary sequences of 128 bits long were generated, known as secret session keys, and will be transported to both the parties. The web-portal will capture all the patients' symptoms. Then homeopathy E-Prescriptions would be generated by the psychiatrists. This transmission of E-Prescription would be done using the proposed secret session key using Advanced Encryption Standards.

Deregulated inflammasome-mediated release of interleukin-1 family cytokines is important in hyper-inflammatory syndromes, like happens in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome. We propose that an intense inflammasome formation characterizes the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 disease due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Samples from four patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who had been hospitalized at the Hospital of the University of Trieste (Italy) and died of ARDS and four lung samples from a historical repository from subjects who had died of cardiopulmonary arrest and had not been placed on mechanical ventilation and without evidence of pulmonary infection at postmortem examination were collected. Pathology samples had been fixed in formalin 10% at time of collection and subsequently embedded in paraffin. We conducted staining for ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain), NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3), and cleaved caspase-1. RESULTS: Intense expression of the inflammasome was detected, mainly in leukocytes, within the lungs of all patients with fatal COVID-19 in the areas of lung injury. The number of ASC inflammasome specks per high power fields was significantly higher in the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 as compared with the lungs of control subjects (52 ± 22 vs 6 ± 3, P = 0.0064). CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify the presence of NLRP3 inflammasome aggregates in the lungs of fatal COVID-19 pneumonia thus providing the potential molecular link between viral infection and cytokine release syndrome.","Toldo, Stefano; Bussani, Rossana; Nuzzi, Vincenzo; Bonaventura, Aldo; Mauro, Adolfo G; Cannatà, Antonio; Pillappa, Raghavendra; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Nana-Sinkam, Patrick; Sime, Patricia; Abbate, Antonio",Inflamm. res,315,25

In particular, the spatial spread of a disease is a consequence of human mobility. On the other hand, the control strategies based on mobility restrictions are generally unpopular and costly. These high social and economic costs make it very important to design global protocols where the cost is minimized and effects maximized. In this work, we calculate the percolation threshold of the spread in a network of a disease. In particular, we found the number of roads to close and regions to isolate in the Puebla State, Mexico, to avoid the global spread of COVID-19. Computational simulations taking into account the proposed strategy show a potential reduction of 94% of infections. This methodology can be used in broader and different areas to help in the design of health policies. -- La movilidad de las personas es uno de los principales factores que propician la propagaci\'on de epidemias.

The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to ICU admission. At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.","Kluge, Stefan; Janssens, Uwe; Welte, Tobias; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Marx, Gernot; Karagiannidis, Christian",Med.

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with 4 widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than 1 symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, nâ¯=â¯641), and anxiety the least (7.1%, nâ¯=â¯69). After adjustment for confounders, it was found that dental practitioners with preexisting physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.972; 95% CI, 1.128-3.448; Pâ¯=â¯.017), and perceived stress (odds ratio, 2.397 95% CI, 1.283-4.478; Pâ¯=â¯.006). Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the 4 psychological symptoms observed (P < .05).

In the systems in which the interaction proceeds along the potential gradient (positive work), the re-sultant potential energy is found based on the principle of adding reciprocals of corresponding values of subsystems. This is the corpuscular process, in which entropy can serve as the theoreti-cal concept. In the systems in which the interactions proceed against the potential gradient (nega-tive work) the algebraic addition of their masses, as well as the corresponding energies of subsys-tems is performed. This is the wave process, in which negentropy can serve as the theoretical con-cept. The resonance stationary state of the systems is fulfilled under the condition of equality of degrees of their corpuscular and wave interactions. The entropy products in stationary state are completely compensated by the negentropy flow. Mathematically and graphically (by nomo-grams) the stationary state in microsystems is found by the following equation containing the tangent of the geodesic angel. The geodesic angle numerically defines the ratio of two legs of the right triangle whose values characterize energy dependencies through axial and circumferential stresses in the system with corpuscular-wave processes. This condition corresponds to the most optimal technological options and is widely present in nature, as well as in fractal systems. The initial nomograms of entropic and negentropic characteristics for many processes and phenome-na in nature, engineering and physical chemistry are given.

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) imaging in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of fifty patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-seven patients survived, while 23 passed away. CT imaging was performed in all of the patients on the day of admission. Imaging findings were interpreted based on current guidelines by two expert radiologists. Imaging findings were compared between surviving and deceased patients. Lung scores were assigned to patients based on CT chest findings. Then, the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine cutoff values for lung scores. RESULTS: The common radiologic findings were ground-glass opacities (82%) and airspace consolidation (42%), respectively. Air bronchogram was more commonly seen in deceased patients (p = 0.04). Bilateral and multilobar involvement was more frequently found in deceased patients (p = 0.049 and 0.014, respectively). The mean number of involved lobes was 3.46 ± 1.80 lobes in surviving patients and 4.57 ± 0.60 lobes in the deceased patients (p = 0.009). The difference was statistically significant. The area under the curve for a lung score cutoff of 12 was 0.790. CONCLUSION: Air bronchogram and bilateral and multilobar involvement were more frequently seen in deceased patients and may suggest a poor outcome for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Mirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad; Zarrintan, Armin; Nezami, Nariman; Mohammadi, Afshin; Zarrintan, Anita; Mohebbi, Iraj; Pirnejad, Habibollah; Khademvatani, Kamal; Ashkavand, Zahra; Forughi, Payman; Arasteh, Amin; Attari, Javad Aghazadeh",Emerg Radiol,315,5

Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8% of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctivas, 12 melanomas, seven squamous cell carcinomas, and seven papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median: 0.0 transcripts per million [TPM], min: 0.0 TPM, max: 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.","Lange, Clemens; Wolf, Julian; Auw-Haedrich, Claudia; Schlecht, Anja; Boneva, Stefaniya; Lapp, Thabo; Horres, Ralf; Agostini, Hansjürgen; Martin, Gottfried; Reinhard, Thomas; Schlunck, Günther",J. med. virol,315,16

Here, we report the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In normal human airway epithelial cells, the concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.47 µM, very similar to its EC90 against human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. Little to no cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 at concentrations up to 100 µM. Substantial levels of the active triphosphate metabolite AT-9010 were formed in normal human bronchial and nasal epithelial cells incubated with 10 µM AT-511 (698 ± 15 and 236 ± 14 µM, respectively), with a half-life of at least 38 h. Results from steady-state pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of nonhuman primates administered oral doses of AT-527, as well as pharmacokinetic data from subjects given daily oral doses of AT-527, predict that twice daily oral doses of 550 mg AT-527 will produce AT-9010 trough concentrations in human lung that exceed the EC90 observed for the prodrug against SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven trained and experienced practitioners of both mindfulness and forest bathing. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed four main themes: (i) differences between the approaches;(ii) the benefits of forest bathing;(iii) biophilia through forest bathing;and (iv) inward versus outward attentional focus as a distinction between the approaches. Both practices were found to benefit well-being, but practitioners revealed key barriers to mindfulness. For vulnerable groups experiencing mental health challenges or difficulties achieving a meditative state, mindfulness may introduce well-being risks. By offering a gentler, more intuitive approach that encourages outward attentional focus, forest bathing was found to overcome this barrier. Forest bathing is suitable for all groups, but adaptations are recommended for those expressing fear or discomfort in forested environments. The findings inform how to position both approaches in practice, as a first step towards social prescribing recommendations. Wider implications concern forest bathing’s potential to impact environmental well-being.

Historic variable infection control guideline adherence, combined with recent PPE shortages, challenges healthcare organisations’ ability to adequately protect team members.1 3 Telemedicine is a risk-reduction strategy to minimise staff exposure and to conserve PPE by decreasing bedside team size and enabling remote assistance in neonatal resuscitation.4 No previous studies have described on-site telemedicine, as ‘virtual personal protective equipment’ (VPE), to limit bedside staff exposures and to preserve PPE during paediatric resuscitations. Outside teams, located outside the patient room, communicated via telemedicine and included the physician team leader, documenter, PPE coach, medication prep nurse, pharmacist, consultants and additional staff (online supplementary figure 1 and table 1).Table 1 Resuscitation team structure and PPE compliance Pre-COVID (2019) COVID era Resuscitations reviewed 40 clinical PED resuscitations 12 (8 simulations (2 special isolation units and 6 PEDs) and 4 clinical PED resuscitations) Number of staff in resuscitation room Goal: 13–18 Team leader, airway physician, survey physician, order entry physician, history/family physician, medication administration nurse, medication preparation nurse, documenter, circulating nurse (one to two), cardiopulmonary resuscitation coach, circulating technician (one to two), respiratory therapy (one to two), social work and consultants (one to three) Actual total team : 14–19 (range) Goal: 4–5 Airway physician, bedside physician (combining role of survey physician and assistant for procedures), bedside nurses (one to two) and respiratory therapy Actual total team size: 4–6 (range) Compliance with recommended PPE* 22.5% (9/40) 83.3% (10/12) *PPE for PED pre-COVID resuscitations was gowns, simple face masks and gloves;in the COVID era, PPE standards were updated regularly per availability and guidelines.","Keilman, Ashley Elizabeth Umoren Rachel Lo Mark Roberts Joan Yoshida Hiromi Hartford Emily Patrao Fiona Burns Brian Fenstermacher Sara Masse Elizabeth Reid Jennifer",BMJ Simulation &amp; Technology Enhanced Learning,315,24

The study design was cross-sectional and the participants were 200 pregnant women. The first group called the Pandemic Group (PG) included 100 women who were evaluated with psychological assessment instruments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second group titled Pre-Pandemic Group (PPG) consisted of 100 women who were evaluated prior to the pandemic. Perceived stress, prenatal concerns and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated and compared. Pandemic Group scored significantly higher than Pre-Pandemic Group in the depression dimension of the SCL-90, in the phobic anxiety dimension, and in the Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, insomnia, along with having recently suffered the loss of a loved one explained 25% of the score variance in the depression dimension of the SCL-90. Insomnia also explained 13% of the variance of the results found in the Perceived Stress Scale. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 increased the scores obtained in the phobic anxiety dimension, explaining 11% of the variance. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could produce an increase in psychopathological symptomatology and stress, which can lead to negatively affecting pregnant women's mental health.","Puertas-Gonzalez, Jose A; Mariño-Narvaez, Carolina; Peralta-Ramirez, Maria Isabel; Romero-Gonzalez, Borja",Psychiatry Res,315,27

MethodsIn March 2021, an online questionnaire on vaccination acceptance was proposed to adults included in a longitudinal cohort study of previous population-based serosurveys carried out in the canton of Geneva. Questions were asked about COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, reasons of acceptance or refusal, and attitudes about vaccination in general. Data on demographic (age, sex, education, income, professional status, living conditions) and health-related characteristics (having a chronic disease, COVID-19 diagnosis, smoking status) were assessed at inclusion in the cohort (December 2020). ResultsOverall, 4067 participants (completion rate of 77.4%) responded to the survey between March 17 and April 1, 2021. The mean age of respondents was 53.3 years and 56.0% were women. Most had completed tertiary education (64.7%) and over 60% were currently professionally active. At the time of the survey, 17.2% of respondents had already been vaccinated with at least one dose or had made an appointment to get vaccinated, and an additional 58.5% intended or rather intended to get vaccinated. The overall acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was 75.7%, with a higher acceptance among men compared to women, older adults compared to younger adults, high-income individuals compared to those with a low income, participants living in urban and semi-urban areas compared to rural, and retirees and students compared to employed individuals. Acceptance was lower among individuals having completed apprenticeships and secondary education compared to those with tertiary education. The most common reasons reported by participants intending to get vaccinated were the desire to get back to normal, to protect themselves, their community and/or society, and their relatives or friends against the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as the desire to travel. Less than half (45.6%) of participants having children were willing or rather willing to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if it were recommended by public health authorities. ConclusionAlthough our study found a 75.7% acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, there were noticeable socio-demographic disparities in vaccination acceptance. These data will be useful for public health measures targeting hesitant populations when developing health communication strategies. These results will be updated over time with a new release of the survey in autumn 2021.","Wisniak, Ania; Baysson, Helene; Pullen, Nick; Nehme, Mayssam; Pennacchio, Francesco; Zaballa, Maria-Eugenia; Guessous, Idris; Stringhini, Silvia; group, - Specchio-COVID19 study",,315,23

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","Belhadjer, Zahra; Méot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Maëlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Benoît; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien",Circulation,315,10

Walkers were instructed to e.g. ignore the participant, greet him or her, or attempt to hand out a flyer. The participant's gaze was mostly directed to the currently relevant body parts of the walker. Thus, the participants gaze depended on the walker's action. Individual differences in participant's looking behavior were consistent across walkers. Participants who did not respond to the walker seemed to look less at that walker, although this difference was not statistically significant.

To date, no systematic reviews have been published on this topic. This systematic review aimed to summarize and highlight the frequency of bat infections reported in currently available observational studies for coronavirus. The purpose of this study was also to examine the differences between the pool prevalence by technique and country. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess coronavirus (CoV) infection in bats and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We carried out random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). In all, 824 articles were retrieved (1960-2021). After screening by abstract/title, 43 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 33 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From the total of studies, the pool prevalence by RT-PCR (n=14,295 bats) for CoV was 9.8% (95% CI 8.7-10.9%);Italy reported the highest pooled prevalence (44.9%, 95% CI 31.6-58.1%), followed by the Philippines (29.6%). Regarding the ELISA, the pool prevalence for coronavirus from 15 studies, including 359 bats, was 30.2% (95% CI 14.7-45.6%). The results for coronaviruses with the MIF were significantly lower, 2.6% (95% CI 1.5-3.7%). A considerable proportion of infected bats tested positive, particularly by molecular tests. This essential condition highlights the relevance of bats and the need for future studies to detail their role as potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. In this meta-analysis, bats were positive in almost 10% by RT-PCR, suggesting their relevance and the need to understand their potential participation in maintaining wild zoonotic transmission.","Bonilla-Aldana, D.

The mean duration from symptom onset to first positive RT-PCR was 4·7 days (SD 3·67), while that of symptom onset to last positive test was 17·83 days (SD 6·22). Proportions of positive RT-PCR tests were 100%, 49%, 24%, 8·7% and 20·6% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th & >4 weeks of illness. 12 symptomatic patients had prolonged positive test results even after 3 weeks of symptom onset. Age > = 60 years was associated with prolonged RT-PCR positivity (statistically significant). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the average period of PCR positivity is more than 2 weeks in COVID-19 patients; elderly patients have prolonged duration of RT-PCR positivity and requires further follow up.","Bhattacharya, Bisakh; Kumar, Rohit; Meena, Ved Prakash; Soneja, Manish; Singh, Amit; Das, Rojaleen; Xess, Ashit; Arif, Nazneen; Vig, Saurabh; Rastogi, Vandana; Tiwari, Pavan; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Mohan, Anant; Wig, Naveet; Dar, Lalit",Pathog.

On September 17, 2020, a Utah correctional facility (facility A) received a report of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dental health care provider (DHCP) who had treated incarcerated persons at facility A on September 14, 2020 while asymptomatic. On September 21, 2020, the roommate of an incarcerated person who had received dental treatment experienced COVID-19-compatible symptoms*; both were housed in block 1 of facility A (one of 16 occupied blocks across eight residential units). Two days later, the roommate received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, becoming the first person with a known-associated case of COVID-19 at facility A. During September 23-24, 2020, screening of 10 incarcerated persons who had received treatment from the DHCP identified another two persons with COVID-19, prompting isolation of all three patients in an unoccupied block at the facility. Within block 1, group activities were stopped to limit interaction among staff members and incarcerated persons and prevent further spread. During September 14-24, 2020, six facility A staff members, one of whom had previous close contact with one of the patients, also reported symptoms. On September 27, 2020, an outbreak was confirmed after specimens from all remaining incarcerated persons in block 1 were tested; an additional 46 cases of COVID-19 were identified, which were reported to the Salt Lake County Health Department and the Utah Department of Health. On September 30, 2020, CDC, in collaboration with both health departments and the correctional facility, initiated an investigation to identify factors associated with the outbreak and implement control measures.

The standard diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 are PCR-based genetic assays. Antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic assays are alternative methods of detecting this virus. Rapid diagnosis kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. STUDY DESIGN: Three monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were used to develop an antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. These assays were evaluated usingã nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: These assays detected recombinant SARS-CoV-2â¯N protein at concentrations >0.2â¯ng/mL within 10â¯min after protein loading, but did not detect the N proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 299E (HCoV-229E) and other pathogens causing respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained 1ï½3, 4ï½9, and &#8805; 10 days after symptom onset from COVID-19 patients diagnosed by RT-PCR showed positivity rates of 100 %, >80 %, and <30 %, respectively.

BACKGROUND: During the unprecedented era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of countries worldwide adopted very strong measures. Universities closed their doors, and education continued through digital learning lectures. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all 189 eligible candidates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health was assessed via the MH domain of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 81.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 18.1% vs. COVID-19 18.2%). However, the burnout prevalence dropped significantly in year 4 (pre-COVID-19 40.7% vs. COVID-19 16.7%, p = 0.011), whereas it increased significantly in year 6 (pre-COVID-19 27.6% vs. COVID-19 50%, p = 0.01). When looking at each MBI-SS dimension separately, we found that emotional exhaustion decreased significantly in year 4 but increased in year 6, and cynicism increased in all years. The overall MH deteriorated significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 58.8 ± 21.6 vs. COVID-19 48.3 ± 23, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Digital learning in medical studies carries significant risks. Not only does the MH deteriorate, but cynicism levels also increase. Emotional exhaustion was found to increase particularly in final year students, who struggle with the lack of clinical experience just before they start working as qualified junior doctors.","Zis, Panagiotis; Artemiadis, Artemios; Bargiotas, Panagiotis; Nteveros, Antonios; Hadjigeorgiou, Georgios M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),315,24

Si les études réalisées jusqu'alors sur des échantillons relativement faibles, sont rassurantes, nous manquons toujours de données à plus grande échelle pour mieux apprécier ce risque. À partir de la base PMSI (Programme de Médicalisation des Systes d'Information) nationale, nous avons extrait les données relatives aux séjours hospitaliers de tous les patients lupiques entre mars et octobre 2020 en France. Parmi ces séjours, nous avons identifié ceux pour lesquels un diagnostic de COVID avait été rapporté afin de séparer les patients en trois groupes : les patients n'ayant pas été infectés par le SarS CoV2 (LES/COVID-), les patients infectés ayant eu une forme sévère de COVID définie comme un passage en réanimation et/ou le décès (LES/COVID + forme sévère) et les patients infectés ayant eu une évolution non sévère du COVID (LES/COVID + forme non sévère). Nous avons ensuite comparé les caractéristiques des patients issus de ces trois groupes. Nous avons également comparé la mortalité par classe d'âge associée au COVID à celle de la population générale sur la même période. Nous avons identifié 11 055 patients lupiques ayant un séjour hospitalier en France entre mars et octobre 2020. Parmi eux,1411 (12,8 %) avaient un diagnostic de COVID dont 341 formes sévères et1070 formes non sévères. Les patients ayant une forme sévère de COVID19 étaient plus âgés que les patients ayant une forme non sévère (61,5 ± 17,6 versus 55,8 ± 18,7 années;p &lt; 0,001). Par ailleurs, les patients développant une forme sévère étaient plus souvent de sexe masculin (n = 96,28,2 % vs n = 171, 16,0 % ;p &lt; 0,001), avaient plus de comorbidités non spécifiques du lupus comme l'HTA (n = 215, 63,1 % vs n = 480, 44,9 % ;p &lt; 0,001), le diabète (n = 72,21,1 % vs 173, 16,2 % ;p = 0,03) ou l'insuffisance rénale chronique (n = 108, 31,7 % vs n = 184, 17,2 % ;p &lt; 0,001). Parmi les éléments spécifiques de la maladie lupique, seul un antécédent de glomérulonéphrite lupique était significativement associé à une forme sévère de COVID19 (n = 77, p = 22,6 % vs n = 158, 14,8 % ;p &lt; 0,001). Au total, 134 patients lupiques sont décédés à l'hôpital dans les suites du COVID19 sur la période d'étude. La mortalité hospitalière liée au COVID19 était donc de 9,5 % soit presque 4 fois plus que la mortalité des autres patients lupiques hospitalisés sur la même période (2,4 %). Comparés à la population générale hospitalisée pour COVID19, les patients lupiques avaient une mortalité significativement plus faible (9,5 % vs 15,7 %, p &lt; 0,001) avec une grande variation selon l'âge. En ce qui concerne les patients jeunes (mois de 60 ans), il y avait une tendance non significative à un excès de mortalité parmi les lupiques par rapport à la population générale. À l'échelle nationale, il ne semble pas y avoir de surmortalité liée au COVID19 chez les patients atteints de Lupus Erythémateux Systémique. Les facteurs associés aux formes sévères de COVID19 chez les lupiques semblent rejoindre ceux de la population générale. Néanmoins, il pourrait exister un excès de mortalité chez les jeunes lupiques par rapport à la population générale qui incite à la prudence, et qui pourrait pousser les autorités à prioriser cette population pour l'accès à la vaccination au sein d'une même classe d'âge.

Firstly, we investigated Cu-toxic effects on metabolomics, the levels of free amino acids, NH4+-N, NO3--N, total nitrogen, total soluble proteins, total phenolics, lignin, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde, and the activities of nitrogen-assimilatory enzymes in 'Shatian' pummelo (Citrus grandis) leaves. Then, a conjoint analysis of metabolomics, physiology and transcriptomics was performed. Herein, 59 upregulated [30 primary metabolites (PMs) and 29 secondary metabolites (SMs)] and 52 downregulated (31 PMs and 21 SMs) metabolites were identified in Cu-toxic leaves. The toxicity of Cu to leaves was related to the Cu-induced accumulation of NH4+ and decrease of nitrogen assimilation. Metabolomics combined with physiology and transcriptomics revealed some adaptive responses of C. grandis leaves to Cu-toxicity, including (a) enhancing tryptophan metabolism and the levels of some amino acids and derivatives (tryptophan, phenylalanine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, 5-oxoproline and GSH); (b) increasing the accumulation of carbohydrates and alcohols and upregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle and the levels of some organic acids and derivatives (chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, d-tartaric acid and gallic acid o-hexoside); (c) reducing phospholipid (lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine) levels, increasing non-phosphate containing lipid [monoacylglycerol ester (acyl 18:2) isomer 1] levels, and inducing low-phosphate-responsive gene expression; and (d) triggering the biosynthesis of some chelators (total phenolics, lignin, l-trytamine, indole, eriodictyol C-hexoside, quercetin 5-O-malonylhexosyl-hexoside, N-caffeoyl agmatine, N'-p-coumaroyl agmatine, hydroxy-methoxycinnamate and protocatechuic acid o-glucoside) and vitamins and derivatives (nicotinic acid-hexoside, B1 and methyl nicotinate). Cu-induced upregulation of many antioxidants could not protect Cu-toxic leaves from oxidative damage. To conclude, our findings corroborated the hypothesis that extensive reprogramming of metabolites was carried out in Cu-toxic C. grandis leaves in order to cope with Cu-toxicity.","Huang, Hui-Yu; Ren, Qian-Qian; Lai, Yin-Hua; Peng, Ming-Yi; Zhang, Jiang; Yang, Lin-Tong; Huang, Zeng-Rong; Chen, Li-Song",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,315,16

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases to identify any reported cases of maternal, fetal or neonatal mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The references of relevant studies were also hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 2815 studies screened, 10 studies reporting 37 maternal and 12 perinatal mortality cases (7 fetal demise and 5 neonatal death) were finally eligible for inclusion to this review. All maternal deaths were seen in women with previous co-morbidities, of which the most common were obesity, diabetes, asthma and advanced maternal age. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severity of pneumonia were considered as the leading causes of all maternal mortalities, except for one case who died of thromboembolism during postpartum period. Fetal and neonatal mortalities were suggested to be a result of the severity of maternal infection or the prematurity, respectively. Interestingly, there was no evidence of vertical transmission or positive COVID-19 test result among expired neonates. CONCLUSION: Current available evidence suggested that maternal mortality mostly happened among women with previous co-morbidities and neonatal mortality seems to be a result of prematurity rather than infection. However, further reports are needed so that the magnitude of the maternal and perinatal mortality could be determined more precisely.","Hessami, Kamran; Homayoon, Nahid; Hashemi, Atefe; Vafaei, Homeira; Kasraeian, Maryam; Asadi, Nasrin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,315,10

As an advance to current static assessments, we present a dynamic soil functions assessment (SFA) to evaluate the current and future state of soils regarding their nutrient storage, water regulation, productivity, habitat and carbon sequestration functions for the case-study region in the Lower Austrian Mostviertel. Carbon response functions simulating the development of regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks until 2100 are used to couple established indicator-based SFA methodology with two climate and three land use scenarios, i.e. land sparing (LSP), land sharing (LSH), and balanced land use (LBA). Results reveal a dominant impact of land use scenarios on soil functions compared to the impact from climate scenarios and highlight the close link between SOC development and the quality of investigated soil functions, i.e. soil functionality. The soil habitat and soil carbon sequestration functions on investigated agricultural land are positively affected by maintenance of grassland under LSH (20% of the case-study region), where SOC stocks show a steady and continuous increase. By 2100 however, total regional SOC stocks are higher under LSP compared to LSH or LBA, due to extensive afforestation. The presented approach may improve integrative decision-making in land use planning processes. It bridges superordinate goals of sustainable development, such as climate change mitigation, with land use actions taken at local or regional scales. The dynamic SFA broadens the debate on LSH and LSP and can reduce trade-offs between soil functions through land use planning processes.","Jost, Elisabeth; Schönhart, Martin; Skalský, Rastislav; Balkovic, Juraj; Schmid, Erwin; Mitter, Hermine",J Environ Manage,315,21

However, little is known about the public willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine in China. This study aimed to understand the willingness and determinants for the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese adults. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in an adult population in China. Chi-square tests were used to identify differences for various intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The t test was used to identify differences among vaccine hesitancy scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the predicated factors associated with the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of the 3195 eligible participants, 83.8% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and 76.6% believed the vaccine would be beneficial to their health; however, 74.9% expressed concerns or a neutral attitude regarding its potential adverse effects. Of the participants, 76.5% preferred domestically manufactured vaccines and were more willing to be vaccinated than those who preferred imported vaccines. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lack of confidence, complacency in regard to health, risk of the vaccine, and attention frequency were the main factors affecting the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

In this work we compared the conformation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein expressed in P. pastoris and in the well established HEK-293T mammalian cell system. RBD obtained from both yeast and mammalian cells was properly folded, as indicated by UV-absorption, circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence. They also had similar stability, as indicated by temperature-induced unfolding (observed Tm were 50 °C and 52 °C for RBD produced in P. pastoris and HEK-293T cells, respectively). Moreover, the stability of both variants was similarly reduced when the ionic strength was increased, in agreement with a computational analysis predicting that a set of ionic interactions may stabilize RBD structure. Further characterization by high-performance liquid chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed a higher heterogeneity of RBD expressed in P. pastoris relative to that produced in HEK-293T cells, which disappeared after enzymatic removal of glycans. The production of RBD in P. pastoris was scaled-up in a bioreactor, with yields above 45 mg/L of 90% pure protein, thus potentially allowing large scale immunizations to produce neutralizing antibodies, as well as the large scale production of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.",,Sci Rep,315,16

These tasks are challenging and require an integrated knowledge of the complex processes that regulate gene expression and, ultimately, protein functionality in vivo, the effects of mutations/polymorphisms and the different sources of interindividual phenotypic variability. A remarkable example of our advances in these challenging tasks is the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolization of many of the most marketed drugs (including SARS-Cov-2 therapies such as hydroxychloroquine). Since the introduction of simple activity scores (AS) over 10 years ago, its ability to establish genotype-phenotype correlations on the drug metabolizing capacity of this enzyme in human population has provided lessons that will help to improve this type of score for this, and likely many other human genes and proteins. Multidisciplinary research emerges as the best approach to incorporate additional concepts to refine and improve such functional/activity scores for the CYP2D6 gene, as well as for many other human genes associated with simple and complex genetic diseases.","Pey, Angel L",,315,16

The research applied the quantitative method and an online questionnaire conducted in February 2021, whereby data from 1676 public administration employees were obtained. The results of the research show that at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, 80% of the respondents performed work during nonwork time. In fact, public employees quite often worked late in the afternoon after working hours and on weekends. Interestingly, about 10% of public employees even worked during annual leave and sick leave.

METHOD: In-person qualitative interviews informed by an adaptation of Karasek's Job Demand-control model were conducted with a convenience sample of healthcare workforce from March to April 2020. RESULTS: Themes emerging from interviews coalesced around three main areas: fear of uncertainty, physical and psychological manifestations of stress, and resilience building. Shifting information, a lack of PPE, and fear of infecting others prompted worry for those working with Covid-infected patients. Participants reported that stress manifested more psychologically than physically. Individualized stress mitigation efforts, social media and organizational transparency were reported by healthcare workers to be effective against rising stressors.

This drought has had major socio-economic effects particularly on the large impoverished rural population as well as on some urban areas where supplied water services have broken down in several cases. The region is influenced by both midlatitude and tropical systems leading to a complex regional meteorology that hitherto has not been much studied compared to other parts of South Africa. Here, the ongoing drought is examined in the context of long-term trends and the interannual rainfall variability of the region. Although the region has experienced drought in all seasons since 2015, focus here is placed on the spring (September-November) which shows the most consistent and robust signal. On average, this season contributes between about 25-35% of the annual rainfall total. Based on CHIRPS data, it is found that this season shows a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall totals as well as the number of rainfall days (but not heavy rainfall days) for spring over most of the province since 1981. On interannual time scales, the results indicate that dry (wet) springs over the Eastern Cape are associated with a cyclonic (anticyclonic) anomaly southeast of South Africa as part of a shift in the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern in the midlatitudes. Over the landmass, a stronger (weaker) Botswana High is also apparent with increased (decreased) subsidence over and near the Eastern Cape which is less (more) favourable for cloud band development and hence reduced (enhanced) rainfall during dry (wet) springs. Analysis of mid-century (2040-2060) CMIP5 rainfall projections suggests that there may be a flattening of the annual cycle over the Eastern Cape with the winter becoming wetter and the summer drier. For the spring season of interest here, the multi-model projections also indicate drying but less pronounced than that projected for the summer.","Mahlalela, P T; Blamey, R C; Hart, N C G; Reason, C J C",Clim Dyn,315,17

DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. SETTING: Participants responded to an on-line survey in June 2020. SUBJECTS: The study included 3,183 residents within Quebec, Canada aged 18 and over. MEASURES: Measures include perceived COVID-19 related discrimination, fear of COVID-19 infection, prior exposure to COVID-19, and prior social distancing behavior. Participants self-reported attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and perceived norms related to social distancing. Finally, we measured social distancing behavioral intention. ANALYSIS: We evaluated a theory of planned behavior (TPB) measurement model of social distancing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The association between COVID-19 perceived discrimination, fear of infection, previous social distancing behavior, exposure to COVID-19, TPB constructs and behavioral intentions to social distance were estimated using SEM path analysis. RESULTS: TPB constructs were positively associated with intention to follow social distancing guidelines. Fear of COVID-19 infection and prior social distancing behavior were positively associated with behavioral intentions. In contrast, perceived discrimination was negatively associated with the outcome. Associations between fear of COVID-19, perceived COVID-19 discrimination and behavioral intentions were partially mediated by constructs of TPB. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 prevention efforts designed to emphasize positive attitudes, perceived control, and social norms around social distancing should carefully balance campaigns that heighten fear of infection along with anti- discrimination messaging.","Frounfelker, Rochelle L; Santavicca, Tara; Li, Zhi Yin; Miconi, Diana; Venkatesh, Vivek; Rousseau, Cecile",Am J Health Promot,315,26

Experiences during pandemics in the 2000s, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-2-CoV-2, have highlighted concerns over the pressures that sustained respiratory virus pandemics may have on supplies of FFRs globally. Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance. Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far. Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination. Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings. Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels. The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however. Urgent regulatory body-supported research is required to endorse the routine decontamination of FFRs. In emergency settings, these methods should nevertheless be carefully considered as one strategy to address potential shortfalls in supplies of FFRs for healthcare workers.","Polkinghorne, A; Branley, J",J Hosp Infect,315,21

MA induced cytotoxic effects in cancer cells (IC50 42 µM), whereas no effect was found in A10 cells treated with MA (up to 210 µM). In order to produce a stress situation in cells, 0.15 mM H2O2 was added. Under stressful conditions, MA protected both cell lines against oxidative damage, decreasing intracellular ROS, which were higher in B16F10 than in A10 cells. The treatment with H2O2 and without MA produced different responses in antioxidant enzyme activities depending on the cell line. In A10 cells, all the enzymes were up-regulated, but in B16F10 cells, only superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase increased their activities. MA restored the enzyme activities to levels similar to those in the control group in both cell lines, highlighting that in A10 cells, the highest MA doses induced values lower than control.

RESULTS: In 2020, PHQ-9 score for loneliness, adjusted for covariates, was 3.23 (95% CI: 3.01-3.44), an increase of around 1 point on all previous years in this group and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.32). PHQ-9 was 2.60 (95% CI: 2.43-2.78) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of .5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.66, 95% CI: 1.56-1.75, similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the absolute burden of symptoms lower. CONCLUSION: After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","Creese, Byron; Khan, Zunera; Henley, William; O039,; Dwyer, Siobhan; Corbett, Anne; Vasconcelos Da Silva, Miguel; Mills, Kathryn; Wright, Natalie; Testad, Ingelin; Aarsland, Dag; Ballard, Clive",Int Psychogeriatr,315,32

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure. This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.","Holmes, Emily A; O039,; Connor, Rory C; Perry, V Hugh; Tracey, Irene; Wessely, Simon; Arseneault, Louise; Ballard, Clive; Christensen, Helen; Cohen Silver, Roxane; Everall, Ian; Ford, Tamsin; John, Ann; Kabir, Thomas; King, Kate; Madan, Ira; Michie, Susan; Przybylski, Andrew K; Shafran, Roz; Sweeney, Angela; Worthman, Carol M; Yardley, Lucy; Cowan, Katherine; Cope, Claire; Hotopf, Matthew; Bullmore, Ed",Lancet Psychiatry,315,16

The demand for intensive care unit capacity in particular has increased significantly, and hospitals in most affected regions have struggled to cope. The focus of health care activity has shifted to the pandemic, with a negative impact on the management of other conditions. Neurosurgery, like most specialties, has been drastically affected but, arguably, warrants special considerations because many of the treatments required are time-critical. Lack or delay of appropriate intervention may lead, for an individual patient, to permanent neurologic injury and a significant decline in function and quality of life, or even death. In this report, we consider the challenges that neurosurgeons currently face in relation to the pandemic and are likely to face in the foreseeable future. The challenges are multifaceted with practical, ethical, legal, and other implications. These include re-deployment of staff to areas outside neurosurgery, treatment priority setting, ethical decision-making and risk of moral injury, as well as medicolegal risks, financial uncertainties and implications for training, research, and global health work. As well as patients, these challenges will affect neurosurgeons as doctors and as humans. The international neurosurgical community has a moral duty to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 crisis, but also to retain a duty to care for individual patients.","Tsermoulas, Georgios; Zisakis, Athanasios; Flint, Graham; Belli, Antonio",World Neurosurg,315,5

These same systemic diseases have been associated with severe COVID-19 infections. Several recent studies have suggested hypotheses for the potential association between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19. Periodontal disease is also one of the most prevalent diseases globally. All this supports the importance of good oral health, also in the COVID-19 era. Thus, new strategies and approaches to identify patients at risk of periodontal disease could be beneficial to enhance secondary prevention, especially if targeted to COVID-19 risk groups. Diagnostic biomarkers for periodontal disease have been researched extensively. Potential biomarkers in oral fluid with currently available rapid non-invasive point-of-care technology, such as aMMP-8, could help to extend screening and identification of patients at risk for periodontal disease also to situations and places where professional dental expertise and equipment are limited or unavailable. i.e., nursing and care homes, and rural and distant places. The oral fluid point-of-care technologies could also be useful in the hands of medical professionals (diabetes, CVD, etc.) to identify patients at risk for undiagnosed periodontal disease and to refer them to a dentist for examination and evaluation. Finally, if there is a causality between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19 infections, these point-of-care oral fluid biomarker technologies could possibly also help in the assessment of the risk of deterioration and complications.","Räisänen, Ismo T.; Umeizudike, Kehinde A.; Pärnänen, Pirjo; Heikkilä, Pia; Tervahartiala, Taina; Nwhator, Solomon O.; Grigoriadis, Andreas; Sakellari, Dimitra; Sorsa, Timo",Med.

Methods An analysis was performed using Stata 15.0, and Q-test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the included studies. Results The most common symptoms were found to be fever (64.78%), cough (59.81%) and shortness of breath or dyspnea (23.86%). Of this 88.73% patients demonstrated typical COVID-19 signs on chest CT or X-ray. Intubation was carried out in 35.87% of patients, and 4.95% of mothers were admitted to the intensive care unit, where the rate of maternal death was <0.01% and that of premature delivery was 25.32%. The rate of the birth weight being <2,500 g was 30.65% and that of Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission was 24.41%. Positive nasopharynx swabs or sputum from newborns was <0.01%. Conclusions Pregnant patients with COVID-19 most commonly presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea, most of which possessed imaging manifestations. The risk of intubation and admission to intensive care unit were high. The risk of premature delivery was higher, leading to a high risk of NICU admission and low neonatal birthweight.

Here we compare per-patient imaging utilization, characterized by imaging studies and work relative value units (wRVUs), in an emergency department (ED) during a COVID-19 surge to the same period in 2019. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients presenting to the ED from April 1-May 1, 2020 and 2019. Patients were stratified into three primary subgroups: all patients (n = 9580, n = 5686), patients presenting with respiratory complaints (n = 1373, n = 2193), and patients presenting without respiratory complaints (n = 8207, n = 3493). The primary outcome was imaging studies/patient and wRVU/patient. Secondary analysis was by disposition and COVID status. Comparisons were via the Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-squared tests. RESULTS: The total patients, imaging exams, and wRVUs during the 2020 and 2019 periods were 5686 and 9580 (-41%), 6624 and 8765 (-24%), and 4988 and 7818 (-36%), respectively, and the percentage patients receiving any imaging was 67% and 51%, respectively (p < .0001). In 2020 there was a 170% relative increase in patients presenting with respiratory complaints. In 2020, patients without respiratory complaints generated 24% more wRVU/patient (p < .0001) and 33% more studies/patient (p < .0001), highlighted by 38% more CTs/patient.

Thus, 1,404 participants (977 women, 426 men, and one respondent preferred not to answer) ranging from 18 to 89 years old (36.4 +/- 11.7 year-old) completed a questionnaire in the period between 1st and 15th April 2021. The survey included sociodemographic data and the following validated instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine variation in anxiety levels and BPN satisfaction according to PA category (low, moderate, and high). Spearman's Rho correlations coefficients were used to determine the association between anxiety levels and psychological needs. Individuals presenting a higher level of PA revealed lower levels of anxiety-state (H = 20.14;p &lt; 0.01). Differences between elements from different levels of PA were found for the autonomy (H = 23.52;p &lt; 0.001), competence (H = 18.89;p &lt; 0.001), and relatedness (H = 24.42;p &lt; 0.001) psychological needs, suggesting that those who feel their BPN as more satisfied have higher levels of PA. The study found statistically significant correlations between anxiety-state and the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy (p = 0.01;r = -0.46), competence (p = 0.01;r = -0.40), and relatedness (p = 0.01;r = -0.21). These findings support the importance that PA has in the anxiety levels during social isolation, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary teams in an individual-based approach.","Antunes, R.; Rebelo-Goncalves, R.; Amaro, N.; Salvador, R.; Matos, R.; Morouco, P.; Frontini, R.",Frontiers in Psychology,315,30

Especially in cardiovascular diseases, ACE2, as a negative regulator of RAAS, is an extremely important protective factor that mainly plays a role by converting Ang â ¡ to Ang-(1-7). Nevertheless, with the recent outbreak of COVID-19, it was exposed that another identity of ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which previously served as the entry receptor for SARS. With the in-depth clinical research, it was found that the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 are related to cardiovascular disease, and SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptor is also potentially associated with heart injury symptoms. Therefore, in this article, we mainly review the relationship between ACE2, COVID-19 and cardiovascular system diseases/heart injury.","Li, Shuainan; Cai, Benzhi; Ma, Wenya; Yang, Fan; Xu, Yan; Xu, Binbin",Current drug targets (Print),315,20

Image retrieval is the task of extracting the visually similar images from a database for a query image. The feature matching is performed to rank the images. Various hand-designed features have been derived in past to represent the images. Nowadays, the power of deep learning is being utilized for automatic feature learning from data in the field of biomedical image analysis. Autoencoder and Siamese networks are two deep learning models to learn the latent space (i.e., features or embedding). Autoencoder works based on the reconstruction of the image from latent space. Siamese network utilizes the triplets to learn the intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity. Moreover, Autoencoder is unsupervised, whereas Siamese network is supervised. We propose a Joint Triplet Autoencoder Network (JTANet) by facilitating the triplet learning in autoencoder framework. A joint supervised learning for Siamese network and unsupervised learning for Autoencoder is performed. Moreover, the Encoder network of Autoencoder is shared with Siamese network and referred as the Siamcoder network. The features are extracted by using the trained Siamcoder network for retrieval purpose. The experiments are performed over Histopathological Routine Colon Cancer dataset. We have observed the promising performance using the proposed JTANet model against the Autoencoder and Siamese models for colon cancer nuclei retrieval in histopathological images.","Singh, Satya Rajendra; Dubey, Shiv Ram; Shruthi, MS; Ventrapragada, Sairathan; Dasharatha, Saivamshi Salla",,315,24

For the treatment of COVID-19, selective lung-localizing strategies hold tremendous potential, as SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung via ACE2 receptors and causes severe pneumonia. Similarly, recent reports have shown the association of COVID-19 with decreased 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and increased cytokine levels. This mechanism, which involves the activation of inflammatory NF-&#954;B- and SREBP2-mediated inflammasome signaling pathways, is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. To resolve those clinical conditions observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, we report 25-HC and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) nanovesicles (25-HC@DDAB) as a COVID-19 drug candidate for the restoration of intracellular cholesterol level and suppression of cytokine storm. Our data demonstrate that 25-HC@DDAB can selectively accumulate the lung tissues and effectively downregulate NF-&#954;B and SREBP2 signaling pathways in COVID-19 patient-derived PBMCs, reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. Altogether, our findings suggest that 25-HC@DDAB is a promising candidate for the treatment of symptoms associated with severe COVID-19 patients, such as decreased cholesterol level and cytokine storm.","Kim, Hyelim; Lee, Han Sol; Ahn, June Hong; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; An, Jiseon; Mun, Yong-Hyeon; Yoo, So-Yeol; Choi, Yoon Jung; Yun, Mi-Young; Song, Gyu Yong; Joo, Jinmyoung; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, Hong Nam; Park, Hee Ho; Lee, Jae-Young; Lee, Wonhwa",Nano Today,315,16

Numerous restrictions have been implemented in airline transport, which is potentially leading toward severe long-term impacts on the global airline industry. In this paper, air transport mobility was analyzed regarding Europe (EU) based on the available data from the relevant sources associated with the airline industry. Data were analyzed in specific periods from January to April of 2020, which corresponded with the initialization of the pandemic in the EU and later in its full development. Specifically, two airports were selected in Croatia as case studies to analyze the impact of COVID-19 more thoroughly on mobility together with the estimation of carbon footprint during the pandemic and the year before the pandemic state. The results revealed that COVID-19 gradually affected air transport mobility in the EU where a peak was reached in April with a reduction in the number of flights in the EU region reaching more than 89%. Cargo traffic was not significantly affected by the pandemic, and was even increased in some cases due to the supply of medical equipment in the fight against the disease. The analyzed case study revealed the reduction in air transport mobility for selected airports to be more than 96%, which directly affected the reduction of CO2emissions to factor 1.81 for the commercial airport of Zagreb and 3.49 for the seasonal airport of Split. A normalization of air transport mobility is expected to be reached through a 1-year period with a continued reduction in the number of flights ranging from 15% to 25%, based on the projections and expectations from relevant EU associations.","Nižetić, Sandro",Int.

Objective: To assess the effect of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted across 35 US sites. A total of 513 patients older than 40 years were randomized from August 2017 to June 2019 (final follow-up was January 2020). Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive antimicrobials (n = 254) or usual care alone (n = 259). Antimicrobials included co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice daily plus folic acid 5 mg daily, n = 128) or doxycycline (100 mg once daily if body weight <50 kg or 100 mg twice daily if &#8805;50 kg, n = 126). No placebo was administered in the usual care alone group. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was time to first nonelective respiratory hospitalization or all-cause mortality. Results: Among the 513 patients who were randomized (mean age, 71 years; 23.6% women), all (100%) were included in the analysis. The study was terminated for futility on December 18, 2019. After a mean follow-up time of 13.1 months (median, 12.7 months), a total of 108 primary end point events occurred: 52 events (20.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 14.8-25.9]) in the usual care plus antimicrobial therapy group and 56 events (18.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 13.2-23.6]) in the usual care group, with no significant difference between groups (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.71-1.53; P = .83].

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-systematic review in PubMed and the grey literature, as well as recommendations by a panel of stakeholders was made, regarding management, surgical considerations and follow-up of patients affected by lithiasis in the COVID-19 era. RESULTS: Under the current outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic scenario, patients affected by lithiasis should be prioritized into low, intermediate and high risk categories, to decide their delay and save resources, healthcare personnel, beds and ventilators. However, patients with potentially serious septic complications need emergency interventions. The possibility of performing or restarting elective activity depends on local conditions, the availability of beds and ventilators, and the implementation of screening protocols in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delaying lithiasis surgery and increasing waiting lists will have consequences and will require considerable additional effort. Teleconsultation may be useful in guiding these patients, reducing visits and unnecessary exposure. CONCLUSIONS: categorization and prioritization of patients affected by lithiasis is crucial for management, surgical selection and follow-up. Protocols, measures and additional efforts should be carried out in the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Socarrás, Moisés E Rodríguez; Esperto, Francesco; Bapstistussi, Marcelo Denilson; Barufaldi, Felipe; Vital, Matheus Soares; Papalia, Rocco; Salerno, Annamaria; Cataldo, Rita; Autrán-Gómez, Ana María; Scarpa, Roberto Mario",Int Braz J Urol,315,29

We investigated the potential of grapevine cv Askari in phytoremediation of heavy metal (HM) pollutions. In total 80 grapevine seedlings were exposed to four levels of HM stress (mild, low, moderate, and severe) in greenhouse condition during two growing years (2018 and 2019). The HM concentrations (Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Pb) were subsequently determined in the soils, roots, and grapevine aboveground parts (AGPs), and then phytoextraction and phytostabilization potential assessment indices, i.e., biological absorption coefficient (BAC), bioconcentration factor (BCF), and translocation factor (TF), were calculated. Results led to ranking of the cumulative concentration order of the HMs, i.e.: soils (3476.6) > AGPs (1418.8) > roots (562.2) mg/kg-DW. The mean concentrations ranking order of studied HMs were in soil: Cu (1184.8) > Pb (865.5) > Cd (803.2) > Cr (623.0) > Zn (277.9) mg/kg-DW; roots, Cu (242.0) > Cd (239.5) > Zn (188.8) > Pb (63.5) > Cr (17.2) mg/kg-DW; and AGP environments, Cu (910.2) > Cd (322.9) > Zn (160.3) > Pb (152.9) > Cr (25.3) mg/kg-DW. Principal component analysis results demonstrated the same distribution pattern for the studied HMs between soil, root, and AGP environments, and the highest correlation coefficients were found for Cu, Zn, and Cd. Based on the obtained results (Cu-BAC (> 1), Zn-BCF (> 1), Zn-TF (< 1), Cu-AGP mean concentrations (> 1000 mg/kg-DW), and Cd-AGP mean concentrations (> 100 mg/kg-DW)), it can be concluded that grapevine cv Askari possesses potentials for phytoremediation purposes of Cu, Zn, and Cd. These results were acquired in a greenhouse environment and under controlled conditions; we suggest that the phytoremediation potential of this grapevine variety be assessed in a contaminated vineyard environment as well.","Mirzaei, Mohsen; Verrelst, Jochem; Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi; Marofi, Safar",,315,1

In this context, the research aims to identify and classify development factors of such activity in regions described in the international scientific literature. We analysed works obtained from international (Scopus and Web of Science) and Russian (Elibrary.ru, journal websites) databases using the search terms “regional foreign economic activity”, “regional export”, “global challenges”, “export support”, “foreign investments”, etc. 143 Russian- and English-language articles and books published in the period 1980–2021 were chosen. Selected works, focused on Russian federal districts and regions, as well as advanced and emerging countries, describe various approaches to examining the specificity and development patterns of world regions. Based on the data, we performed structural analysis of foreign economic activity factors using the method of multi-parameter classification. The revealed factors were compared and divided into homogeneous groups with multilevel structures (macro-groups — groups — subgroups — individual factors). After analysing the variety of approaches, we identified five macro-groups of factors: 1) global challenges and partner country factors;2) resource, industrial, transport and infrastructure potential;3) organisational factors (finances, specialists’ skills, business community);4) investment, innovation and image potential;5) state support of foreign economic activity. The proposed classification considers the development of global, national, regional entities, as well as FEA participants and individuals, taking into account both direct and indirect factors. The research findings can be used for developing short-, medium- and long-term approaches, models and forecasts of regions’ foreign economic activity.","Lavrikova, Yuliya G.; Andreeva, Elena L.; Ratner, Artem V.",Ekonomika Regiona,315,16

METHODS: Students were emailed an electronic survey during their first semester and annually at the end of each academic year for a total of 3 years (2017-2020). Validated survey tools included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) student version. The JSE survey consists of 20 questions, with higher scores denoting more empathy. The MBI student version contains 3 subscales: exhaustion (higher scores are worse), cynicism (higher scores are worse) and professional efficacy (higher scores are better). RESULTS: The median JSE score at the end of the third academic year (PY3) was 110, with females scoring significantly higher (114.5 vs. 103.5; p<0.02). A majority of the 62 students reported burn out (82.3%), scoring in the highest category for either exhaustion (76%) or cynicism (55%). A majority (66%) also reported a low or moderate professional efficacy score, a negative finding. Measures of student burnout increased after the start of the program and remained at the higher level each subsequent year (p<0.0001). In the Spring of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every student had moderate or high levels of emotional exhaustion (97%) and cynicism (78%) as measured by the MBI. CONCLUSION: This interim data suggests high degrees of pharmacy student burnout. Empathy levels remained stable throughout the duration of the study. Pharmacy schools may need to focus on reform regarding well-being and prevention of burnout.","Jacoby, Jeanne L; Cole, Jaclyn D; Ruble, Melissa J; Smith, Amy B; Laubach, Lexis T; Greenberg, Marna Rayl; Macfarlan, Jennifer E; DeWaay, Deborah J; Barraco, Robert D; Shigo, Erin; Crowley, Lauren; Quinn, Joann Farrell",J Pharm Pract,315,24

The new sampling device, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that forced many countries to impose mandatory facemasks, allows an easy monitoring of the subject's exposure to different compounds they may come in contact with, actively or passively. The project combines the advantages of a fabric-phase sorptive membrane (FPSM) as an in vivo sampling device with a validated LC-MS/MS screening procedure able to monitor more than 739 chemicals with an overall analysis time of 18 min. The project involves the noninvasive in vivo sampling of the EBA using an FPSM array inserted inside an FFP2 mask. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers, and no restrictions were imposed during or prior to the sampling process regarding the consumption of drinks, food, or drugs. The FPSM array-LC-MS/MS approach allowed us to effectively exploit the advantages of the two complementary procedures (the convenient sampling by an FPSM array and the rapid analysis by LC-MS/MS), obtaining a powerful and green tool to carry out rapid screening analyses for human exposure to different compounds. The flexible fabric substrate, the sponge-like porous architecture of the high-efficiency sol-gel sorbent coating, the availability of a large cache of sorbent coatings, including polar, nonpolar, mixed mode, and zwitterionic phases, the easy installation into the facemask, and the possibility of sampling without interrupting regular activities provide FPSMs unparalleled advantages over other sampling techniques, and their applications are expected to expand to many other clinical or toxicological studies.","Locatelli, Marcello; Tartaglia, Angela; Ulusoy, Halil I; Ulusoy, Songul; Savini, Fabio; Rossi, Sandra; Santavenere, Francesco; Merone, Giuseppe M; Bassotti, Elisa; D039,; Ovidio, Cristian; Rosato, Enrica; Furton, Kenneth G; Kabir, Abuzar",Anal Chem,315,24

The review shows that, at present, antibodies have little use in the diagnosis of COVID-19 within the first seven days from onset of symptoms. However, as time progresses, the sensitivity of the antibody tests increases. Antibody tests are more useful in detecting previous COVID-19 infection if used 15 days or more from onset of symptoms.

Such a model could be a precursor to implementing smart lockdowns and vaccine distribution strategies. METHODS: The training cohort comprised 2337 COVID-19 inpatients from nine hospitals in The Netherlands. The clinical outcome was death within 21 days of being discharged. The features were derived from electronic health records collected during admission. Three feature selection methods were used: LASSO, univariate using a novel metric, and pairwise (age being half of each pair). 478 patients from Belgium were used to test the model. All modeling attempts were compared against an age-only model. RESULTS: In the training cohort, the mortality group's median age was 77 years (interquartile range = 70-83), higher than the non-mortality group (median = 65, IQR = 55-75). The incidence of former/active smokers, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic cardiac disease, chronic neurological disease, and chronic kidney disease was higher in the mortality group. All stated differences were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. LASSO selected eight features, novel univariate chose five, and pairwise chose none. No model was able to surpass an age-only model in the external validation set, where age had an AUC of 0.85 and a balanced accuracy of 0.77.

Apparently, measures like using face masks and social distancing were not observed by populace that ultimately worsens the situation. The behavioral response of the population induces a change in the dynamical outcomes of the pandemic, which is documented in this paper for all intents and purposes. The innovative perception is executed through a compartmental model with the incorporation of fractional calculus and saturation incident rate. In the first instance, the epidemiological model is designed with proportional fractional definition considering the compartmental individuals of susceptible, social distancing, exposed, quarantined, infected, isolated and recovered populations. By virtue of proportional fractional derivative, effective dynamical outcomes of equilibrium states and basic reproduction number are successfully elaborated with memory effect. The expansion of this derivative greatly simplifies the model to integer order while remaining in the fractional context. Subsequently, the memory effects on the asymptotic profiles are demonstrated through various graphical plots and tabulated values. In addition, the inclusion of saturation incident rate further explains the transmissibility of infection for different behavior of susceptible individuals. Mathematically, the results are also validated through comparative analysis of values with the solutions attained from fractional fourth order Runge-Kutta method (FRK4).","Abdul Razzaq, Oyoon Alam Khan Najeeb Faizan Muhammad Ara Asmat Ullah Saif",Results in Physics,315,17

This outbreak spread rapidly to the community through high-risk groups. This study describes the characteristics of the COVID-19 cases based on S religious group membership and summarizes Daegu City's processes and responses to control the outbreak. Methods: Epidemiologic characteristics of confirmed cases were obtained through basic and in-depth epidemiological surveys. General characteristics, asymptomatic proportion, case-fatality rates, and time-to-event within each group were presented after stratifying confirmed cases according to S religious group membership. Results: Overall, 7,008 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Daegu from February 18 to June 30, 2020, and 61.5% (n=4,309) were S religious group members. Compared with non-members, members had a higher proportion of women (p<0.001), younger age (p<0.001), and lower disease prevalence. Asymptomatic cases included 38.4% of members and 23.7% of non-members (p<0.001) at the time of the investigation. The case-fatality rate of non-members aged &#8805;60 years was significantly higher than that of members (p<0.001). Compared with non-members, the durations of symptom onset to diagnosis (p<0.001) and diagnosis to admission (p<0.001) of members were longer, whereas the duration of admission to discharge (p<0.001) was shorter. Conclusion: The epidemiologic features of S religious group members, including asymptomatic proportion, case-fatality rate, and time-to-event, differed from non-members. Daegu City prevented further spread of COVID-19 through immediate isolation and active screening tests of all S religious group members.","Kim, Jong-Yeon; Lee, Yu-Mi; Lee, Hwajin; Kim, Jung-Whan; Kim, Shin-Woo",Epidemiol Health,315,24

We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States. METHODS: Patients were recruited before breast surgery. Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP). Lymphedema was defined as a &#8805;10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery. HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4). Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status. RESULTS: A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments. The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P = .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score; P = .8777). At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P = .0825). However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P = .0002) and better emotional functioning (P = .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities. Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P &#8804; .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P = .0002), &#8805;1 positive lymph nodes (P = .0009), having no education beyond high school (P < .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P = .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P = .0007). CONCLUSION: The tested interventions did not differ in preventing lymphedema or in HRQOL outcomes.

Here, we compare the outcomes of a cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. METHODS: In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by age, sex and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, intensive care unit admission or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and the potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID-19 treatment, using logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 (IQR 53-78) years and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and CTD (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID-19 was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID-19 were increased age (OR 4.83; 95% CI 2.78 to 8.36), male sex (1.93; CI 1.21 to 3.07) and having a CTD (OR 1.82; CI 1.00 to 3.30). CONCLUSION: In hospitalised patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, having a CTD but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies was associated with severe COVID-19.","Pablos, Jose L; Galindo, María; Carmona, Loreto; Lledó, Ana; Retuerto, Miriam; Blanco, Ricardo; Gonzalez-Gay, Miguel A; Martinez-Lopez, David; Castrejón, Isabel; Alvaro-Gracia, José M; Fernández Fernández, David; Mera-Varela, Antonio; Manrique-Arija, Sara; Mena Vázquez, Natalia; Fernandez-Nebro, Antonio",Ann Rheum Dis,315,26

This binding requires the RBD to undergo a conformational change from a closed to an open state. In the present study, a key pair of salt bridges formed by the side chains of K537 and E619, residues at the interfaces of SD1 and SD2, respectively, was identified to promote the opening of the RBD. Mutations of K537Q and E619D reduced their side chain lengths and eliminated this pair of salt bridges; as a result, the opening of the RBD was not observed in the MD simulations. Thus, blocking the formation of this pair of salt bridges is a promising approach for treating novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). FDA approved drug molecules were screened by their capabilities of blocking the formation of the key pair of salt bridges, achieved by their positional stabilities in the cavity containing the side chains of K537 and E619 formed in the interface between SD1 and SD2.

To prioritize therapeutic regime against COVID-19, we used 61 antiviral drugs and their combinations. Selected molecules were subjected to virtual screening against: (i) human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding domain (hACE-2) which serves as an anchor for virus attachment and entry, (ii) SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for viral RNA replication, and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M-Pro) needed for viral polyprotein slab proteolytic processing.

The generalizability of this observation on ACS admissions and possible related causes in countries with low COVID-19 incidence are not known. HYPOTHESIS: ACS admissions were reduced in a country spared by COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study on the incidence rates of ACS-related admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak and the corresponding control period in 2019 in Greece, a country with strict social measures, low COVID-19 incidence, and no excess in mortality. RESULTS: ACS admissions in the COVID-19 (n = 771) compared with the control (n = 1077) period were reduced overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.72, P < .001) and for each ACS type (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]: IRR: 0.76, P = .001; non-STEMI: IRR: 0.74, P < .001; and unstable angina [UA]: IRR: 0.63, P = .002). The decrease in STEMI admissions was stable throughout the COVID-19 period (temporal correlation; R2 = 0.11, P = .53), whereas there was a gradual decline in non-STEMI/UA admissions (R2 = 0.75, P = .026) following the progressively stricter social measures. During the COVID-19 period, patients admitted with ACS presented more frequently with left ventricular systolic impairment (22.2 vs 15.5% control period; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction in ACS hospitalizations during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social measures, low community transmission, and no excess in mortality. Medical care avoidance behavior is an important factor for these observations, while a true reduction of the ACS incidence due to self-isolation/quarantining may have also played a role.","Papafaklis, Michail I; Katsouras, Christos S; Tsigkas, Grigorios; Toutouzas, Konstantinos; Davlouros, Periklis; Hahalis, George N; Kousta, Maria S; Styliadis, Ioannis G; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos; Pappas, Loukas; Tsiourantani, Fotini; Varytimiadi, Efthymia; Anyfantakis, Zacharias-Alexandros; Iakovis, Nikolaos; Grammata, Paraskevi; Karvounis, Haralambos; Ziakas, Antonios; Sianos, George; Tziakas, Dimitrios; Pappa, Evgenia; Dagre, Anna; Patsilinakos, Sotirios; Trikas, Athanasios; Lamprou, Thomais; Mamarelis, Ioannis; Katsimagklis, Georgios; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Naka, Katerina; Michalis, Lampros K",Clin Cardiol,315,1

Mental health is assessed by the validated PHQ-4 instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety. About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential implications of the virus for respondents' own health and social distancing also predicted increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic in the US, albeit less strongly. Our findings point towards the possibility of a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic, with economic concerns being a key driving force of this crisis.

However, few studies have sought to identify these factors. The present study had a double objective: (1) To identify the individual factors that differentiate patients who had been prescribed opioids for the management of chronic back pain from those who had not been prescribed opioids and (2) to determine which factors make significant and independent contributions to the prediction of opioid prescribing. Methods: A total of 675 patients from four primary care centers were included in the sample. Variables included sex, age, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and pain acceptance. Results: Although no differences were found between men and women, participants with chronic noncancer pain who were prescribed opioids were older, reported higher levels of pain intensity and depressive symptoms, and reported lower levels of pain-acceptance. An independent association was found between pain intensity and depressive symptoms and opioid prescribing. Conclusions: The findings suggest that patient factors influence physicians' decisions on prescribing opioids. It may be useful for primary care physicians to be aware of the potential of these factors to bias their treatment decisions.","Ramírez-Maestre, Carmen; Reyes-Pérez, Ángela; Esteve, Rosa; López-Martínez, Alicia E; Bernardes, Sonia; Jensen, Mark P",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),315,1

However, many particulars of the interactions between the two diseases are still unknown. This study aims to outline the main characteristics of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients, based on the experience of four high-volume COVID-19 hospitals in Northern Italy. METHODS: All cases of COVID-19 in-hospital patients undergoing duplex ultrasound (DUS) for clinically suspected DVT between March 1st and April 25th, 2020, were reviewed. Demographics and clinical data of all patients with confirmed DVT were recorded. Computed tomography pulmonary angiographies of the same population were also examined looking for signs of PE. RESULTS: Of 101 DUS performed, 42 were positive for DVT, 7 for superficial thrombophlebitis, and 24 for PE, 8 of which associated with a DVT. Most had a moderate (43.9%) or mild (16.9%) pneumonia. All venous districts were involved. Time of onset varied greatly, but diagnosis was more frequent in the first two weeks since in-hospital acceptance (73.8%). Most PEs involved the most distal pulmonary vessels, and two-thirds occurred in absence of a recognizable DVT. CONCLUSIONS: DVT, thrombophlebitis, and PE are different aspects of COVID-19 procoagulant activity and they can arise regardless of severity of respiratory impairment. All venous districts can be involved, including the pulmonary arteries, where the high number and distribution of the thrombotic lesions without signs of DVT could hint a primitive thrombosis rather than embolism.","Marone, Enrico M; Bonalumi, Giovanni; Curci, Ruggiero; Arzini, Aldo; Chierico, Simona; Marazzi, Giulia; Diaco, Domenico A; Rossini, Rosa; Boschini, Stefano; Rinaldi, Luigi F",Ann Vasc Surg,315,6

Here we present a dynamic ranking of host genes implicated in human betacoronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, seasonal coronaviruses). We conducted an extensive systematic review of experiments identifying potential host factors. Gene lists from diverse sources were integrated using Meta-Analysis by Information Content (MAIC). This previously described algorithm uses data-driven gene list weightings to produce a comprehensive ranked list of implicated host genes. From 32 datasets, the top ranked gene was PPIA, encoding cyclophilin A, a druggable target using cyclosporine. Other highly-ranked genes included proposed prognostic factors (CXCL10, CD4, CD3E) and investigational therapeutic targets (IL1A) for COVID-19. Gene rankings also inform the interpretation of COVID-19 GWAS results, implicating FYCO1 over other nearby genes in a disease-associated locus on chromosome 3. Researchers can search and review the gene rankings and the contribution of different experimental methods to gene rank at https://baillielab.net/maic/covid19 .

The development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could limit the morbidity and mortality caused by infection and may enable the relaxation of social-distancing measures. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for poor health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, it is desirable that any new vaccine candidates elicit a robust immune response in older adults. Methods: Here, we use in-depth immunophenotyping to characterize the innate and adaptive immune response induced upon intramuscular administration of the adenoviral vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD-1222) COVID-19 vaccine candidate in mice. Findings: A single vaccination generates spike-specific Th1 cells, Th1-like Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, polyfunctional spike-specific CD8+ T cells. and granzyme-B-producing CD8 effectors. Spike-specific IgG and IgM are generated from both the early extrafollicular antibody response and the T follicular helper cell-supported germinal center reaction, which is associated with the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies. A single dose of this vaccine generated a similar type of immune response in aged mice but of a reduced magnitude than in younger mice. We report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice. Conclusions: This study shows that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces both cellular and humoral immunity in adult and aged mice and suggests a prime-boost strategy is a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons.

Here we outline our approach to the resit virtual OSCE (""VOSCE"") for final year medical students that we undertook during ""lockdown"" in the current pandemic. METHODS: The original 'pre Covid' examination blueprint was reviewed and modified for the virtual environment in both format and content. In anticipation of the new format delivery, a number of pre-training sessions took place for all parties, and standardised templates were developed. RESULTS: A total of 9 students undertook the VOSCE, which took the form of a two-part exam (a communication and clinical examination component, and a practical procedures component). The VOSCE was completed by all students, examiners, simulated patients and invigilators on an online digital platform with no issues with regards to technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 6 students passed the VOSCE and as such progressed to graduation. The limitation of assessing some particular types of skills across the remote format (such as practical procedures) was recognised. The training and the templates developed were helpful in case the VOSCE format needs to be adopted in future at short notice and/or expanded in future.","Blythe, Jenny; Patel, Nimesh S A; Spiring, Will; Easton, Graham; Evans, Dason; Meskevicius-Sadler, Egle; Noshib, Hassan; Gordon, Heather",BMC Med Educ,315,12

Few studies have documented the relationship between the absence of labour companions and mistreatment of women during childbirth in low-income and middle-income countries using a standardised tool. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO multi-country study on how women are treated during childbirth, where a cross-sectional community survey was conducted with women up to 8 weeks after childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine whether labour companionship was associated with various types of mistreatment. RESULTS: Of 2672 women, about half (50.4%) reported the presence of a labour companion. Approximately half (49.6%) of these women reported that the timing of support was during labour and after childbirth and most of the labour companions (47.0%) were their family members. Across Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, women without a labour companion were more likely to report physical abuse, non-consented medical procedures and poor communication compared with women with a labour companion. However, there were country-level variations. In Guinea, the absence of labour companionship was associated with any physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.6, 1.9-6.9) and non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 3.2, 1.6-6.4). In Ghana, it was associated with non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 2.3, 1.7-3.1) and poor communication (AOR 2.0, 1.3-3.2). In Nigeria, it was associated with longer wait times (AOR 0.6, 0.3-0.9). CONCLUSION: Labour companionship is associated with lower levels of some forms of mistreatment that women experience during childbirth, depending on the setting. Further work is needed to ascertain how best to implement context-specific labour companionship to ensure benefits while maintaining women's choices and autonomy.","Balde, Mamadou Dioulde; Nasiri, Khalidha; Mehrtash, Hedieh; Soumah, Anne-Marie; Bohren, Meghan A; Diallo, Boubacar Alpha; Irinyenikan, Theresa Azonima; Maung, Thae Maung; Thwin, Soe Soe; Aderoba, Adeniyi K; Vogel, Joshua P; Mon, Nwe Oo; Adu-Bonsaffoh, Kwame; Tunçalp, Özge",,315,26

The purpose of this study was to investigate the network of components of pandemic-related negative psychological states (i.e., fear of infection, financial worries, loneliness) and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: Data from 10,061 Norwegian adults recruited through an online survey during a period of strict social distancing protocols were analyzed by cross-sectional network methods. RESULTS: Of the infection fears, fear of being infected, fear of dying from the coronavirus and fear of significant others dying from it had notable connections to the GAD symptoms anxiety and/or fear of awful events. The financial worry component worry about personal economy was connected to the MDD symptom sleep problems and to the GAD symptom generalized worry. Each of the loneliness components was connected to a specific MDD symptom. Depressed mood, low energy and worthlessness had the highest strength centrality among the MDD symptoms; generalized worry, uncontrollability of worry, and trouble relaxing among the GAD symptoms; fear of dying from the virus among the fear of infection components; and feeling isolated among the loneliness components. LIMITATIONS: Full random sampling was not conducted, although the sample turned out to be relatively representative of the Norwegian population.

METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted in 812 university students (mean age, 21.5±4.0 years). Participants were classified according to the number of hours the participants took online lectures into online students or in-person students. Respondents completed a total of three DED questionnaires (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI]; 5-item Dry Eye Questionnaire; 8-item Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire) and were surveyed on dry eye risk factors contemplated by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop II in addition to other factors potentially linked to dry eye. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-three subjects (64.4%) were classified into the online group and 289 (35.6%) into the in-person group. No statistically significant age (P=0.266) or sex (P=0.423) differences were found between groups. Students taking online lectures used the computer more, spent less time outdoors, practised more exercise, wore a face mask for less time, experienced fewer allergies and fewer psoriasis episodes, and obtained a higher OSDI score (P<0.029 for all). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the hours of online lectures taken per week was independently associated with having a positive OSDI score (P=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Taking online lectures is independently associated with having dry eye symptoms. Despite a lower prevalence of DED risk factors, a higher computer use is probably behind the greater ocular dryness reported by online students.","Talens-Estarelles, Cristian; García-Marqués, José Vicente; Cervino, Alejandro; García-Lázaro, Santiago",Eye Contact Lens,315,14

While COVID‐19 is often benign, a subset of patients develops severe multilobar pneumonia that can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no cure for severe COVID‐19 and few treatments significantly improved clinical outcome. Dexamethasone and possibly aspirin, which directly/indirectly target the biosynthesis/effects of numerous lipid mediators are among those options. Our objective was to define if severe COVID‐19 patients were characterized by increased bioactive lipids modulating lung inflammation. A targeted lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by tandem mass spectrometry was done on 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID‐19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. BALs from severe COVID‐19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acids and inflammatory lipid mediators. There was a predominance of thromboxane and prostaglandins. Leukotrienes were also increased, notably LTB(4), LTE(4), and eoxin E(4). Monohydroxylated 15‐lipoxygenase metabolites derived from linoleate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate were also increased. Finally yet importantly, specialized pro‐resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A(4) and the D‐series resolvins, were also increased, underscoring that the lipid mediator storm occurring in severe COVID‐19 involves pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory lipids.

Methods: Following expedited approval from our Institutional Review Board, we analyzed retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on a positive polymerase chain reaction testing at our institution from March 03, 2020 to April 7, 2020. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and patient-reported symptom data were collected at presentation in the emergency room. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between hospitalization and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Results: During this study period, we identified 207 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. 34.5% noted concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms; of which 90% of gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. In a multivariate regression model controlled for demographics and disease severity, an increased risk for hospitalization was noted in patients with any gastrointestinal symptom (adjusted OR 4.84 95% CI: 1.68-13.94]. Diarrhea was associated with a seven-fold higher likelihood for hospitalization (adjusted OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.49-20.02, P <0.001) and nausea or vomiting had a four times higher odds (adjusted OR 4.39, 95% CI: 1.61-11.4, P = 0.005). Conclusion: We demonstrate that a significant portion of COVID19 patients have concurrent mild gastrointestinal symptoms and that the presence of these digestive symptoms is associated with a need for hospitalization. With the current focus on streamlining triaging efforts, first responders and frontline providers should consider assessing for digestive symptoms in their initial clinical evaluation and decision-making.","Cholankeril, George; Podboy, Alexander; Aivaliotas, Vickie; Pham, Edward A; Tarlow, Branden; Spencer, Sean; Kim, Donghee; Hsing, Ann; Ahmed, Aijaz",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,315,26

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic practice and training in the UK. METHODS: Surgeons throughout UK hospitals were asked to complete an electronic survey relating to orthopaedic practice and training in their hospital. The nationwide survey was conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 cases in the UK between 20 March 2020 and 20 April 2020. RESULTS: All 202 UK participants reported disruption to their daily practice. 91% reported all elective operating had been cancelled and trauma continued as normal in only 24% of cases. 70% reported disruption to trauma operating. Elective clinic capacity significantly reduced with no elective clinics running as normal. 55% reported their elective clinics completely cancelled, whilst 38% reported elective clinics running at a reduced capacity, with non-urgent appointments postponed. Only 9% of fracture clinics ran as normal, and 69% had a reduced service. 67% reported teaching and study leave cancelled. Significantly, 69% of participants felt the pandemic would result in a delay to completion of registrar training programmes. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide survey assessing the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on UK orthopaedic practice and training, during the peak of the pandemic. It highlights the scale of the challenge ahead for the specialty, including during the recovery phase and post-recovery phase of the pandemic.

Body fluids unbalance is one of the main characteristics of this condition, as fluid overload is highly prevalent in patients affected by the cardiorenal syndrome. SUMMARY We describe the state of the art and new insights into body volume evaluation. The mechanisms behind fluid balance are often complex, mainly because of the interplay of multiple regulatory systems. Consequently, its management may be challenging in clinical practice and even more so out-of-hospital. Availability of novel technologies offer new opportunities to improve the quality of care and patients' outcome. Development and validation of new technologies could provide new tools to reduce costs for the healthcare system, promote personalized medicine, and boost home care. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a proper monitoring of chronic patients suffering from fluid unbalances is extremely relevant. Key Message: We discuss the main mechanisms responsible for fluid overload in different clinical contexts, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and heart failure, emphasizing the potential impact provided by the implementation of the new technologies.","La Porta, Edoardo; Lanino, Luca; Calatroni, Marta; Caramella, Elena; Avella, Alessandro; Quinn, Caroline; Faragli, Alessandro; Estienne, Luca; Alogna, Alessio; Esposito, Pasquale",Kidney & blood pressure research,315,24

The new situation gave rise to severe health threats, economic uncertainty, and social isolation, causing potential deleterious effects on people’s physical and mental health. These effects are capable of influencing oral and maxillofacial conditions, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism, which could further aggravate the orofacial pain. Two concomitant studies aimed to evaluate the effect of the current pandemic on the possible prevalence and worsening of TMD and bruxism symptoms among subjects selected from two culturally different countries: Israel and Poland. Materials and Methods: Studies were conducted as cross-sectional online surveys using similar anonymous questionnaires during the lockdown practiced in both countries. The authors obtained 700 complete responses from Israel and 1092 from Poland. In the first step, data concerning TMDs and bruxism were compared between the two countries. In the second step, univariate analyses (Chi(2)) were performed to investigate the effects of anxiety, depression, and personal concerns of the Coronavirus pandemic, on the symptoms of TMD, and bruxism symptoms and their possible aggravation. Finally, multivariate analyses (logistic regression models) were carried out to identify the study variables that had a predictive value on TMD, bruxism, and symptom aggravation in the two countries. Results: The results showed that the Coronavirus pandemic has caused significant adverse effects on the psychoemotional status of both Israeli and Polish populations, resulting in the intensification of their bruxism and TMD symptoms. Conclusions: The aggravation of the psychoemotional status caused by the Coronavirus pandemic can result in bruxism and TMD symptoms intensification and thus lead to increased orofacial pain.","Emodi-Perlman, Alona; Eli, Ilana; Smardz, Joanna; Uziel, Nir; Wieckiewicz, Gniewko; Gilon, Efrat; Grychowska, Natalia; Wieckiewicz, Mieszko",J Clin Med,315,1

About two decades ago, these cells were shown to play relevant roles in the therapy of numerous diseases, dependent on their immune regulation and their release of cytokines and growth factors, with ensuing activation of favorable enzymes and processes. Such discovery induced great increase of their investigation. Soon thereafter, however, it became clear that therapeutic actions of MSCs are risky, accompanied by serious drawbacks and defects. MSC therapy has been therefore reduced to a few diseases, replaced for the others by their extracellular vesicles, the MSC-EVs. The latter vesicles recapitulate most therapeutic actions of MSCs, with equal or even better efficacies and without the serious drawbacks of the parent cells. In addition, MSC-EVs are characterized by many advantages, among which are their heterogeneities dependent on the stromas of origin, the alleviation of cell aging, the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Here we illustrate the MSC-EV therapeutic effects, largely mediated by specific miRNAs, covering various diseases and pathological processes occurring in the bones, heart and vessels, kidney, and brain. MSC-EVs operate also on the development of cancers and on COVID-19, where they alleviate the organ lesions induced by the virus. Therapy by MSC-EVs can be improved by combination of their innate potential to engineering processes inducing precise targeting and transfer of drugs. The unique properties of MSC-EVs explain their intense studies, carried out with extraordinary success. Although not yet developed to clinical practice, the perspectives for proximal future are encouraging.","Racchetti, Gabriella; Meldolesi, Jacopo",Biomedicines,315,2

Therefore, the Spanish Obstetric Emergency group performed a multicenter prospective study on the vaccination status of Influenza and Tdap (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine boost administered in adulthood) in consecutive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pregnancy cohort, in order to assess its possible association with the clinical presentation and severity of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as to determine the factors that may affect vaccination adherence. A total of 1150 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women from 78 Spanish hospitals were analyzed: 183 had not received either vaccine, 23 had been vaccinated for Influenza only, 529 for Tdap only and 415 received both vaccines. No association was observed between the vaccination status and the clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or the severity of symptoms. However, a lower adherence to the administration of both vaccines was observed in the Latin-American subgroup. Based on the results above, we reinforce the importance of maternal vaccination programs in the actual pandemic.

Cranial nerve palsies are frequent in Guillain–Barré syndrome. Among cranial nerve palsies in Guillain–Barré syndrome, facial nerve palsy is the most common affecting around half of the cases. Facial palsy in Guillain–Barré syndrome is usually bilateral. We describe a pediatric Guillain–Barré syndrome variant presenting with unilateral peripheral facial palsy and dysphagia. A 5-year-old boy had progressive lower extremity weakness and pain 3 days prior to onset of unilateral peripheral facial palsy. On presentation, diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome was supported by areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. His condition deteriorated with a decline in his respiratory effort and inability to handle secretions. He was given non-invasive ventilation to prevent worsening of his acute respiratory failure. Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans showed enhancement of the left bulbar nerve complex and anterior and posterior cervical nerve roots with gadolinium. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin led to an uneventful clinical course with partial recovery within 2 weeks. In summary, Guillain–Barré syndrome should be considered as a possible cause of unilateral peripheral facial palsy. Guillain–Barré syndrome patients with facial nerve and bulbar palsy require close monitoring as they are at risk of developing acute respiratory failure. Early intervention with intravenous immunoglobulin may benefit these patients. Magnetic resonance imaging findings may lend support to early intervention.","Sharma, Kamal; Tengsupakul, Supatida; Sanchez, Omar; Phaltas, Rozaleen; Maertens, Paul",SAGE Open Med Case Rep,315,16

While several studies suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role, the key mediators of this process are yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that plasma from a high proportion (93%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not healthy controls, contains broadly auto-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM), and less frequently auto-reactive IgG or IgA. Importantly, these auto-IgM preferentially recognize primary human lung cells in vitro, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, analytical proteome microarray technology, and LDH-release cytotoxicity assays, we identify high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 260 candidate auto-antigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on the cellular membranes of pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues. These findings suggest that broad IgM-mediated autoimmune reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, thereby identifying a potential target for therapeutic interventions.","Ho Wong, Andrew Kam; Woodhouse, Isaac; Schneider, Frank; Kulpa, Deanna A.; Silvestri, Guido; Maier, Cheryl L.",Cell Rep Med,315,22

PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The WHO and CDC definitions of “influenza-like illness” are similar. However many studies use other definitions, some not specifying a temperature and requiring specific respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, making many samples non-comparable. Most ILI studies find less than 25% of cases are RT-PCR-positive, those which test for other viruses and bacteria usually find multiple other pathogens, and most identify no pathogen in about 50% of cases. ILI symptom and symptom combinations do not have high sensitivity or specificity in identifying PCR-positive influenza cases. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are increasingly used to screen ILI cases and they have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to RT-PCR in identifying influenza. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The working diagnosis of ILI presumes influenza may be involved until proven otherwise. Health care workers would benefit by renaming the WHO and CDC ILI symptoms and signs as “acute respiratory illness” and also using the WHO acute severe respiratory illness definition if the illness is severe and meets this criterion. This renaming would shift attention to identify the viral and bacterial pathogens in cases and epidemics, identify new pathogens, implement vaccination plans appropriate to the identified pathogens, and estimate workload during the viral season. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR). ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and in the operational definition of many surveillance databases and its imprecise definition may be inhibiting progress in research and treatment. The current ILI definition could with benefit be renamed “acute respiratory illness,” with additional definitions for “severe acute respiratory illness” (SARI) with RT-PCR testing for pathogens to facilitate prevention and treatment.","Thomas, Roger E.",Vaccine,315,26

We screened the fundus of patients with COVID-19 to detect alterations of the retina and its vasculature and to assess possible correlations with clinical parameters. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. The presence of retinal alterations in patients with COVID-19 and subjects unexposed to the virus was assessed using fundus photographs and their prevalence was compared. Mean arteries diameter (MAD) and mean veins diameter (MVD) were compared between patients and unexposed subjects with multiple linear regression including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking/alcohol consumption, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes as covariates. The influence of clinical/lab parameters on retinal findings was tested in COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: 54 patients and 133 unexposed subjects were enrolled. Retinal findings in COVID-19 included: haemorrhages (9·25%), cotton wools spots (7·4%), dilated veins (27·7%), tortuous vessels (12·9%). Both MAD and MVD were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to unexposed subjects (98·3 ± 15·3 µm vs 91·9 ± 11·7 µm, p = 0.006 and 138·5 ± 21·5 µm vs 123·2 ± 13·0 µm, p<0.0001, respectively). In multiple regression accounting for covariates MVD was positively associated with COVID-19 both in severe (coefficient 30·3, CI95% 18·1–42·4) and non-severe (coefficient 10·3, CI95% 1·6–19·0) cases compared to unexposed subjects. In COVID-19 patients MVD was negatively correlated with the time from symptoms onset (coefficient −1·0, CI 95% −1·89 to −0·20) and positively correlated with disease severity (coefficient 22·0, CI 95% 5·2–38·9). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 can affect the retina. Retinal veins diameter seems directly correlated with the disease severity.

NK ligand downregulation correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation by infected cells, and was overcome by antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA). Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in virus neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other viral proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D level in elite male collegiate athletes and to analyze its effect on body fat percentage. METHODS: We enrolled a total of 42 elite male collegiate athletes in this prospective cohort study. In March 2020, body composition monitoring and blood test were performed. All athletes were provided with vitamin D3 supplement tablets of 25g/day. The use of the supplement was dependent on athletes preference. During the study period, their club activities were stopped for 2months due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A second examination, similar to the first one, was performed after approximately 3months. Supplement usage by each athlete was also confirmed. The participants were divided into a non-supplement group (without supplementation, n=15) and a supplement group (with supplementation, n=27). RESULTS: Regarding baseline data at initial examination, the non-supplement and supplement groups showed significant differences in the mean body fat percentage (9.0% and 12.1%, respectively; P=0.03) and serum 25(OH)D level (22.7 and 18.5ng/mL, respectively, P=0.02). At the time of the second examination, there were no significant differences in the results of both the groups. In terms of mean change value from the first to the second examination, there were significant differences in body fat percentage (1.9 and 0.2%, respectively, P=0.02) and serum 25(OH)D level (1.7 and 7.2ng/mL, respectively, P<0.001) between the two groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change ratio of body fat percentage and change value of serum 25(OH)D level (r=0.37, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation of 25g/day significantly increased the serum 25(OH)D level in elite male collegiate athletes. Vitamin D supplementation may play a role in maintaining athletes body fat percentage under circumstances where sports activity has decreased.","Kawashima, Itaru; Tsukahara, Takashi; Kawai, Ryosuke; Mizuno, Takafumi; Ishizuka, Shinya; Hiraiwa, Hideki; Imagama, Shiro",Nutr Metab (Lond),315,14

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are just two of the most widely reported recent emerging infectious diseases. What are the factors that contribute to the rapid evolution of viral species? Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel). However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease. In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome. This latter finding markedly changes our concept of host–pathogen interactions and creates a new paradigm for the study of such phenomena.","Beck, Melinda A.; Handy, Jean; Levander, Orville A.",Trends Microbiol,315,21

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective and prospective study of pediatric patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at eight sites in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. RESULTS: We identified 281 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and divided them into three groups based on clinical features. Overall, 143 (51%) had respiratory disease, 69 (25%) had MIS-C, and 69 (25%) had other manifestations including gastrointestinal illness or fever. Patients with MIS-C were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic black compared with patients with respiratory disease (35% versus 18%, P=.02). Seven patients (2%) died and 114 (41%) were admitted to the ICU. In multivariable analyses, obesity (OR=3.39, 95% CI:1.26-9.10, P=.02) and hypoxia on admission (OR=4.01; 95% CI:1.14-14.15; P=.03) were predictive of severe respiratory disease. Lower absolute lymphocyte count (OR=8.33 per unit decrease in 10(9) cells/L, 95% CI:2.32-33.33, P=.001) and higher C-reactive protein (OR=1.06 per unit increase in mg/dL, 95% CI:1.01-1.12, P=.017) were predictive of severe MIS-C. Race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status were not predictive of disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified variables at the time of hospitalization that may help predict the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations in children and youth. These variables may have implications for future prognostic tools that inform hospital admission and clinical management.","Fernandes, Danielle M.; Oliveira, Carlos R.; Guerguis, Sandra; Eisenberg, Ruth; Choi, Jaeun; Kim, Mimi; Abdelhemid, Ashraf; Agha, Rabia; Agarwal, Saranga; Aschner, Judy L.; Avner, Jeffrey R.; Ballance, Cathleen; Bock, Joshua; Bhavsar, Sejal M.; Campbell, Melissa; Clouser, Katharine N.; Gesner, Matthew; Goldman, David L.; Hammerschlag, Margaret R.; Hymes, Saul; Howard, Ashley; Jung, Hee-jin; Kohlhoff, Stephan; Kojaoghlanian, Tsoline; Lewis, Rachel; Nachman, Sharon; Naganathan, Srividya; Paintsil, Elijah; Pall, Harpreet; Sy, Sharlene; Wadowski, Stephen; Zirinsky, Elissa; Cabana, Michael D.; Herold, Betsy C.",J Pediatr,315,29

One hundred and seventy professionally active health care workers took part in the study: doctors (n=41), nurses (n=114) and paramedics (n = 15). On average, study subjects were 37 years old and had 14 years of work experience. The following were used in this questionnaire-based study: General Health Questionnaire (GHQ–28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Mini-COPE – Coping Inventory. The research group experienced high levels of stress. Nurses experienced the most acute stress. Increasing stress levels are accompanied by an intensification of psychopathological symptoms (insomnia and depression). Older individuals and those with more years worked at work experienced less psychopathological symptoms. Non-adaptive stress coping methods (e.g. use of psychoactive substances) resulted in deteriorating mental health within the research group. Habitual use of non-adaptive strategies may bring relief in the short term in the form of reduced negative consequences of stress transactions and facilitate mobilisation or just sufficient performance at work. However, in the longer term, it may lead to deteriorating health. The obtained data shows that positive reinterpretation, age and length of work track record constitute protective factors against deteriorating health.","Ziarko, Michał; Jasielska, Aleksandra; Stanisławska-Kubiak, Maia; Daroszewski, Przemysław; Samborski, Włodzimierz; Mojs, Ewa",J Behav Health Serv Res,315,26

This paper compares several suppression approaches and potential exit strategies using a new extended epidemic SEIR model. It concludes that while rapid and strong lock-down is an effective pandemic suppression measure, a combination of other strategies such as social distancing, active protection and removal can achieve similar suppression synergistically. This quantitative understanding will support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions.

However, the cytoarchitectonic features, which determine neuronal network formation complexity, are unique to humans. This implies that the developmental program of the human brain and neurological disorders can only partly be reproduced in rodents. Advancement in the study of the human brain surged with cultures of human brain tissue in the lab, generated from induced pluripotent cells reprogrammed from human somatic tissue. These cultures, termed brain organoids, offer an invaluable model for the study of the human brain. Brain organoids reproduce the cytoarchitecture of the cortex and can develop multiple brain regions and cell types. Integration of functional activity of neural cells within brain organoids with genetic, cellular, and morphological data in a comprehensive model for human development and disease is key to advance in the field. Because the functional activity of neural cells within brain organoids relies on cell repertoire and time in culture, here, we review data supporting the gradual formation of complex neural networks in light of cell maturity within brain organoids. In this context, we discuss how the technology behind brain organoids brought advances in understanding neurodevelopmental, pathogen-induced, and neurodegenerative diseases.","Porciúncula, Lisiane O.; Goto-Silva, Livia; Ledur, Pitia F.; Rehen, Stevens K.",Front Neurosci,315,20

Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive group-testing approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCR-based diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.","Shental, Noam; Levy, Shlomia; Skorniakov, Shosh; Wuvshet, Vered; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Porgador, Angel; Hertz, Tomer",,315,23

Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far. METHODS: We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the number of cases and deaths due to the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. RESULTS: The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths will occur by the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithmic fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.","Amaku, Marcos; Covas, Dimas Tadeu; Coutinho, Francisco Antonio Bezerra; Azevedo, Raymundo Soares; Massad, Eduardo",Theor Biol Med Model,315,24

We hypothesized that engagement in these behaviors could provoke obsessions and phobias in vulnerable individuals in the community. METHODS: A total of 2117 participants, systematically selected to represent the age, gender, and race distributions of the US population, completed an online survey that assessed demographic characteristics, clinical features, COVID-19 risks, and COVID-19 contamination-prevention behaviors. Logistic regression was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the COVID-19 behavior score and clinically significant contamination obsessions, contamination compulsions, and pre-COVID-19 to current change in obsessive-compulsive symptom scores. RESULTS: The COVID-19 behavior score was significantly associated with contamination obsessions (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.12–1.16; p < 0.001) and contamination phobias (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.12–1.16; p < 0.001). The COVID-19 behavior score also was associated with pre-pandemic to current increase in the overall obsessive-compulsive symptom score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09–1.23; p < 0.001), as well as increase in obsessive-compulsive symptom score excluding washing items (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.07–1.19; p < 0.001). The magnitude of these relationships did not appreciably change, after adjustment for other variables associated with the outcomes. Moreover, the relationship was significant in those with or without OCD, and in individuals with different levels of doubt and COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSIONS: Contamination safety measures are critical for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the community. However, they may be related to the development of contamination-related symptoms and OCD in vulnerable individuals, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders during this period.","Samuels, Jack; Holingue, Calliope; Nestadt, Paul S.; Bienvenu, O.

Stress, pollution, diet, and gut microbiomes (alterable in weeks through dietary changes) have an intimate and bidirectional cause-effect relationship with CHRi. We propose that avoidance of CHRi-promoting foods and adoption of CHRi-suppressing foods could reduce susceptibility to HYPi, in Covid-19 and in other viral diseases, such as influenza, which are characterized by episodic and unpredictable HYPi.","Luthra-Guptasarma, Manni; Guptasarma, Purnananda",Bioessays,315,24

Despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data, particularly associated with indirect costs, from families during ARIs in children. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month cohort study in 234 preschool children with impact diary recording and PCR testing of nose-throat swabs for viruses during an ARI. We used applied values to estimate a virus-specific mean cost of ARIs. RESULTS: Impact diaries were available for 72% (523/725) of community-managed illnesses between January 2003 and January 2004. The mean cost of ARIs was AU$309 (95% confidence interval $263 to $354). Influenza illnesses had a mean cost of $904, compared with RSV, $304, the next most expensive single-virus illness, although confidence intervals overlapped. Mean carer time away from usual activity per day was two hours for influenza ARIs and between 30 and 45 minutes for all other ARI categories. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, community-managed ARIs are a significant cost burden on families and society. The point estimate of the mean cost of community-managed influenza illnesses in healthy preschool aged children is three times greater than those illnesses caused by RSV and other respiratory viruses. Indirect costs, particularly carer time away from usual activity, are the key cost drivers for ARIs in children. The use of parent-collected specimens may enhance ARI surveillance and reduce any potential Hawthorne effect caused by compliance with study procedures. These findings reinforce the need for further integrated epidemiologic and economic research of ARIs in children to allow for comprehensive cost-effectiveness assessments of preventive and therapeutic options.","Lambert, Stephen B; Allen, Kelly M; Carter, Robert C; Nolan, Terence M",Respir Res,315,1

Virus-infected, -activated monocytes also trigger feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic disease of felids typified by granulomatous (peri)phlebitis. Currently, the exact mechanisms inducing monocyte activation and FIP are unknown. This study attempted to identify the potential immediate effect of virulent FCoV on colony-stimulating factor (CSF) (granulocyte (G)-CSF, monocyte (M)-CSF and granulocyte-monocyte (GM)-CSF levels through in vitro assessment, alongside prototypical pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-10); this was assessed alongside the in vivo situation in the hemolymphatic tissues of cats euthanized with natural end-stage FIP. For the in vitro work, isolated monocytes from SPF cats were cultured short-term and infected with the FIP virus (FIPV) strain DF2. Mediator transcription was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) at 3, 6 and 9 h post infection (hpi), and in the post-mortem samples of bone marrow, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of cats with FIP. We observed limited and transient changes in cytokine transcription in monocytes after infection, i.e., a significant increase of IL-6 at 3 hpi and of GM-CSF over the 3 and 6 hpi period, whereas M-CSF was significantly decreased at 9 hpi, with a limited effect of age. The findings indicate that the infection induces expansion of the monocyte/macrophage population, which would ensure the sufficient supply of cells for consistent viral replication. In natural disease, the only upregulation was of G-CSF in the MLN, suggesting either immune exhaustion or an active downregulation by the host as part of its viral response.","Malbon, Alexandra J.; Michalopoulou, Eleni; Meli, Marina L.; Barker, Emi N.; Tasker, Séverine; Baptiste, Keith; Kipar, Anja",Pathogens,315,0

We enrolled consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure (ARF) who did not receive IMV at ICU admission. The primary outcome was the rate of IMV after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were death at day 28 and day 60, length of ICU stay and ventilator-free days at day 28. Data from the HFNO group were compared with those from the standard oxygen therapy (SOT) group using weighted propensity score. RESULTS: Among 138 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 62 (45%) were treated with SOT alone, and 76 (55%) with HFNO. In HFNO group, 39/76 (51%) patients received IMV and 46/62 (74%) in SOT group (OR 0.37 [95% CI, 0.18–0.76] p = 0.007). After weighted propensity score, HFNO was still associated with a lower rate of IMV (OR 0.31 [95% CI, 0.14–0.66] p = 0.002). Length of ICU stay and mortality at day 28 and day 60 did not significantly differ between HFNO and SOT groups after weighted propensity score. Ventilator-free days at days 28 was higher in HNFO group (21 days vs 10 days, p = 0.005). In the HFNO group, predictive factors associated with IMV were SAPS2 score (OR 1.13 [95%CI, 1.06–1.20] p = 0.0002) and ROX index > 4.88 (OR 0.23 [95%CI, 0.008–0.64] p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: High flow nasal canula oxygen for ARF due to COVID-19 is associated with a lower rate of invasive mechanical ventilation.","Bonnet, Nicolas; Martin, Olivier; Boubaya, Marouane; Levy, Vincent; Ebstein, Nathan; Karoubi, Philippe; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Van Der Meersch, Guillaume; Oziel, Johanna; Soulie, Marie; Ghalayini, Mohamed; Winchenne, Anais; Zahar, Jean Ralph; Ahmed, Passem; Gaudry, Stéphane; Cohen, Yves",Ann Intensive Care,315,28

Unfortunately classical neutralization assays are laborious, time-consuming and require an adequate biosafety level laboratory. Recently, convenient ELISA-based surrogate neutralization assays (sVNTs) for determination of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been developed. STUDY DESIGN: Our study compares the two novel ELISA-based SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assays “cPass SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit” (GenScript Biotech, USA) and the “TECO SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Assay” (TECOmedical, Switzerland) using 93 sera drawn from health care workers (HCVs) 2-3 weeks following the second vaccination with mRNA-1273 and 40 control sera from the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era before 2019 RESULTS: We found a sensitivity of 100% and 91,4% and a specificity of 100% and 100% for the GenScript assay and the TECO assay, respectively. Both sVNTs show a high correlation with anti-S IgG. Moreover, both sVNTs correlate well with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogate neutralization assays based on the RBD as bait feature a high specificity and sensitivity for identifying humoral neutralizing activity in individuals vaccinated with the spike-based vaccine mRNA-1273. Although these assays appear well-suited for confirming successful vaccinations with spike-based vaccines, additional studies should compare both assays regarding other purposes such as screening COVID-recovered patients or individuals vaccinated with inactivated whole virus vaccines.","Krüttgen, Alexander; Lauen, Maike; Klingel, Hanna; Imöhl, Matthias; Kleines, Michael",J Virol Methods,315,1

Methods - We retrospectively reviewed records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 evaluated by a consulting neurology team from March 30, 2020 through May 15, 2020. Results - Fifty-five patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included, 43 of whom showed encephalopathy, and were further divided into mild, moderate and severe encephalopathy groups. Nineteen patients (44%) had undergone mechanical ventilation and received intravenous sedatives. Eleven (26%) patients were on dialysis. Laboratory markers of COVID-19 severity were very common in encephalopathy patients, but did not correlate with the severity of encephalopathy. Thirty-nine patients underwent neuroimaging studies, which showed mostly non-specific changes. One patient showed lesions possibly related to CNS demyelination. Four had suffered an acute stroke. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in only one of 21 CSF samples. Two CSF samples showed elevated white blood cell count and all were negative for oligoclonal bands. In our case series the severity of encephalopathy correlated with higher probability of death during hospitalization (OR = 5.5 for each increment in the degree of encephalopathy, from absent (0) to mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3), p<0.001). Conclusion - In our consecutive series with 43 encephalopathy cases, neuroimaging and CSF analysis did not support the role of direct viral CNS invasion or CNS inflammation as the cause of encephalopathy.","Tuma, Raphael; Guedes, Bruno; Carra, Rafael; Iepsen, Bruno; Rodrigues, Julia; Filho, Antonio Edvan Camelo; Kubota, Gabriel; Ferrari, Maira; Studart-Neto, Adalberto; Oku, Mariana; Terrim, Sara; Lopes, Cesar; Neto, Carlos Eduardo Passos; Dalben, Matheus; Souza, Julia De; Baima, Jose Pedro; Silva, Tomas Da; Perissinotti, Iago; Martin, Maria da Graca; Goncalves, Marcia; Fortini, Ida; Smid, Jerusa; Adoni, Tarso; Lucatto, Leandro; Nitrini, Ricardo; Gomes, Helio; Castro, Luiz Henrique",,315,20

Although PMD is one of the most prevalent inborn errors of metabolism, it often exhibits marked phenotypic variation and can therefore be difficult to recognise. Current treatment for PMD revolves around supportive and preventive approaches, with few disease-specific therapies available. However, over the last decade there has been considerable progress in our understanding of both the genetics and pathophysiology of PMD. This has resulted in the development of a plethora of new pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies at varying stages of development. Many of these therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials. This review summarises the latest emerging therapies that may become mainstream treatment in the coming years. It is distinct from other recent reviews in the field by comprehensively addressing both pharmacological non-pharmacological therapy from both a bench and a bedside perspective. We highlight the current and developing therapeutic landscape in novel pharmacological treatment, dietary supplementation, exercise training, device use, mitochondrial donation, tissue replacement gene therapy, hypoxic therapy and mitochondrial base editing.

Policymakers tackling the coronavirus crisis have also been encouraged to prioritize policies which help mitigate a second, looming crisis: climate change. We identify and analyze policies that combat both the coronavirus crisis and the climate crisis. We analyze both the long-run climate impacts from coronavirus-related economic recovery policies, and the impacts of long-run climate policies on economic recovery and public health post-recession. We base our analysis on data on emissions, employment and corona-related layoffs across sectors, and on previous research. We show that, among climate policies, labor-intensive green infrastructure projects, planting trees, and in particular pricing carbon coupled with reduced labor taxation boost economic recovery. Among coronavirus policies, aiding services sectors (leisure services such as restaurants and culture, or professional services such as technology), education and the healthcare sector appear most promising, being labor intensive yet low-emission—if such sectoral aid is conditioned on being directed towards employment and on low-carbon supply chains. Large-scale green infrastructure projects and green R&D investment, while good for the climate, are unlikely to generate enough employment to effectively alleviate the coronavirus crisis.

High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed, nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay. METHODS: CCP donor serum collected by 3 US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. CoV2T prediction effectiveness at S/CO thresholds was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: 753 CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S/CO of 71.2 and median NT50 of 527.5. Proportions of CCP donors with NT50 over various target nAb titers were 86% [≥]1:80, 76% [≥]1:160, and 62%[≥]1:320. Increasing CoV2Ts reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below thresholds increased. As the targeted NT50 increased, the positive predictive value fell with reciprocal increase in negative predictive value. S/CO thresholds were thus less able to predict target NT50 titers. CONCLUSION: Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP. Product release with CoV2T assay S/CO thresholds must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives. A two-step testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with S/COs below thresholds.","Goodhue Meyer, E.; Simmons, G.; Grebe, E.; Gannett, M.; Franz, S.; Darst, O.; Di Germanio, C.; Stone, M.; Contestable, P.; Prichard, A.; Reik, R.; Vassallo, R.; Young, P.; Busch, M.; Williamson, P.; Dumont, L.",,315,20

STUDY DESIGN: Rapid review of articles published between January 2000 and May 2020. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), Health and Society Database (Informit) and Rural and Remote Health Database (Informit), and included studies undertaken in rural food environment settings in Australia and other countries. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria, including five conducted in Australia. Four of the Australian studies were conducted in very remote populations and in grocery stores, and one was conducted in regional Australia. All of the overseas studies were conducted in rural North America. All of them revealed a positive influence on food environment or consumer behaviour, and all were conducted in disadvantaged, rural communities. Positive outcomes were consistently revealed by studies of initiatives that focused on promotion and awareness of healthy foods and included co-design to generate community ownership and branding. CONCLUSION: Initiatives aimed at improving rural food retail environments were effective and, when implemented in different rural settings, may encourage improvements in population diets. The paucity of studies over the past 20 years in Australia shows a need for more research into effective food retail environment initiatives, modelled on examples from overseas, with studies needed across all levels of remoteness in Australia. Several retail initiatives that were undertaken in rural North America could be replicated in rural Australia and could underpin future research. CHAPTER 2: WHICH INTERVENTIONS BEST SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING NEEDS OF RURAL POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING NATURAL DISASTERS?: Objective: To explore and evaluate health and social care interventions delivered to rural and remote communities experiencing natural disasters in Australia and other high income countries. STUDY DESIGN: We used systematic rapid review methods. First we identified a test set of citations and generated a frequency table of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to index articles. Then we used combinations of MeSH terms and keywords to search the MEDLINE (Ovid) database, and screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved references. DATA SOURCES: We identified 1438 articles via database searches, and a further 62 articles via hand searching of key journals and reference lists. We also found four relevant grey literature resources. After removing duplicates and undertaking two stages of screening, we included 28 studies in a synthesis of qualitative evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four of us read and assessed the full text articles. We then conducted a thematic analysis using the three phases of the natural disaster response cycle. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of robust evaluation of programs and interventions supporting the health and wellbeing of people in rural communities affected by natural disasters. To address the cumulative and long term impacts, evidence suggests that continuous support of people's health and wellbeing is needed. By using a lens of rural adversity, the complexity of the lived experience of natural disasters by rural residents can be better understood and can inform development of new models of community-based and integrated care services. CHAPTER 3: THE IMPACT OF BUSHFIRE ON THE WELLBEING OF CHILDREN LIVING IN RURAL AND REMOTE AUSTRALIA: Objective: To investigate the impact of bushfire events on the wellbeing of children living in rural and remote Australia. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review completed using rapid realist review methods, and taking into consideration the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement for systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We sourced data from six databases: EBSCOhost (Education), EBSCOhost (Health), EBSCOhost (Psychology), Informit, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We developed search terms to identify articles that could address the research question based on the inclusion criteria of peer reviewed full text journal articles published in English between 1983 and 2020. We initially identified 60 studies and, following closer review, extracted data from eight studies that met the inclusion criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Children exposed to bushfires may be at increased risk of poorer wellbeing outcomes. Findings suggest that the impact of bushfire exposure may not be apparent in the short term but may become more pronounced later in life. Children particularly at risk are those from more vulnerable backgrounds who may have compounding factors that limit their ability to overcome bushfire trauma. CONCLUSION: We identified the short, medium and long term impacts of bushfire exposure on the wellbeing of children in Australia. We did not identify any evidence-based interventions for supporting outcomes for this population. Given the likely increase in bushfire events in Australia, research into effective interventions should be a priority. CHAPTER 4: THE ROLE OF NATIONAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS RURAL ALLIED HEALTH, NURSING AND DENTISTRY WORKFORCE MALDISTRIBUTION: Objective: Maldistribution of the health workforce between rural, remote and metropolitan communities contributes to longstanding health inequalities. Many developed countries have implemented policies to encourage health care professionals to work in rural and remote communities. This scoping review is an international synthesis of those policies, examining their effectiveness at recruiting and retaining nursing, dental and allied health professionals in rural communities. STUDY DESIGN: Using scoping review methods, we included primary research - published between 1 September 2009 and 30 June 2020 - that reported an evaluation of existing policy initiatives to address workforce maldistribution in high income countries with a land mass greater than 100 000 km2 . DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Emcare, Informit, Scopus, and Web of Science. We screened 5169 articles for inclusion by title and abstract, of which we included 297 for full text screening. We then extracted data on 51 studies that had been conducted in Australia, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Norway. DATA SYNTHESIS: We grouped the studies based on World Health Organization recommendations on recruitment and retention of health care workers: education strategies (n = 27), regulatory change (n = 11), financial incentives (n = 6), personal and professional support (n = 4), and approaches with multiple components (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Considerable work has occurred to address workforce maldistribution at a local level, underpinned by good practice guidelines, but rarely at scale or with explicit links to coherent overarching policy. To achieve policy aspirations, multiple synergistic evidence-based initiatives are needed, and implementation must be accompanied by well designed longitudinal evaluations that assess the effectiveness of policy objectives. CHAPTER 5: AVAILABILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH WORKFORCE DATA SOURCES IN AUSTRALIA: Objective: Many data sources are used in Australia to inform health workforce planning, but their characteristics in terms of relevance, accessibility and accuracy are uncertain. We aimed to identify and appraise publicly available data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review in which we searched bibliographic databases, websites and grey literature. Two reviewers independently undertook title and abstract screening and full text screening using Covidence software. We then assessed the relevance, accessibility and accuracy of data sources using a customised appraisal tool. DATA SOURCES: We searched for potential workforce data sources in nine databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Informit, the JBI Evidence-based Practice Database, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) and the grey literature, and examined several pre-defined websites. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the screening process we identified 6955 abstracts and examined 48 websites, from which we identified 12 publicly available data sources - eight primary and four secondary data sources. The primary data sources were generally of modest quality, with low scores in terms of reference period, accessibility and missing data. No single primary data source scored well across all domains of the appraisal tool. CONCLUSION: We identified several limitations of data sources used to describe the Australian health workforce. Establishment of a high quality, longitudinal, linked database that can inform all aspects of health workforce development is urgently needed, particularly for rural health workforce and services planning. CHAPTER 6: RAPID REALIST REVIEW OF OPIOID TAPERING IN THE CONTEXT OF LONG TERM OPIOID USE FOR NON-CANCER PAIN IN RURAL AREAS: Objective: To describe interventions, barriers and enablers associated with opioid tapering for patients with chronic non-cancer pain in rural primary care settings. STUDY DESIGN: Rapid realist review registered on the international register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) and conducted in accordance with RAMESES standards. DATA SOURCES: English language, peer-reviewed articles reporting qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies, published between January 2016 and July 2020, and accessed via MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, Informit or the Cochrane Library during June and July 2020. Grey literature relating to prescribing,deprescribing or tapering of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain, published between January 2016 and July 2020, was identified by searching national and international government, health service and peek organisation websites using Google Scholar. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our analysis of reported approaches to tapering conducted across rural and non-rural contexts showed that tapering opioids is complex and challenging, and identified several barriers and enablers. Successful outcomes in rural areas appear likely through therapeutic relationships, coordination and support, by using modalities and models of care that are appropriate in rural settings and by paying attention to harm minimisation. CONCLUSION: Rural primary care providers do not have access to resources available in metropolitan centres for dealing with patients who have chronic non-cancer pain and are taking opioid medications. They often operate alone or in small group practices, without peer support and access to multidisciplinary and specialist teams. Opioid tapering approaches described in the literature include regulation, multimodal and multidisciplinary approaches, primary care provider support, guidelines, and patient-centred strategies. There is little research to inform tapering in rural contexts. Our review provides a synthesis of the current evidence in the form of a conceptual model. This preliminary model could inform the development of a model of care for use in implementation research, which could test a variety of mechanisms for supporting decision making, reducing primary care providers' concerns about potential harms arising from opioid tapering, and improving patient outcomes.","Osborne, Sonya R; Alston, Laura V; Bolton, Kristy A; Whelan, Jill; Reeve, Erica; Wong Shee, Anna; Browne, Jennifer; Walker, Troy; Versace, Vincent L; Allender, Steven; Nichols, Melanie; Backholer, Kathryn; Goodwin, Nicholas; Lewis, Suzanne; Dalton, Hazel; Prael, Grace; Curtin, Michael; Brooks, Robert; Verdon, Sarah; Crockett, Judith; Hodgins, Gene; Walsh, Sandra; Lyle, David M; Thompson, Sandra C; Browne, Leanne J; Knight, Sabina; Pit, Sabrina W; Jones, Martin; Gillam, Marianne H; Leach, Matthew J; Gonzalez-Chica, David A; Muyambi, Kuda; Eshetie, Tesfahun; Tran, Kham; May, Esther; Lieschke, Gena; Parker, Vicki; Smith, Angela; Hayes, Christopher; Dunlop, Adrian J; Rajappa, Hema; White, Ruth; Oakley, Patrick; Holliday, Simon",Med J Aust,315,22

As a promising approach to address the emerging challenges caused by the epidemic of infectious diseases like COVID-19, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) deployed in hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers can save the diagnosis time and improve the efficiency of medical resources though privacy and security concerns of IoMT stall the wide adoption. In order to tackle the privacy, security, and interoperability issues of IoMT, we propose a framework of blockchain-enabled IoMT by introducing blockchain to incumbent IoMT systems. In this paper, we review the benefits of this architecture and illustrate the opportunities brought by blockchain-enabled IoMT. We also provide use cases of blockchain-enabled IoMT on fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, including the prevention of infectious diseases, location sharing and contact tracing, and the supply chain of injectable medicines. We also outline future work in this area.","Li, Xuran; Tao, Bishenghui; Dai, Hong-Ning; Imran, Muhammad; Wan, Dehuan; Li, Dengwang",Pervasive Mob Comput,315,20

The ensuing mental health issues are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers (HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline healthcare workers. Methods A survey questionnaire including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression - PSS 10, and DASS 21 was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering the first questionnaire and this continued as follow up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS Version 23 using various tests of significance. Results In the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion The high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers. Within the community, individuals suspected of having COVID-19 display a significant mental health burden, while HCWs also experience an unprecedented amount of stress during such enduring situations.","Parchani, A.; Vidhya, K.; Panda, P.

However access to these therapies is limited in low and middle income countries. Hence we performed an audit to identify accessibility, adverse event rates, compliance, progression free survival and overall survival in solid tumors. METHODS: This was a single center retrospective analysis of prospective data base of patients with non‐melanoma solid tumors who were treated with immunotherapy from August 2015 to November 2018. Adverse events during immunotherapy were documented and graded using CTCAE (Common terminology criteria for adverse events), v. 4.02. The response rates to immunotherapy, toxicities and the time to onset and resolution of toxicities were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Out of 9610 patients, only 155 patients (1.61%) could receive immunotherapy. The most common malignancies included metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, metastatic urothelial carcinoma and relapsed/recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Median overall survival in patients who received immunotherapy in non‐melanoma solid malignancies was 5.37 months (95% CI, 3.73–9.73). Poor performance status at baseline was the only adverse prognostic factor. The median progression free survival was 2.57 months (95% CI, 1.73–3.83). Immunotherapy was well tolerated with most common side effects being fatigue 14.8% and anorexia 5.8%. The cumulative incidence of immune related adverse events like hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis and nephritis was less than 10%. CONCLUSION: Real‐world data in Indian setting confirms the benefit of immunotherapy in patients with advanced non‐melanoma solid tumors.","Noronha, Vanita; Abraham, George; Patil, Vijay; Joshi, Amit; Menon, Nandini; Mahajan, Abhishek; Janu, Amit; Jain, Srushti; Talreja, Vikas T; Kapoor, Akhil; Kumar Singh, Gunjesh; Khaddar, Satvik; Gupta, Kushal; Rathinasamy, Narmadha; Srinivas, Sujay; Agrawal, Amit; Ventrapati, Pradeep; Prabhash, Kumar",Cancer Med,315,22

Outdoor recreation, such as rural second home tourism, provides extensive exposure to the natural environment, but research around health impacts of this exposure is scattered. We review current research on health and well-being impacts of nature and discuss how the characteristics of rural second home environments and their use and users can affect these potential impacts in Finland. We discover four key issues affecting the impacts. First, health and well-being impacts depend on the users; urban people can especially benefit from rural second homes, while child development and the performance of elderly people can also be supported by contact with nature at second homes. Second, the regularity, length and season of second home visits influence the potential to receive benefits as they have an impact on the intensity of nature exposure. Third, the type and quality of second home environment affect contact with nature, such as exposure to health-supporting environmental microbes. Fourth, practices, motives and meanings modify activities and attachment and crucially affect both physical and mental well-being. We conclude that rural second homes have extensive potential to provide nature-related health and well-being benefits and further research is needed.","Pitkänen, Kati; Lehtimäki, Jenni; Puhakka, Riikka",Int J Environ Res Public Health,315,1

However, it remains unclear if the disparity in mortality is due to gender differences in high-risk characteristics. Objective To study the clinical characteristics of a large and diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and determine the outcomes after matching for age and other high-risk characteristics. Design Retrospective cohort between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2020 Setting TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network consisting of multiple healthcare organizations (HCOs) predominantly in the United States Participants and Exposure A cohort of male and female patients > 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 identified with real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients from participating HCOs. A 1:1 propensity score matching of cohorts was performed for age, race, nicotine use, and all possible confounding comorbidities. Main Outcome Risk of mortality, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 Results A total of 5980 males and 7730 females diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. Males were significantly older than females (54.9 (18.3) vs. 50.9 (18.4), p-value <0.0001). There were significant differences in patient characteristics, but after propensity matching, both groups (N=5350 each group) were balanced. Males had a significantly higher risk for mortality both before (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and after matching (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Similarly, the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) was significantly higher in males even after matching. On subanalysis, males age > 50 had higher mortality than matched females of similar age (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), whereas the risk of mortality in matched groups < 40 years was similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.4-2.4). Conclusion In conclusion, males are more severely affected and have higher mortality from COVID-19. This gender-specific risk is especially more pronounced in advanced age. Gender disparity in poor outcomes can only be partially explained by differences in high-risk behavior and comorbidities. Further research is needed to understand the causes of this disparity.","Singh, S.; Chowdhry, M.; Chatterjee, A.; Khan, A.",,315,26

As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.","Yu, Q.; Davis, P.

Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. METHODS: Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against 14 key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. RESULTS: We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of 100–900 ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. CONCLUSION: Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control.","Fetissov, Sergueï O.; Hamze Sinno, Maria; Coëffier, Moïse; Bole-Feysot, Christine; Ducrotté, Philippe; Hökfelt, Tomas; Déchelotte, Pierre",Nutrition,315,24

Despite the development of vaccines, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the absence of effective therapeutics demand the continual investigation of COVID-19. Natural products containing active ingredients may be good therapeutic candidates. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of geraniin, the main ingredient in medical plants Elaeocarpus sylvestris var. ellipticus and Nephelium lappaceum, for treating COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to initiate virus entry into cells; viral entry may be an important target of COVID-19 therapeutics. Geraniin was found to effectively block the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 receptor in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, suggesting that geraniin might inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human epithelial cells. Geraniin also demonstrated a high affinity to both proteins despite a relatively lower equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) for the spike protein (0.63 μM) than hACE2 receptor (1.12 μM), according to biolayer interferometry-based analysis. In silico analysis indicated geraniin’s interaction with the residues functionally important in the binding between the two proteins. Thus, geraniin is a promising therapeutic agent for COVID-19 by blocking SARS-CoV-2’s entry into human cells.","Kim, Young Soo; Chung, Hwan-Suck; Noh, Sang Gyun; Lee, Bonggi; Chung, Hae Young; Choi, Jang-Gi",Int J Mol Sci,315,8

The pemphigus group consists of four main clinical types with several variants: pemphigus vulgaris (with pemphigus vegetans and pemphigus herpetiformis as variants), pemphigus foliaceus, paraneoplastic pemphigus and IgA pemphigus (with two clinical variants: intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis and subcorneal pustular dermatosis). Genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis, with HLA-DR4 (DRB1*0402) and HLA-DRw6 (DQB1*0503) allele more common in patients with pemphigus vulgaris, HLA class II DRB1*0344 and HLA Cw*1445 correlated with paraneoplastic pemphigus, and HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*04:06, HLA-DRB1*01:01, HLA-DRB1*14, associated with a higher risk of developing pemphigus foliaceus. Autoantibodies are conducted against structural desmosomal proteins in the skin and mucous membranes, mainly desmogleins, desmocollins and plakins. Cell-mediated immunity may also play a role, especially in paraneoplastic pemphigus. Patients may present erythema, blisters, erosions, and ulcers that may affect the skin, as well as mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, eyes, nose, leading to severe complaints including pain, dysphagia, and fetor. Oral mucosal postbullous erosive lesions are frequently the first sign of disease in pemphigus vulgaris and in paraneoplastic pemphigus, without skin involvement, making the diagnosis difficult. Treatment options classically include immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids and corticosteroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or dapsone. Newer therapies focus on blocking cell signaling events induced by pathogenic autoantibodies and/or targeting specific autoantibodies. The disease evolution is conditioned by the treatment with maximum doses of corticosteroids and the side effects associated with long-term immunosuppressive therapy, which is why patients need a multidisciplinary approach in following the treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical aspect, diagnosis and management of the main intraepidermal blistering diseases from the pemphigus group.","Costan, Victor-Vlad; Popa, Cristina; Hâncu, Mădălina Florina; Porumb-Andrese, Elena; Toader, Mihaela Paula",Exp Ther Med,315,1

Matériels et méthodes Étude sur 2 ans (2015–2016), prospective, observationnelle, incluant toutes les MIN, admises dans l’un des 21 centres de référence de la mort inattendue du nourrisson (CRMIN). Le statut vaccinal des nourrissons est défini comme « à jour » ou avec un « retard vaccinal potentiellement dangereux » selon les délais définis par Dubos et al., ou « non vacciné », ou « non en âge d’être vacciné ». Les prélèvements bactériologiques et virologiques des voies respiratoires ont été réalisés lors de l’admission en CRMIN et caractérisés par le site du prélèvement (aspirations nasales, poumons, plèvres) et l’existence d’un germe potentiellement pathogène. Résultats Les 127 nourrissons inclus avaient un âge médian au jour du décès de 103jours (IC±22,5). Sex-ratio de 1,4 (H/F). Pour le vaccin pentavalent, le vaccin anti-hépatite B et le vaccin antipneumococcique, le statut vaccinal moyen est « à jour » pour 46 % (n =59±0), « non vacciné » pour 13 % (n =16±3), « retard potentiellement dangereux » pour 1,8 % (n =2,3±0,4), « non en âge d’être vacciné » pour 31 % (n =40±0) Les données sont inconnues pour 8,2 % (n =10±0,1) des cas. Les prélèvements respiratoires virologiques sont positifs chez 26 % (n =33) des cas. Les 48 prélèvements respiratoires positifs identifient 44 % (n =21) de rhinovirus, 15 % (n =7) de bocavirus, 8 % (n =4) de coronavirus et d’entérovirus, 6 % (n =3) de VRS. Les prélèvements respiratoires bactériologiques sont positifs dans 32 % (n =41) des cas. Les 58 prélèvements respiratoires positifs rapportent 43 % (n =25) d’entérobactéries, 14 % (n =8) d’Haemophilus spp., 12 % (n =7) de Staphylococcus aureus, 10 % (n =6) de Streptococcus pneumoniae, 7 % (n =4) de Bordetella spp. Conclusion Ces premiers résultats chez des enfants admis pour MIN montrent une couverture vaccinale insuffisante (46 %) comparable aux données déjà rapportées dans cette population mais inférieure à celle de la population générale (60 % selon Vennemann et al.).

As reviewed herein, the T-cell response to vaccination requires a fine balance between the generation of inflammatory effector T cells versus follicular helper T (TFH) cells that mediate high-affinity antibody production in tandem with the induction of long-lived memory cells for effective recall immunity. During aging, we find that this balance is tipped where T cells favor short-lived effector but not memory or TFH responses. Consistently, vaccine-induced antibodies commonly display a lower protective capacity. Mechanistically, multiple, potentially targetable, changes in T cells have been identified that contribute to these age-related defects, including posttranscription regulation, T-cell receptor signaling, and metabolic function. Although research into the induction of tissue-specific immunity by vaccines and with age is still limited, current mechanistic insights provide a framework for improved design of age-specific vaccination strategies that require further evaluation in a clinical setting.","Gustafson, Claire E.; Kim, Chulwoo; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, Jörg J.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,315,1

Unlike other immunologically active polysaccharides, inulin has no immune activity in its native soluble form, but when crystallized into the stable delta inulin isoform, it acquires potent immune actions. Most notably, delta inulin enhances both humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine antigens, translating into enhanced protection against a broad range of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and toxin-mediated diseases. Delta inulin is distinct compared with typical vaccine adjuvants as it does not require adsorption to antigen and does not appear to work through induction of inflammatory danger signals. Delta inulin manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (referred to as Advax) has been proved to be safe and effective in human trials of influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, and insect sting allergy vaccines. Advax thereby represents a novel nonreactogenic immune modulator with potential utility across a broad range of human prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.","Petroski, N.",Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines,315,1

However, the temporal relationship of detecting virus-laden particles at nonhealthcare locations vs surveillance data obtained by conventional means has not been fully assessed. METHODS: From October 2016 to June 2018, air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong. Viral genomes were detected and quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of ecological and environmental factors associated with the detection of virus-laden airborne particles. RESULTS: Influenza A (16.9% [117/694]) and influenza B (4.5% [31/694]) viruses were detected at higher frequencies in air than rhinovirus (2.2% [6/270]), respiratory syncytial virus (0.4% [1/270]), or human coronaviruses (0% [0/270]). Multivariate analyses showed that increased crowdedness (aOR, 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5–3.8]; P < .001) and higher indoor temperature (aOR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.3]; P < .001) were associated with detection of influenza airborne particles, but absolute humidity was not (aOR, 0.9 [95% CI, .7–1.1]; P = .213). Higher copies of influenza viral genome were detected from airborne particles >4 μm in spring and <1 μm in autumn. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses that caused epidemics during the study period were detected in air prior to observing increased influenza activities in the community. CONCLUSIONS: Air sampling as a surveillance tool for monitoring influenza activity at public locations may provide early detection signals on influenza viruses that circulate in the community.","Xie, Chenyi; Lau, Eric H Y; Yoshida, Tomoyo; Yu, Han; Wang, Xin; Wu, Huitao; Wei, Jianjian; Cowling, Ben; Peiris, Malik; Li, Yuguo; Yen, Hui-Ling",Clin Infect Dis,315,24

Biosynthesis of the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) is pivotal in the resolution of inflammation via their roles in innate immune cells. Resolvin E4 (RvE4: 5S,15S-dihydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid) is a newly uncovered member of the E-series resolvins biosynthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) recently elucidated in physiologic hypoxia. This new resolvin was termed RvE4 given its ability to increase efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Herein, we report on the total organic synthesis of RvE4 confirming its unique structure, complete stereochemistry assignment and function. This synthetic RvE4 matched the physical properties of biogenic RvE4 material, i.e. ultra-violet (UV) absorbance, chromatographic behavior, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS(2)) fragmentation, as well as bioactivity. We confirmed RvE4 potent responses with human M2 macrophage efferocytosis of human apoptotic neutrophils and senescent red blood cells. Together, these results provide direct evidence for the assignment of the complete stereochemistry of RvE4 as 5S,15S-dihydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,13E,17Z-eicosapentaenoic acid and its bioactions in human phagocyte response.","Libreros, Stephania; Shay, Ashley E.; Nshimiyimana, Robert; Fichtner, David; Martin, Michael J.; Wourms, Nicholas; Serhan, Charles N.",Front Immunol,315,3

METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was done through PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to May 22, 2020, along with the reference list of all included studies. All cohort studies that reported on outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy were included. Qualitative assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Upon admission, most pregnant women underwent a low-dose radiation CT scan; the reports of which included unilateral/bilateral pneumonia in most patients. A marked lymphopenia was also noted in many patients with COVID-19. 513 titles were screened, and 22 studies were included, which identified 156 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 108 neonatal outcomes. The most common maternal/foetal complications included intrauterine/foetal distress (14%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The neonatal clinical manifestations of COVID-19 commonly included shortness of breath (6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (4%), and fever (3%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnancy leads to increased risk in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, and may possibly lead to maternal death in rare cases. There is no evidence to support vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the unborn child. Due to a paucity of inconsistent data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the newborn, caution should be undertaken to further investigate and monitor possible infection in the neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers.","Akhtar, Hubba; Patel, Chandni; Abuelgasim, Eyad; Harky, Amer",Gynecol Obstet Invest,315,5

Here, the anti-biofilm capacity of five bacteriophages was evaluated by a high content screening assay. We observed that biofilms were significantly reduced after phage treatment, especially in multidrug-resistant strains. Considering the anti-biofilm screens, two phages were selected as cocktail components, and the cocktail’s ability to prevent colonization of the endotracheal tube surface was tested in a dynamic biofilm model. Phage-coated tubes were challenged with different P. aeruginosa strains. The biofilm growth was monitored from 24 to 168 h by colony forming unit counting, metabolic activity assessment, and biofilm morphology observation. The phage cocktail promoted differences of bacterial colonization; nonetheless, the action was strain dependent. Phage cocktail coating did not promote substantial changes in metabolic activity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a higher concentration of biofilm cells in control, while tower-like structures could be observed on phage cocktail-coated tubes. These results demonstrate that with the development of new coating strategies, phage therapy has potential in controlling the endotracheal tube-associated biofilm.","Oliveira, Viviane C.; Macedo, Ana P.; Melo, Luís D.

While HCPs are expected to tackle this crisis by working in hospital and intensive care setting, there is real risk of them contracting infection and even dying. This article aims to report cases of healthcare personnel (HCPs) contracting COVID19 in various settings in a tertiary care hospital, a designated COVID centre, with view to disseminate information and review safety and psychological health issues of healthcare professionals. This study is a cross-sectional hospital-based survey from April 2020-June 2020. Data on demographics, workplace safety and psychological parameters from HCPs was collected by both interview and an online questionnaire form. A total of 40 healthcare workers were infected in the hospital in a period of 2 months since the first COVID case was admitted in the hospital. Almost 57.5% reported positive on several psychological parameters like anxiety, fear, anger, irritability and insomnia. About 42.5% had no psychological counselling after testing positive. These cases illustrate work-place risks for healthcare workers of acquiring COVID19 and highlight the problems faced in terms of risks of transmission to patients and colleagues, isolation of contacts in departments leading to near-breakdown of services and psychological stress to healthcare workers. Healthcare workers being at frontline of exposure to corona patients are at increased risk of developing COVID19 infections. Healthcare workers are working under tremendous stress in this pandemic and it is necessary to combat fear with facts and work towards safe work atmosphere so that they can discharge their duties to best of their ability.","Dabholkar, Yogesh G.; Sagane, Bhagyashree Ajit; Dabholkar, Twinkle Y.; Divity, Shivakumar",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,315,22

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","Carletti, Timoteo; Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco",,315,20

In this study, we evaluated the serum IL-10 levels and investigated its clinical relevance in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA). METHODS: IL-10 levels were determined in 21 patients diagnosed with SoJIA and 35 patients with fever diseases which were suspected as SoJIA, and IL-10 levels were compared between SoJIA patients with regard to disease activity, disease courses, and other biomarkers. RESULTS: Patients with SoJIA had significantly higher levels of IL-10 compared to patients with other febrile diseases. The serum levels of IL-10 were significantly higher in active SoJIA compared to inactive and positively correlated with known disease activity markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein level (CRP), ferritin (FER), and IL-6 levels. Moreover, the levels of IL-10 at diagnosis were significantly higher in SoJIA patients with a nonmonocyclic pattern than in patients with a monocyclic pattern. Compared to CRP, ESR, FER, and IL-6, IL-10 levels were superior in predicting monocyclic patients from nonmonocyclic patients. CONCLUSION: Compared to other febrile diseases, SoJIA patients have markedly higher levels of IL-10 which may assist with diagnosis. And a clear association of serum IL-10 levels with disease activity and disease courses in SoJIA was found. These results suggest that serum IL-10 might be a reliable clinical marker in SoJIA.","Peng, Yu; Liu, Xiaohui; Duan, Zhao; Duan, Junkai; Zhou, Yulan",Mediators Inflamm,315,16

Amid the well-documented threats to physical health, the effects of this public health crisis - and the varied efforts to contain its spread - have altered individuals’ “normal” daily functioning. These impacts on social, psychological, and emotional well-being remain relatively unexplored – in particular, the ways in which Chinese men and women experience and respond to potential behavioral stressors. Our study investigated sex differences in psychological stress, emotional reactions, and behavioral responses to COVID-19 and related threats among Chinese residents. METHODS: In late February (2020), an anonymous online questionnaire was disseminated via WeChat, a popular social media platform in China. The cross-sectional study utilized a non-probabilistic “snowball” or convenience sampling of residents from various provinces and regions of China. Basic demographic characteristics (e.g., age and gender) – along with residential living arrangements and conditions – were measured along with psychological stress and emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Three thousand eighty-eight questionnaires were returned: 1749 females (56.6%) and 1339 males (43.4%). The mean stress level,as measured by a visual analog scale, was 3.4 (SD = 2.4) - but differed significantly by sex. Besides sex, factors positively associated with stress included: age (< 45 years), employment (unsteady income, unemployed), risk of infection (exposureto COVID-19, completed medical observation), difficulties encountered (diseases, work/study, financial, mental), and related behaviors (higher desire for COVID-19 knowledge, more time concerning on the COVID-19 outbreak). “Protective” factors included frequent contact with colleagues, calmness of mood comparing with the pre-pandemic, and psychological resilience. Males and females also differed significantly in adapting to current living/working, conditions, responding to run a fever, and needing psychological support services. CONCLUSIONS: The self-reported stress of Chinese residents related to the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly related to sex, age, employment, resilience and coping styles. Future responses to such public health threats may wish to provide sex- and/or age-appropriate supports for psychological health and emotional well-being to those at greatest risk of experiencing stress.

Minimally invasive ultrasound-guided autopsy was performed with 14G core biopsies through a 13G coaxial needle. The protocol required 20 cores of the liver, 30 of lung, 12 of spleen, 20 of heart, 20 of kidney, 4 of breast, 4 of testis, 2 of skeletal muscle, and 4 of fat with total of 112 cores per patient. Quality of the samples was evaluated by number, size, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for COVID-19 and PCR-measured viral loads for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Five (5/60, 8%) patients were included. All approached families gave their consent for the minimally invasive autopsy. All organs for biopsy were successfully targeted with ultrasound guidance obtaining all required samples, apart from 2 patients where renal samples were not obtained due to atrophic kidneys. The number, size, and weight of the tissue cores met expectation of the research group and tissue histology quality was excellent. Pathology findings were concordant with previously reported autopsy findings for COVID-19.

The net excess number of deaths for weeks 10–23 was +8,071. The overall SMR was 1•03 (95%CI 1•03–1•04). The largest increase occurred among people aged 80–89 and 90+ (SMR=1•08 and SMR=1•09). A sensitivity analysis that accounts for demographic changes revealed an overall SMR of 0•98 (95%CI 0•98–0•99) and a deficit of 4,926 deaths for week 10–23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The excess mortality existed for two months. The favorable course of the first wave may be explained by a younger age at infection at the beginning of the pandemic, lower contact rates, and a more efficient pandemic management.","Stang, Andreas; Standl, Fabian; Kowall, Bernd; Brune, Bastian; Böttcher, Juliane; Brinkmann, Marcus; Dittmer, Ulf; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz",J Infect,315,16

In the last decade, many studies focused on the clinical usefulness of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the management of patients presenting with dyspnea from infective lung disease. We report data on the methodological and standardized use of bedside LUS in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute dyspnea from infective lung diseases. We performed a cross-sectional study in 439 patients (160 women and 279 men, mean age 64.2 ± 11.5 years, age range 23–91 years) with infective lung diseases. A bedside LUS with a convex probe and chest X-ray were performed in all subjects. Chest CT was performed in a subgroup of patients, as clinically needed. We observed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of pleural effusion and pulmonary consolidation assessed by LUS, compared to X-ray (52.7 vs. 20%, respectively, p < 0.05; 93.6 vs. 48.2%, p < 0.001). The majority of the consolidations detected by LUS were mixed, hypo- and hyperechoic, lesions, with air bronchogram in 40% of cases. All findings assessed by LUS were confirmed by chest CT, when performed. We describe the actual role of LUS in the assessment of patients with infective lung disease. It has higher sensitivity compared to chest X-ray in the detection of pleural effusion. Consolidations from infective lung disease have mostly mixed echogenicity by LUS.","Bracciale, Pierluigi; Bellanova, Salvatore; Cipriani, Cristiana",Front Med (Lausanne),315,20

Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause acute liver injury while serum detectability indicates systemic inflammation. AIMS: We explored a link between systemic IL-6, related acute phase proteins and liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 655 patients with suspected COVID-19 were screened in the emergency department at the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria, between February and April 2020. 96 patients (∼15%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. 15 patients required intensive-care treatment (ICT). Plasma aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transferase, as well as IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined by standard clinical assays. RESULTS: Of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 41 (42%) showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration. COVID-19 patients with elevated AST exhibited significantly higher IL-6 (p< 0.001), ferritin (p< 0.001), LDH (p< 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.05) serum concentrations compared to patients with normal AST. Liver injury correlated with systemic IL-6 (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), ferritin (p < 0.001) and LDH (p < 0.001) concentration. In COVID-19 patients requiring ICT, correlations were more pronounced.

We used a time-series epidemic model to estimate the ICU census in Daegu from the reported hospital data. FINDINGS: Multivariate regression analysis revealed male sex, old age, and residing in Daegu city as significant risk factors for ICU admission. The number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeded the bed capacity across all Daegu hospitals before March 9, 2020, and therefore, critically ill patients were transferred to nearby hospitals outside Daegu. This finding was consistent with our prediction that the ICU census in Daegu would peak on March 16, 2020, at 160 through mitigation efforts, without which it would have reached 300 by late March 2020.

METHODS: This retrospective study included 167 pregnant women who were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. The patients were divided into three groups according to the time of diagnosis as follows: <12 weeks of gestation (first trimester, n = 10), 12-24 weeks of gestation (n = 28), and >24 weeks of gestation (n = 129). Medical records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively and adverse pregnancy outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 49 (29.3%) patients had an active COVID-19 infection at the time of delivery, while 118 (70.7%) gave birth after the infection was cleared. Twenty-three patients had preterm birth and the gestational age was <34 weeks in only four of these patients. There was no significant difference in the preterm birth, PE, FGR, HELLP syndrome, and gestational diabetes mellitus among the three gestation groups (p = 0.271, 0.394, 0.403, 0.763, and 0.664, respectively). Four (2.39%) patients required intensive care unit stay. Maternal death was seen in only one (0.59%) patient. CONCLUSION: Our study showed no significant correlation between the gestational age at the time of COVID-19 infection and the frequency of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, PE, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of impaired mental well-being due to COVID-19 and explore associated factors. METHODS: The study was an observational, population-based, nationwide, cross-sectional online survey of a representative sample of the general Swiss population performed between March and April 2020. Participants reported on mental well-being, self-isolation/quarantine, their risk for developing severe COVID-19, and their work situation. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed risk factors for impaired mental well-being due to the pandemic. RESULTS: Data from 1022 individuals were analysed. The median age was 44 years (range 18 to 78) and 49% were women. A third of respondents reported that the COVID-19 pandemic impaired their mental well-being and almost half reported specific mental health concerns. Impaired mental well-being was associated with having health problems (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.29–2.74, vs no problems), being or living with someone at risk for severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1–1.9,), smoking (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.24–2.61), living in urban residential environments (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13–2.32, vs rural), not being able to work due to closed workplace (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.04–2.67), aged between 18 and 29 years old (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.32–3.01, vs 45 to 59 years old), and living in a single household (living with someone, OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44–0.97,vs single household). Overall, the most significant covariates of impaired mental well-being were specific mental health concerns: feeling depressed (OR = 7.21, 95% CI: 4.5–11.55), feeling less pleasure in doing things than before (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 4.1–9.62), feeling anxious (OR = 6.13, 95% CI: 3.91–9.59) and feeling lonely (OR = 4.08, 95% CI: 2.53–6.58). CONCLUSION: Impaired mental well-being can carry long-term consequences. We encourage policymakers to implement strategies to promote mental health during this pandemic situation. Special attention should be addressed to the youngest, those at risk for severe COVID-19 and those with government-imposed work restrictions.

Yet a substantial number of people have been resistant to wearing them. Considerable effort has been invested in convincing people to put on a mask, if not for their own sake than for those more vulnerable. Social and cognitive psychologists know that use and liking go both ways: people use what they like, and they like what they use. Here we asked whether positive attitudes towards facial masks were higher in those who had been wearing them longer. We asked participants in a diverse sample (N = 498 from five countries and more than 30 US states) to rate how attractive and emotionally arousing masks and other objects associated with COVID-19 were in comparison to neutral objects, as well as reporting on their mask-wearing habits. To confirm reliability of findings, the experiment was repeated in a subset of participants 8-10 weeks later. The findings show that regular use of protective masks was linked to their positive appraisal, with a higher frequency and a longer history of wearing a mask predicting increased mask attractiveness. These results extended to other COVID-related objects relative to controls. They also provide critical ecological validity for the idea that emotional appraisal of everyday objects is associated with our experience of using them. Practically, they imply that societal measures to encourage mask wearing may have contributed to positive emotional appraisals in those who put them on, whether due to personal choice or societal pressure.","Dudarev, Veronica; Manaligod, Maria Gm; Enns, James T; Todd, Rebecca M",Q J Exp Psychol (Hove),315,1

We examine the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress in ED clinicians working during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined psychological and physiological (sleep, resting heart rate, blood pressure) of a sample of frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: This was a sample of 52 clinicians (physicians, residents, nurses, PAs, NPs) who were frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic across a diverse (academic, community, urban, and suburban) range of four emergency departments in the New York Metropolitan area during July 2020-September 2020. Study design is a longitudinal prospective cohort design. At baseline, we conducted a psychological test battery including measures of COVID-19 related stress, PTSD (PCL-5), anxiety (GAD-5), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory). We also assessed home blood pressure at wake/sleep, resting heart rate, and sleep duration using an accelerometer watch device (Fitbit). Results: Baseline demographics in our sample had more self-identified women participants (62%), caucasian (67%), with median age of 42. Sample was diverse, containing physicians/advanced practice providers (45%) nurses (43%) and residents (12%) At baseline, positive screens for psychological symptoms were common;48% for acute stress, 37% for depressive, and 30% for anxiety symptoms. Overall, housestaff rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from attendings or nurses. Overall participants had elevated levels of emotional exhaustion on burnout surveys (median 24, SD 3.5). Average sleep duration was 6.2 hours (SD 1.3), resting heart rate of 86 (SD 18.2), and home blood pressure of 128/76. Increased levels of emotional exhaustion was positively associated with elevated resting blood pressure (Pearson r=.32), and resting heart rate (r=.38), while negatively associated with sleep duration (r=.23). Conclusion: Our preliminary work and others have highlighted that HCWs are experiencing significant COVID-19-related psychological and physical distress. Future work and data will address key questions such as whether such elevated distress symptoms remain persistent with the evolution of the pandemic. This work and others emphasize the need for continued mental health support measures for HCWs both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Chang, B.; Shechter, A.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,315,12

METHODS: We identified individuals of all ages with laboratory‐confirmed RSV from two sources, a community cohort undergoing surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and hospitalized patients from the same geographic area of New York City between 2013 and 15. The epidemiology, clinical features, and resource utilization (antibiotic/steroid/ribavirin usage, chest X‐rays, respiratory‐support (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), and indicators of disease severity (respiratory‐support, and/or ICU admission or death)) were compared among age groups using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: In the community cohort (1777 people with 1805 ARIs), 66(3.7%) tested RSV‐positive (3.8% of <1‐year‐olds; 3.8% of adults ≥65); 40.9% were medically attended, and 23.1% reported antibiotic usage. Among 40,461 tests performed on hospital patients, 2.7% were RSV‐positive within ± 2 days of admission (37.3% <1 year old; 17.4% ≥65 years old).

Most people attempt to minimize contact with others, and move themselves to avoid crowds. This dispersal may be adaptive regarding the intensity of media coverage and the population numbers in different patches. We propose an epidemic model with such adaptive dispersal rates to examine how appropriate adaption can facilitate disease control in connected groups or patches. Assuming dependence of the adaptive dispersal on the total population in the relevant patches, we derived an expression for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] to be related to the intensity of media coverage, and we show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text] and it becomes unstable if [Formula: see text]. In the unstable case, we showed a uniform persistence of disease by using a perturbation theory and the monotone dynamics theory. Specifically, when the disease mildly affects the dispersal of infectious individuals and rarely induces death, a unique endemic equilibrium exists in the model, which is globally asymptotically stable in positive states. Moreover, we performed numerical calculations to explain how the intensity of media coverage causes competition among patches, and influences the final distribution of the population.","Cheng, Chang-Yuan",Appl Math Model,315,32

However, little is known about a serious health-risk-behavior named “food and alcohol disturbance” (FAD), characterized by engaging in dysfunctional eating on days of planned alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential factors that may have put young adults at risk or protected against FAD during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A sample of 447 young adults (280 females, 167 males; range 18–26) completed an online survey during the country’s nationwide lockdown composed of self-reported measures assessing FAD behaviors, alcohol consumption, compensatory behaviors, eating and weight concerns, social support, emotion regulation strategies, and living arrangement. RESULTS: Our findings showed that FAD was significantly and positively correlated to alcohol consumption, use of laxatives, self-induced vomiting, eating and weight concerns, and expressive suppression, and negatively correlated to social support and living with family. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption, eating concern, and expression suppression positively predicted FAD, while social support and living with family were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that during the COVID-19 lockdown, preoccupation with eating and the use of expressive suppression may have increased vulnerability to FAD; conversely, perceived social support and living with family may have been a source of protection against this dysfunctional behavior.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, countries have implemented diverse policies regarding Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) measures. This is because in the first stage countries had limited knowledge about the virus and its contagiousness. Also, there was no effective medication or vaccines. This paper studies the effectiveness of the implemented policies and measures against the deaths attributed to the virus between January and May 2020. METHODS: Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the identified cases and deaths of COVID-19 from 48 countries have been used. Additionally, data concerning the NPI measures related policies implemented by the 48 countries and the capacity of their health care systems was collected manually from their national gazettes and official institutes. Data mining, time series analysis, pattern detection, machine learning, clustering methods and visual analytics techniques have been applied to analyze the collected data and discover possible relationships between the implemented NPIs and COVID-19 spread and mortality. Further, we recorded and analyzed the responses of the countries against COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in urban areas which are over-populated and accordingly COVID-19 has the potential to spread easier among humans. RESULTS: The data mining and clustering analysis of the collected data showed that the implementation of the NPI measures before the first death case seems to be very effective in controlling the spread of the disease. In other words, delaying the implementation of the NPI measures to after the first death case has practically little effect on limiting the spread of the disease. The success of implementing the NPI measures further depends on the way each government monitored their application. Countries with stricter policing of the measures seems to be more effective in controlling the transmission of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted comparative data mining study provides insights regarding the correlation between the early implementation of the NPI measures and controlling COVID-19 contagiousness and mortality. We reported a number of useful observations that could be very helpful to the decision makers or epidemiologists regarding the rapid implementation and monitoring of the NPI measures in case of a future wave of COVID-19 or to deal with other unknown infectious pandemics. Regardless, after the first wave of COVID-19, most countries have decided to lift the restrictions and return to normal. This has resulted in a severe second wave in some countries, a situation which requires re-evaluating the whole process and inspiring lessons for the future.

The purpose of this study is to assess IgG antibody responses following immunization with BNT162b2 (30 μg S protein) and mRNA-1273 (100 μg S protein) vaccines. A cohort of clinicians at a non-for-profit organization is being assessed clinically and serologically following immunization with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. IgG responses were measured at the Remington Laboratory by an IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-receptor binding domain. Mixed-effect linear (MEL) regression modeling was used to examine whether the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level differed by vaccine brand, dosage, or days since vaccination. Among 532 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants, 530 (99.6%) seroconverted with either vaccine. After adjustments for age and gender MEL regression modeling revealed that the average IgG increased after the second dose compared to the first dose (p<0.001). Overall, titers peaked at week six for both vaccines. Titers were significantly higher for mRNA-1273 vaccine on days 14-20 (p < 0.05), 42-48 (p < 0.01), 70-76 (p < 0.05), 77-83 (p < 0.05), and higher for BNT162b2 vaccine on days 28-34 (p < 0.001). In two participants taking immunosuppressive drugs SARS-CoV-2 IgG remained negative. mRNA-1273 elicited both earlier and higher IgG antibody responses than BNT162b2, possibly due to the higher S-protein delivery. Prospective clinical and serological follow-up of defined cohorts such as this may prove useful in determining antibody protection and whether differences in antibody kinetics between the vaccines have manufacturing relevance and clinical significance.","Montoya, José G.; Adams, Amy E.; Bonetti, Valérie; Deng, Sien; Link, Nan A.; Pertsch, Suzanne; Olson, Kjerstie; Li, Martina; Dillon, Ellis C.; Frosch, Dominick L.",bioRxiv,315,20

Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. Methods: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a hospital setting; and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a community setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the cost and impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgment. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters. Results: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 85%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 90% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. Conclusions: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and cost-effective, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.","Ricks, S.; Kendall, E.

This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis or affinity column- derived antibodies, both are sterilised and pathogen inactivated for substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This include for use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available. This would be a small step forward, while we are waiting to produce an effective, validated vaccine and witnessing increasing demands for testing and self-isolation which are the two most effective current strategies. In line with this concept, some methodological aspects of the use of the UVC sterilization of FFP/ cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against COVID-19 are highlighted. The plasmapheresis procedure is, of course, particularly targeted to male donors, who consist of about 75 % of the COVID-19 population and who are able to undergo multiple double, or even triple plasmapheresis procedures. Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT. Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selected COVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability. The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the two to 3 doses of viral inactivated antibodies, which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage. So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.","Seghatchian, J.; Lanza, F.",Transfus Apher Sci,315,22

It is known that the cross-linking agent used for preparation of biomacromolecule-based materials is as important as used biopolymer. Therefore, natural cross-linkers containing reactive carbonyl groups are of great interest especially for modifying properties of natural polysaccharides. One of the most popular cross-linking agents is glutaraldehyde. Nevertheless, the unreacted particles can be released from the cross-linked material and cause cytotoxic effects. This can be eliminated when using a cross-linker based e.g., on polysaccharides. This article describes quick and efficient synthesis of dialdehyde chitosan (DACS) and its application for the preparation of chitosan films. Materials obtained with different amount of DACS were fully characterized in terms of structure and surface morphology. Thermal and mechanical properties as well as hydrophilic character were also examined. The results obtained were compared with the materials obtained by cross-linking chitosan with low molecular weight glutaraldehyde and high molecular weight cross-linking agent based on polysaccharide–dialdehyde starch. Toxicity of all obtained materials was tested using the Microtox(®) test. It has been shown that due to better mechanical, thermal and surface properties as well as lower toxicity, dialdehyde chitosan is a very promising crosslinking agent.","Wegrzynowska-Drzymalska, Katarzyna; Grebicka, Patrycja; Mlynarczyk, Dariusz T.; Chelminiak-Dudkiewicz, Dorota; Kaczmarek, Halina; Goslinski, Tomasz; Ziegler-Borowska, Marta",Materials (Basel),315,20

Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be exploited to suppress CoV replication. We found that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types, (partially) restores the virus-induced translational shut-down, and counteracts the CoV-mediated downregulation of IRE1α and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide data sets revealed specific pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral state, including HERPUD1, an essential factor of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein degradation complexes. The data show that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism required for CoV replication, suggesting that thapsigargin (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs.

Moreover, a competitive assay was performed to check for cross reactivity response between COV2-SPIKE(421–434) and NL63-RBM3 among patients with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Immune reaction against all SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 epitopes showed a significantly higher response in pre-pandemic patients compared to mid-pandemic patients. The results indicate that probably antibodies against HCoV-NL63 may be able to cross react with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the higher incidence in pre-pandemic was probably due to the timing of collection when a high incidence of HCoV-NL63 is reported. In addition, the competitive assay showed cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against COV2-SPIKE(421–434) and NL63-RBM3 peptides. Pre-existing HCoV-NL63 antibody response cross reacting with SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in both pre- and mid-pandemic individual, suggesting that previous exposure to HCoV-NL63 epitopes may produce antibodies which could confer a protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and probably reduce the severity of the disease.","Simula, Elena Rita; Manca, Maria Antonietta; Jasemi, Seyedsomaye; Uzzau, Sergio; Rubino, Salvatore; Manchia, Pierangela; Bitti, Angela; Palermo, Mario; Sechi, Leonardo A.",Microorganisms,315,20

The present study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of host selenoproteins which mediate many beneficial actions of selenium. We found that SARS-CoV-2 suppressed mRNA expression of selenoproteins associated with ferroptosis (GPX4), endoplasmic reticulum stress (SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS) and DNA synthesis (TXNRD3), while SARS-CoV-2 increased gene expression of IL-6 (an inflammatory cytokine positively correlated with severity of COVID-19), in Vero cells.

This study investigated whether LoC I and LoC E moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in the general population during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study analysed data from a Norwegian (n = 1225) and a German-speaking sample (n = 1527). We measured LoC with the Locus of Control-4 Scale (IE-4), COVID-19 stress with a scale developed for this purpose, and mental distress with the Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4). Moderation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. RESULTS: The association between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress was strong (r = .61 and r = .55 for the Norwegian and the German-speaking sample, respectively). In both samples, LoC showed substantial moderation effects. LoC I served as a buffer (p < .001), and LoC E exacerbated (p < .001) the relation between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is easier to bear for people who, despite pandemic-related strains, feel that they generally have influence over their own lives. An external locus of control, conversely, is associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The prevention of mental distress may be supported by enabling a sense of control through citizen participation in policy decisions and transparent explanation in their implementation.

Previous studies have demonstrated individual variation in core body temperature with factors such as age, gender, circadian rhythm, menstruation, and energy expenditure;however, it is unknown whether ambient temperature affects the host ability to mount a fever. The possibility of a systematic change in body temperature during different seasons of the year has implications throughout healthcare. Using 100.4°F as the cut-off for fever regardless of ambient temperature may result in poor sensitivity in screening for infections. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to four different hospitals for COVID-19 from 03/01/2020-02/28/2021. The 24-hour mean ambient temperature as well as the 72-hour mean ambient temperature was correlated with the percentage of patients who presented with fever. Fever was defined as maximum oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4°F within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Ambient temperature was stratified into deciles. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of ambient temperature with fever, controlling for demographics and comorbidities (congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and liver disease). RESULTS: 5,275 patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 61 years, 49.7% (2622) were female, and the mortality rate was 8.7%. There was a linear relationship between the ambient temperature and the sensitivity of the 100.4°F fever cut-off (i.e., the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 increased with increasing ambient temperature). In the coldest decile of ambient temperatures (<42.6°F), only 13% of COVID-19 patients presented with a fever compared to 25% in the highest decile of ambient temperature (>79.8°F). When controlling for demographics and comorbidities, the odds ratio of presenting with fever increased by 13% for every 10°F increase in ambient temperature (OR 1.13, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ambient temperature affects the sensitivity of fever in detecting COVID-19, with increased sensitivity at higher ambient temperature. The one-size-fits-all fever cut-off may not adequately detect viral infections in different locations and climates. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that ambient temperature exposure should be taken into consideration when screening for infection. Lower cut-offs for fever may be required in screening patients during the winter season or in colder climates.

We found that the abnormalities of CDR-H3 length, hydrophobicity, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and germ line index were progressively more prominent in patients with MN, and the frequency of IGHV3-66 in post-therapy patients was significantly lower than that in pre-therapy patients. Moreover, we found that the IGHV3-38 gene was significantly related to PLA2R, which is the most commonly used biomarker. The most important discovery was that several IGHV, IGHD transcripts, CDR-H3 length, and SHM rate in pre-therapy patients had the potential to predict the therapeutic effect.

Healthcare professionals have responded by embarking on a concerted search for therapies to cure and prevent COVID-19. Recently, interferon (IFN) has emerged as a potential therapy as it is associated with reducing lung inflammation and suppressing viral replication. This research paper assessed the efficacy of high-dose nebulized IFN α 2b in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. It commenced on April 9 and ended on June 17, 2020. Researchers selected participants from hospitalized patients aged 18 years and above who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Other inclusion criteria were bilateral pneumonia on lung or chest X-ray scan and severe respiratory distress. SMART-COP, which is a risk stratification scoring tool, and radiologic severity index (RSI) were used to assess pneumonia severity. Patients in the treatment cohort received nebulized IFN α 2b at a dose of 10 million IU every 12 hours for 5 days, in addition to standard treatment. Patients in the control cohort received standard treatment only. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria;37 were included in the treatment cohort and 36 in the control cohort. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 14 of 36 (38.9%) patients in the control cohort, compared with 6 of 37 (27.4%) patients in the treatment cohort (HR 5.62 [95% CI 1.81-17.48];P = .003). For pneumonia severity, there was a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.72 [95% CI 1.74- 7.98];P = ·.01. After 5 days of treatment, chest X-rays indicated significant beneficial changes in the treatment group (HR 2.24 [CI 1.05- 4.79];P = .036). Multivariate analysis revealed that pneumonia severity and RSI remained higher in the control group. The HR was 3.44 [95% CI 1.49-7.94];P = .004 and 2.26 [95% CI 0.99-5.16];P = .05, respectively. There was an increase in liver aminotransferases in 5 (14%) participants in the control cohort and 3 (8%) participants in the treatment cohort. CONCLUSION: High-dose nebulized IFN α 2b has potential efficacy in mitigating severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study established that administering high-dose nebulized IFN α 2b significantly reduces pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. We also found a strong relationship between using nebulized IFN α 2b and reduced need for mechanical ventilation among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, a well-designed control trial is needed to confirm the drug's efficacy in reducing the COVID-19 pneumonia severity.","Chkhis, Ayman Najiba Abdulrazzaq Mokhtar Sherif Alia Al Jasmi",Turk Toraks Dergisi,315,33

More strikingly, the survival rate of diabetic patients is also much lower than in non-diabetic patients. In addition to the general damage of high glucose to cells and tissues, a recent discovery that high glucose activates interferon regulatory factor 15 promotes influenza virus -induced cytokine storm. This discovery may shed light on the high incidence of diabetes in COVID-19.

They serve as front-line staff, but are trainees, regulated by duty hour and supervision restrictions. Heightened oversight is necessary to ensure resident supervision and safety whilst mobilizing this important workforce during crisis. This manuscript describes the development and implementation of an institutional crisis dashboard to facilitate timely information gathering and decision-making regarding resident activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to develop an intelligent graduate medical education dashboard to centralize and integrate data to support accurate, timely decisions in several areas: (1) track redeployment; (2) ensure adherence to supervision and duty hour regulations; and (3) monitor infection control and safety measures. METHODS: The dashboard is a live Microsoft Excel database saved to a shared fileserver. All existing databases within the education department were reviewed to form a foundational template. A monitoring section provides at-a-glance information on trainee assignments. Embedded color-coded flags attached to specific responses immediately highlight areas of deficiency. RESULTS: The dashboard facilitated the efficient mobilization of trainees, while ensuring assignments followed education regulations. It allowed the education office to centralize and proactively arrange mass scrubs orders, facemask fitting, and personal protective equipment training. It was a monitoring system that enabled recognition of safety concerns in real-time, including identifying areas where residents were most exposed or infected. CONCLUSION: The dashboard improved the efficiency of crisis response, while prioritizing resident safety. It is feasible, low cost and easily accessible, even during Internet disruption. It can be used by hospitals worldwide, including low resource settings.","Kiernan, Kellie L.; Al Fahim, Maha; Harhara, Thana; Nair, Satish Chandrasekhar; Ibrahim, Halah",Acta Inform Med,315,16

Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients.

To this end, we evaluated face processing abilities for masked and unmasked faces in a large online sample of adult observers (n = 496) using an adapted version of the Cambridge Face Memory Test, a validated measure of face perception abilities in humans. As expected, a substantial decrease in performance was found for masked faces. Importantly, the inclusion of masks also led to a qualitative change in the way masked faces are perceived. In particular, holistic processing, the hallmark of face perception, was disrupted for faces with masks, as suggested by a reduced inversion effect. Similar changes were found whether masks were included during the study or the test phases of the experiment. Together, we provide novel evidence for quantitative and qualitative alterations in the processing of masked faces that could have significant effects on daily activities and social interactions.","Freud, Erez; Stajduhar, Andreja; Rosenbaum, R.

The Berlin University Children's Hospital at Charité (BCH) had to ensure treatment for children not infected and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prevention of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients and staff was a paramount goal. Pediatric hospitals worldwide discontinued elective treatments and established a centralized admission process. Methods: The response of BCH to the pandemic adapted to emerging evidence. This resulted in centralized admission via one ward exclusively dedicated to children with unclear SARS-CoV-2 status and discontinuation of elective treatment during the first wave, but maintenance of elective care and decentralized admissions during the second wave. We report numbers of patients treated and of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two waves of the pandemic. Results: During the first wave, weekly numbers of inpatient and outpatient cases declined by 37% (p < 0.001) and 29% (p = 0.003), respectively. During the second wave, however, inpatient case numbers were 7% higher (p = 0.06) and outpatient case numbers only 6% lower (p = 0.25), compared to the previous year. Only a minority of inpatients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (0.47% during the first, 0.63% during the second wave). No nosocomial infection of pediatric patients by SARS-CoV-2 occurred. Conclusion: In contrast to centralized admission via a ward exclusively dedicated to children with unclear SARS-CoV-2 status and discontinuation of elective treatments, maintenance of elective care and decentralized admission allowed the almost normal use of hospital resources, yet without increased risk of nosocomial infections with SARS-CoV-2. By this approach unwanted sequelae of withheld specialized pediatric non-emergency treatment to child and adolescent health may be avoided.","Terliesner, Nicolas; Rosen, Alexander; Kaindl, Angela M.; Reuter, Uwe; Lippold, Kai; Mall, Marcus A.; von Bernuth, Horst; Gratopp, Alexander",Front Pediatr,315,32

The France's independent COVID-19 Control and Society Connection Council (CCL) has been established by law in May 2020 to issue advice and recommendations on the national epidemic digital systems. OBJECTIVE We are presenting here the CCL's recommendations, the objective being to increase French DCT's uptake and utility. METHODS As the country's most vulnerable population has been subjected to greater virus exposure, stronger lockdown impact and less access to prevention and health care services, the CCL is particularly aware of health inequalities. RESULTS French apps ""TousAntiCovid"" had been downloaded by 13.6 million (20%) of the French population in March, 2021. To promote the use of the apps, the CCL had recommended to introduce increased communication about the app's individual and collective objectives. The CCL has also recommended the introduction of clear, simple, accessible, incentivising, non-coercive information inside the tool. In addition, the CCL recommended improving public health policies to address the needs of underprivileged. CONCLUSIONS The CCL calls for developing population empowerment with digital tools, public health culture for decision-makers dealing with health determinants, taking social considerations into account, and incorporating community participation.","Albouy-Llaty, Marion; Martin, Caroline; Benamousig, Daniel; Bothorel, Eric; Munier, Gilles; Simonin, Catherine; Guéant, Jean-Louis; Rusch, Emmanuel",Journal of medical Internet research,315,22

We investigated relationships between CVD, cardiac biomarkers and outcome in COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed nâ=â252 patients from a multicenter study and provided comparison according to the presence or absence of underlying CVD. Cardiac biomarkers high-sensitivity Troponin [upper reference of normality (URN) 35âpg/ml for Troponin I and 14âpg/ml for Troponin T] and natriuretic peptides (Nt-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, URN 300âpg/ml and B-type natriuretic peptide, URN 100âpg/ml) were both available in nâ=â136. RESULTS: Mean age was 69â±â16âyears (56% men, 31% with previous CVD). Raised hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides were detected in 36 and 50% of the cases respectively. Age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hemoglobin, hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides were independently associated with underlying CVD (Pâ<â0.05 for all). Compared with the normal biomarkers subgroups, patients with isolated hs-Troponin elevation had higher in-hospital mortality (31 vs. 4%, Pâ<â0.05), similar CVD prevalence (15 vs. 11%) and trend towards higher D-dimer (930 vs. 397âng/ml, Pâ=â0.140). Patients with both biomarkers elevated had higher age, D-dimer, CVD and in-hospital mortality prevalence compared with other subgroups (all Pâ<â0.05 for trend). Outcome analysis revealed previous CVD [model 1: OR 2.72 (95% CI 1.14-6.49), Pâ=â0.024. model 2: OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.05-6.71), Pâ=â0.039], hs-Troponin (log10) [OR 2.61 (95% CI 1.21-5.66), Pâ=â0.015] and natriuretic peptides (log10) [OR 5.84 (95%CI 2.43-14), Pâ<â0.001] to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In our population, previous CVD was part of a vulnerable phenotype including older age, comorbidities, increased cardiac biomarkers and worse prognosis. Patients with isolated increase in hs-Troponin suffered higher mortality rates despite low prevalence of CVD, possibly explained by higher COVID-19-related systemic involvement.","Arcari, Luca; Luciani, Michelangelo; Cacciotti, Luca; Pucci, Mariateresa; Musumeci, Maria Beatrice; Pietropaolo, Lorenzo; Spuntarelli, Valerio; Negro, Andrea; Camastra, Giovanni; Bentivegna, Enrico; Marazzi, Giuseppe; Sighieri, Cinzia; Ansalone, Gerardo; Santini, Claudio; Martelletti, Paolo; Volpe, Massimo; De Biase, Luciano",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),315,1

Owing to the differences in its genotype, FCoV belongs to a separate clade along with other viruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), which can be isolated from cats. In this study, a PCR assay was developed to differentiate these coronaviruses concurrently. Multiplex differential RT-PCR was performed with primers based on the highly conserved coronavirus membrane protein. Three primer sets were designed: a primer pair (S1 and S2) that can bind to conserved sequences in all target coronaviruses, a CCoV-specific primer (S3), and a TGEV-specific primer (S4). Because of the high sequence homology among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, a nucleotide preceding the last pair of dissimilar nucleotides in S3 and S4 was substituted with an inosine to allow primer binding. This assay could detect and differentiate FCoV (n = 7), CCoV (n = 4), and TGEV (n = 8) precisely and did not show any cross-reactivity with other pathogens. These results suggest that this molecular approach provides a rapid and reliable way to detect FCoV, especially in feline clinical specimens.","Han, Jae-Ik; Kang, Shien-Young; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Na, Ki-Jeong",J Virol Methods,315,30

Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.","Wolters, Femke; de Bovenkamp, Jeroen van; den Bosch, Bart van; den Brink, Sharon van; Broeders, Maaike; Chung, Ngoc Hoa; Favié, Barbara; Goderski, Gabriel; Kuijpers, Judith; Overdevest, Ilse; Rahamat-Langedoen, Janette; Wijsman, Lisa; Melchers, Willem JG; Meijer, Adam",J Clin Virol,315,29

Following the first reported case of GBS after Zika virus infection in 2013, there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of GBS in endemic countries, such as French Polynesia and Latin American countries. The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), and GBS is another emerging research hotspot. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that GBS patients associated with Zika virus infection or COVID‐19 tend to manifest acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rather than acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Causative autoantibodies, such as anti‐ganglioside antibodies in AMAN associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, have not been identified in GBS associated with these emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested molecular mimicry between these viruses and human proteins related to GBS. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of new vaccines, containing artificial messenger RNA encoding the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2, against. These vaccines are now available in many countries and massive vaccination campaigns are currently ongoing. Although there are long‐standing concerns about the increased risk of GBS after inoculation of conventional vaccines, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit administration of currently available vaccines, because the benefits outweigh the risks.","Koike, Haruki; Katsuno, Masahisa",Clin Exp Neuroimmunol,315,20

The unprecedent worldwide confinement, in which Spain has been one of the most affected—with severe rules governing confinement—may have changed physical activity (PA) and sedentary habits due to prolonged stays at home. Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate how self-reported PA and sedentary time (ST) have changed during confinement in the Spanish population. Methods: 3800 healthy adults (age 18–64 years) residing in Spain answered the international physical activity questionnaire short (IPAQ-S) twice between 23 March and 1 April (confinement). Data analysis was carried out taking into consideration meeting general PA recommendations before confinement, age and gender. Results: Self-reported PA decreased significantly during confinement in our sample. Vigorous physical activities (VPA) and walking time decreased by 16.8% (p < 0.001) and 58.2% (p < 0.001), respectively, whereas ST increased by 23.8% (p < 0.001).

The virus is classified in genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been widely circulating for decades in South America. GI-11 is an exclusive South American lineage while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Here, we obtained the whole genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains here sequenced are the first obtained in South America for the infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spreading and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and possess the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic incongruence analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Euro Asiatic strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that have retained the full-length S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant virus have been extraordinary successful, persisting in the continent for several years with a notorious wide geographic distribution. Our findings reveal a singular viral dynamics and emphasize the importance of complete genomic characterization to understand the emergence and evolutionary history of viral variants.","Marandino, Ana; Tomás, Gonzalo; Panzera, Yanina; Greif, Gonzalo; Parodi-Talice, Adriana; Hernández, Martín; Techera, Claudia; Hernández, Diego; Pérez, Ruben",Infect Genet Evol,315,16

We previously cloned and characterized a novel jacalin-like lectin gene (Ta-JA1) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which codes a modular JRP with disease response and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains and is present only in the Gramineae family. The function of this protein is still unclear. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 and related proteins from cereals grouped together, which diverged from JRL with an additional N-terminal disease response domain. The recombinant Ta-JA1 proteins agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and this hemagglutination activity was preferentially inhibited by mannose. The Ta-JA1 protein was able to inhibit E. coli cell growth. Overexpression of Ta-JA1 in transgenic tobacco plants increased their resistance to infection by tobacco bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Our results suggest that Ta-JA1 belongs to a mannose-specific lectin, which may confer a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to plant pathogens. Ta-JA1 and its homologues in maize, rice, sorghum and creeping bentgrass may represent a new type of monocot lectin with a modular structure and diversity of physiological functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses.","Ma, Qing-Hu; Tian, Bing; Li, Yun-Liang",Biochimie,315,18

Such evidence is culled from (1) the study of conditions necessary for hemagglutination; (2) the examination of specific factors affecting either the cell or the virion to enhance, alter, or abolish the reaction; and (3) the direct physicochemical analysis of cells, viruses, and “receptor analogs.” The hemadsorption phenomenon also provides evidence for virus-erythrocyte interactions, which is based on the attachment of erythrocytes to infected cells in culture having hemagglutinin at their surfaces. This phenomenon reflects the interaction between erythrocytes and viral envelope components. The major virus groups that react with erythrocytes include myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pseudomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, arboviruses, reoviruses, enteroviruses, and miscellaneous hemagglutinating viruse (rubella virus, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and oncogenic viruses). The agglutination of erythrocytes by the direct action of viral particles was first described in connection with myxoviruses. This led directly to the discovery of viral neuraminidase—a property unique to myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. A number of viruses unrelated to myxoviruses have since been shown to agglutinate erythrocytes of various species. The visible result of viral hemagglutination is the “pattern” formed at the bottom of a test tube or well plate by lattices of red cells lightly conjoined by viral hemagglutinin. Hemagglutination serves as a useful direct means of titering intact viral particles or hemagglutinating subunits.","Howe, C.; Lee, L. T.",Advances in Virus Research,315,1

Increasing PCPs’ job satisfaction is proposed as a solution in this regard. Positive Health (PH) is an upcoming, comprehensive health concept. Among others, this concept promises to promote PCPs’ job satisfaction. However, there is limited research into PH’s effects on this topic. This study, therefore, aims to provide insight into how adopting PH in a general practice affects PCPs’ job satisfaction. METHODS: An ethnographic case study was conducted in a Dutch general practice that is currently implementing PH. Data collected included 11 semi-structured interviews and archival sources. All data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified three themes regarding PCPs’ adoption of PH and job satisfaction, namely [1] adopting and adapting Positive Health, [2] giving substance to Positive Health in practice, and [3] changing financial and organizational structures. Firstly, the adoption of PH was the result of a match between the practice and the malleable and multi-interpretable concept. Secondly, PH supported PCPs to express, legitimize, and promote their distinctive approach to care work and its value. This strengthened them to further their holistic approach to health and stimulate autonomy in practice, with respect to both patients and professionals. Thirdly, the concept enabled PCPs to change their financial and organizational structures, notably freeing time to spend on patients and on their own well-being. This allowed them to enact their values. The changes made by the practice increased the job satisfaction of the PCPs. CONCLUSIONS: PH contributed to the job satisfaction of the PCPs of the general practice by functioning as an adaptable frame for change. This frame helped them to legitimize and give substance to their vision, thereby increasing job satisfaction. PH’s malleability allows for the frame’s customization and the creation of the match. Simultaneously, malleability introduces ambiguity on what the concept entails. In that regard, PH is not a readily implementable intervention. We recommend that other organizations seeking to adopt PH consider whether they are willing and able to make the match and explore how PH can help substantiate their vision.

There is a lack of interventional data investigating whether providing nutritional support during the hospital stay in patients at risk for malnutrition presenting with lower respiratory tract infection lowers mortality. METHODS: For this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (EFFORT), we analyzed data of a subgroup of patients with confirmed lower respiratory tract infection from an initial cohort of 2028 patients. Patients at nutritional risk (Nutritional Risk Screening [NRS] score ≥3 points) were randomized to receive protocol-guided individualized nutritional support to reach protein and energy goals (intervention group) or standard hospital food (control group). The primary endpoint of this analysis was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 378 of 2028 EFFORT patients (mean age 74.4 years, 24% with COPD) into this analysis. Compared to usual care hospital nutrition, individualized nutritional support to reach caloric and protein goals showed a similar beneficial effect of on the risk of mortality in the subgroup of respiratory tract infection patients as compared to the main EFFORT trial (odds ratio 0.47 [95%CI 0.17 to 1.27, p = 0.136] vs 0.65 [95%CI 0.47 to 0.91, p = 0.011]) with no evidence of a subgroup effect (p for interaction 0.859). Effects were also similar among different subgroups based on etiology and type of respiratory tract infection and for other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: This subgroup analysis from a large nutrition support trial suggests that patients at nutritional risk as assessed by NRS 2002 presenting with bronchopulmonary infection to the hospital likely have a mortality benefit from individualized inhospital nutritional support. The small sample size and limited statistical power calls for larger nutritional studies focusing on this highly vulnerable patient population.

We have identified three therapeutic antibodies, Tremelimumab, Ipilimumab and Afasevikumab. Interestingly, these antibodies target CTLA4 and IL17A, levels of which have been shown to be elevated during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The candidate antibodies were evaluated further for epitope restriction, interaction energy and interaction surface to gauge their repurposability to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work provides candidate antibody scaffolds with dual activities of plausible viral neutralization and immunosuppression. Further, these candidate antibodies can also be explored in diagnostic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Through a retrospective cohort study, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Dongxihu Fangcang shelter hospitals were analyzed, and the factors that affected the disease progression of COVID-19 patients were explored. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of 714 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed at Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital between February 7 and March 8, 2020. We described the clinical characteristics and distribution of discharge or transfer times for each patient. According to the disease progression of COVID-19 patients, we divided all patients into Non-Deteriorated group and Deteriorated group. Furthermore, binary logistic regression was used for a single outcome and multiple response variables. RESULTS: We treated 789 patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, of which 714 were included in this study, which included 326 (45.66%) deteriorated patients and 388 (54.34%) non-deteriorated patients. The mean age of the study population was 48.16±12.44 years. Of all patients, 319 (44.7%) were men and 395 (55.3%) were women. The average length of the patient’s stay was 16.08±5.13 days. The most common clinical feature on admission was fever (593 of 714, 83.05%). It is worth noting that 80 (11.20%) of the 714 patients were asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, diabetes, respiratory system disease, fever, dyspnea, and nasal congestion were risk factors associated with deterioration in cases with COVID-19 patients, and asymptomatic (OR: 0.058; 95% CI: 0.022–0.155; P<0.001) was the protective factor for deterioration of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Accompanied by chronic diseases, old age, fever, nasal congestion, and dyspnea were factors that influenced the aggravation of COVID-19 patients, and more attention and treatment should be given to these patients.","Liu, Jia; Zhang, Jun-Fei; Ma, Han-Ning; Feng, Ke; Chen, Zhong-Wei; Yang, Li-Shan; Mei, Bin; Zhang, Jun-Jian",Ther Clin Risk Manag,315,1

Whereas cellular immunity controls acute infection, humoral immunity regulates central nervous system (CNS) persistence. Maintenance of serum Ab was correlated with tissue distribution of virus‐specific Ab‐secreting cells (ASC). Although virus‐specific ASC declined in cervical lymph node and spleen after infectious virus clearance, virus‐specific serum Ab was sustained at steady levels, with a delay in neutralizing Ab. Virus‐specific ASC within the CNS peaked rapidly 1 wk after control of infectious virus and were retained throughout chronic infection, consistent with intrathecal Ab synthesis. Surprisingly, frequencies of ASC in the BM remained low and only increased gradually. Nevertheless, virus‐specific ASC induced by peripheral infection localized to both spleen and BM. The data suggest that CNS infection provides strong stimuli to recruit ASC into the inflamed tissue through sustained up‐regulation of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10. Irrespective of Ag deprivation, CNS retention of ASC coincided with elevated BAFF expression and ongoing differentiation of class II(+ )to class II(–)CD138(+)CD19(+ )plasmablasts. These results confirm the CNS as a major ASC‐supporting environment, even after resolution of viral infection and in the absence of chronic ongoing inflammation.","Tschen, Shuen‐Ing; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Hinton, David R.; Atkinson, Roscoe D.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.",Eur J Immunol,315,30

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the combination of antivirals (LPV/r and HCQ) or their single use in COVID-19 hospitalized patients vs. standard of care (SoC). Methods: Patients ≥18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as positive RT-PCR from nasal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab or positive serology, admitted at L.

Results: A total of 590 patients were included in the analysis: 36.3% female, 64 years (IQR 51–76), and 91% with pneumonia. Cumulative probability of invasive ventilation/death at 14 days was 21.2% (95% CI 17.6, 24.7), without difference between SOC, LPV/r, hydroxychloroquine, HCQ + LPV/r, and SoC. The risk of invasive ventilation/death in the groups appeared to vary by baseline ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). Overall cumulative probability of confirmed negative nasopharyngeal swabs at 14 days was 44.4% (95% CI 38.9, 49.9), without difference between groups. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, we found no difference in the rate of invasive ventilation/death or viral shedding by different strategies, as in randomized trials performed to date.

Due to the cessation of all non-emergent surgical cases in the USA and worldwide, the professional lives and practices of many physicians have been negatively affected. However, among different physicians and specifically plastic surgeons, cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of their cases are semi-elective and elective. The ability to perform semi-elective and elective cases is dependent on state and local authorities’ regulations, and it is currently uncertain when the ban, if ever, will be completely lifted. Financial constraints on patients and their future inability to pay for these procedures due to the COVID-19-related economic recession are things to consider. Overall, the goal of this unprecedented time for cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons is for their medical practices to survive, to conserve cash flow although income is low to none, and to maintain their personal finances. In this paper, the authors review the financial impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the practices of cosmetic plastic surgeons in the USA and worldwide, along with some potential approaches to maintain their practices and financial livelihoods.

In this study, we established persistent infection of SARS-CoV in the Vero E6 cell line. Acute infection of Vero E6 with SARS-CoV produced a lytic infection with characteristic rounding cytopathic effects (CPE) and the production of a large number of infectious particles in the culture fluid within 3 days post-infection. Upon subsequent culturing of the remaining adherent cells, the cells gradually proliferated and recovered normal morphology similar to that of the parental cells, and continued to produce large numbers of infectious viral particles during the observation period of 5 months. Among a total of 87 cell clones obtained from the persistently infected Vero E6, only four cell clones (named #13, #18, #21, and #34) were positive for viral RNA. Clones #13, #18, and #34 shifted to viral RNA-negative during subsequent cultures, while #21 continuously produced infectious particles at a high rate. The SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was almost completely down regulated from the cell surface of persistently infected cells. Western blot analysis as well as electron microscopy indicated that the ratios of spike to nucleocapsid protein in clone #21 as well as its parental persistently infected cells were lower than that in the cells in the acute phase of infection. These Vero E6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV may be useful for clarifying the mechanism of the persistent infection and also for elucidating the possible pathophysiologic significance of such long-term maintenance of this virus.","Yamate, Masanobu; Yamashita, Makiko; Goto, Toshiyuki; Tsuji, Shoutaro; Li, Yong-Gang; Warachit, Jiranan; Yunoki, Mikihiro; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi",Microbes Infect,315,14

Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n-3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish oil feeding for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C57BL/6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil:1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish oil feeding also resulted in a 40% higher mortality rate, a 70% higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD8(+) T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil feeding can alter the immune response to influenza infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.","Schwerbrock, Nicole M.

We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac operations and interventions undertaken in England. METHODS AND RESULTS : An administrative database covering hospital activity for England, the Health Episodes Statistics, was used to assess a total of 286 697 hospitalizations for cardiac operations and interventions, as well as 227 257 hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and 453 799 for heart failure (HF) from 7 January 2019 to 26 July 2020. Over the 3 months of ‘lockdown’, total numbers and mean reductions in weekly rates [n (−%)], compared with the same time period in 2019, were: coronary artery bypass grafting [−2507 (−64%)]; percutaneous coronary intervention [−5245 (−28%)]; surgical [−1324 (−41%)] and transcatheter [−284 (−21%)] aortic valve replacement; mitral valve replacement; implantation of pacemakers [−6450 (−44%)], cardiac resynchronization therapy with [−356 (−42%)] or without [−491 (−46%)] defibrillation devices, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [−501 (−45%)]; atrial fibrillation ablation [−1902 (−83%)], and other ablations [−1712 (−64%)] (all P < 0.001). Over this period, there were 21 038 fewer procedures than in the reference period in 2019 (P < 0.001). These changes paralleled reductions in hospitalizations for MI [−10 794 (−27%)] and HF [−63 058 (−28%)] (both P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS : The COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial reductions in the number of cardiac operations and interventions undertaken. An alternative strategy for healthcare delivery to patients with cardiac conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently needed.","Leyva, Francisco; Zegard, Abbasin; Okafor, Osita; Stegemann, Berthold; Ludman, Peter; Qiu, Tian",Europace,315,2

The object of this study is to use WGS for the epidemiological and molecular characterization of M. tuberculosis clinical strains from Chinchiná, Caldas, a small town in Colombia with a high incidence of TB. Sputum samples were obtained during the first semester of 2020 from six patients and cultured in solid Löwenstein-Jensen medium.

The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impact older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes, and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis. Methods: A total of 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, medical and psychiatric history. as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Mental health status was assessed using the 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Results: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single, and retired. In total, 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. Conclusion: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline is a useful initiative to support the psychosocial needs of older adults during a health crisis.","Wahl, Anna-Sophia; Benson, Gloria; Hausner, Lucrezia; Schmitt, Sandra; Knoll, Annika; Ferretti-Bondy, Adriana; Hefter, Dimitri; Froelich, Lutz",Geriatrics (Basel),315,24

As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 °C vs. 37 °C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.","Pagani, Isabel; Ghezzi, Silvia; Clementi, Massimo; Poli, Guido; Bussi, Mario; Pianta, Luca; Trimarchi, Matteo; Vicenzi, Elisa",bioRxiv,315,5

When mobility data are limited, spatial interaction models have been widely used to estimate human travel, but have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income settings. Geographic, sociodemographic, and infrastructure differences may impact the ability for models to capture these patterns, particularly in rural settings. Here, we analyzed mobility patterns inferred from mobile phone data in four Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the ability for variants on gravity and radiation models to estimate travel. Adjusting the gravity model such that parameters were fit to different trip types, including travel between more or less populated areas and/or different regions, improved model fit in all four countries. This suggests that alternative models may be more useful in these settings and better able to capture the range of mobility patterns observed.","Meredith, Hannah R; Giles, John R; Perez-Saez, Javier; Mande, Théophile; Rinaldo, Andrea; Mutembo, Simon; Kabalo, Elliot N; Makungo, Kabondo; Buckee, Caroline O; Tatem, Andrew J; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Wesolowski, Amy",eLife (Cambridge),315,24

The subunit vaccines are the safest and most widely used vaccine platform and highly effective against a multitude of infectious diseases. An adjuvant is essential for subunit vaccines to enhance the magnitude and durability of immune responses. In this study, we determined whether a combination of toll-like receptor (TLR)1/2 and TLR3 agonists (L-pampo) can be a potent adjuvant for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine. We measured a neutralizing antibody (nAb) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-blocking antibody against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We also detected interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by using ELISPOT and ELISA assays. By employing a ferret model, we detected nAbs and IFN-γ producing cells and measured viral load in nasal wash after the challenge of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo stimulated robust humoral and cellular immune responses. The efficacy of L-pampo was higher than the other adjuvants. Furthermore, in the ferret model, SARS-CoV-2 antigens with L-pampo elicited nAb response and antigen-specific cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2, resulting in substantially decreased viral load in their nasal wash. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 antigens formulated with TLR agonists, L-pampo, can be a potent subunit vaccine to promote sufficient protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Jeong, Soo-Kyung; Heo, Yoon-Ki; Jeong, Jei-Hyun; Ham, Su-Jin; Yum, Jung-Sun; Ahn, Byung-Cheol; Song, Chang-Seon; Chun, Eun-Young",Vaccines (Basel),315,16

While many coronaviruses (CoVs) encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a. Additionally, proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell function. In the present work, a comparative study of the functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E and 3a proteins. Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these activities. A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional PBM restored virus viability. E protein IC activity and the presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice. In contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity. Therefore, dominance of the IC and PBM of protein E over those of protein 3a was demonstrated in the induction of pathogenesis in mice.","Castaño-Rodriguez, Carlos; Honrubia, Jose M.; Gutiérrez-Álvarez, Javier; DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Verdia-Báguena, Carmina; Queralt-Martín, Maria; Kochan, Grazyna; Perlman, Stanley; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis",mBio,315,26

The Spanish Government adopted physical distancing measures on March 14; 13 days after the epidemic outbreak started its exponential growth. Our objective in this paper was to evaluate ex-ante (before the flattening of the curve) the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the Spanish Government to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. Our hypothesis was that the behavior of the epidemic curve is very similar in all countries. We employed a time series design, using information from January 17 to April 5, 2020 on the new daily COVID-19 cases from Spain, China and Italy. We specified two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with variable response from the Gaussian family (i.e. linear mixed models): one to explain the shape of the epidemic curve of accumulated cases and the other to estimate the effect of the intervention. Just one day after implementing the measures, the variation rate of accumulated cases decreased daily, on average, by 3.059 percentage points, (95% credibility interval: −5.371, −0.879). This reduction will be greater as time passes. The reduction in the variation rate of the accumulated cases, on the last day for which we have data, has reached 5.11 percentage points. The measures taken by the Spanish Government on March 14, 2020 to mitigate the epidemic curve of COVID-19 managed to flatten the curve and although they have not (yet) managed to enter the decrease phase, they are on the way to do so.","Saez, Marc; Tobias, Aurelio; Varga, Diego; Barceló, Maria Antònia",Science of The Total Environment,315,0

Informal care (IC) costs, and their effects on outcomes, are not known. This study aimed to determine the IC costs for older adults in the last 3 months of life, and their relationships with outcomes, adjusting for care quality. METHODS: Mortality follow-back postal survey. Setting: Palliative care services in England (London), Ireland (Dublin) and the USA (New York, San Francisco). Participants: Informal carers (ICrs) of decedents who had received palliative care. Data: ICrs reported hours and activities, care quality, positive aspects and burdens of caregiving, and completed the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG). Analysis: All costs (formal, informal) were calculated by multiplying reported hours of activities by country-specific costs for that activity. IC costs used country-specific shadow prices, e.g. average hourly wages and unit costs for nursing care. Multivariable logistic regression analysis explored the association of potential explanatory variables, including IC costs and care quality, on three outcomes: positive aspects and burdens of caregiving, and subsequent grief. RESULTS: We received 767 completed surveys, 245 from London, 282 Dublin, 131 New York and 109 San Francisco. Most respondents were women (70%); average age was 60 years. On average, patients received 66–76 h per week from ICrs for ‘being on call’, 52–55 h for ICrs being with them, 19–21 h for personal care, 17–21 h for household tasks, 15–18 h for medical procedures and 7–10 h for appointments. Mean (SD) IC costs were as follows: USA $32,468 (28,578), England $36,170 (31,104) and Ireland $43,760 (36,930). IC costs accounted for 58% of total (formal plus informal) costs. Higher IC costs were associated with less grief and more positive perspectives of caregiving. Poor home care was associated with greater caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS: Costs to informal carers are larger than those to formal care services for people in the last three months of life. If well supported ICrs can play a role in providing care, and this can be done without detriment to them, providing that they are helped. Improving community palliative care and informal carer support should be a focus for future investment.","Higginson, Irene J.; Yi, Deokhee; Johnston, Bridget M.; Ryan, Karen; McQuillan, Regina; Selman, Lucy; Pantilat, Stephen Z.; Daveson, Barbara A.; Morrison, R.

Nous avons réalisé un bilan physique et psychologique à moyen terme chez des soignants ayant été infectés par la Covid-19 entre mars et avril 2020. Matériels et méthodes Un bilan à distance en hôpital de jour a été proposé systématiquement à tous les soignants ayant présenté une infection à Covid-19 au décours de la V1. Le bilan comportait un bilan somatique systématique et orienté en fonction des symptômes, des ateliers de groupe (chorale, façon ludique de travailler la respiration et jeu Trivial-Covid, façon ludique d’aborder différents domaines de connaissance de l’infection), des scores HAD, anxiété (A) et dépression (D), et un entretien psychologique. Résultats Parmi les 142 soignants concernés, 120 ont accepté le bilan(85%) réalisé entre fin avril et début juillet. Quatre soignants ont été exclus de l’analyse car infection à Covid-19 non prouvée biologiquement. Au total, 100 femmes et 16 hommes, d’âge moyen 43 ans [22–65] ont réalisé le bilan en moyenne 67jours après la PCR+, 54 IDE/cadre, 34 AS, 11 médecins, 8 ASH et 7 administratifs. La plupart (93) n’avait aucune comorbidité, 14 avaient une HTA, 6 un diabète et 7 un asthme. Seuls 8 (7%) étaient fumeurs, dont 5 moins de 5 cig/jour). Cinq avaient été hospitalisés. Presque tous avaient eu un arrêt de travail (111/116), en médiane 18jours. Des scores significatifs HAD-A>8 étaient retrouvés chez 33/111, et HAD-D>8 chez 17/111. À la question : « Par rapport à votre état antérieur, diriez-vous que vous avez complètement récupéré (ou symptômes mineurs qui n’affectent pas leur vie quotidienne) »? 77 (66 %) ont répondu oui. Cependant 64 signalaient une persistance de signes, majoritairement asthénie (25) et dyspnée d’effort (25). Le bilan a dépisté 3 anémies, 2 possibles HTA, un nodule pulmonaire, un nodule surrénalien et une cytolyse hépatique. Nous n’avons pas trouvé de relation significative entre une sévérité de l’infection (hospitalisation, AT>30jours, nombre de signes cliniques>10, scores HAD A et D>8) et les caractéristiques sociodémographiques des soignants (sexe, âge, fonction).

The enzymatic activity and crystal structure of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nsp15 are undefined, and the protein’s role in replication remains unclear. We verified the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity of IBV and found that the EndoU active sites were located in the C terminus of nsp15 and included His223, His238, Lys278, and Tyr334. We further constructed an infectious clone of the IBV-rSD strain (rSD-wild type [WT]) and EndoU-deficient IBVs by changing the codon for the EndoU catalytic residues to alanine. Both the rSD-WT and EndoU-deficient viruses propagated efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs. Conversely, EndoU-deficient viral propagation was severely impaired in chicken embryonic kidney cells, which was reflected in the lower viral mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis. After infecting chickens with the parental rSD-WT strain and EndoU-deficient viruses, the EndoU-deficient virus-infected chickens presented reduced mortality, tissue injury, and viral shedding. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses can emerge from animal reservoirs into naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans and domestic animals. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a γ-coronavirus, infects respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems, causing millions of dollars in lost revenue worldwide annually. Mutating the viral endoribonuclease resulted in an attenuated virus and prevented protein kinase R activation. Therefore, EndoU activity is a virulence factor in IBV infections, providing an approach for generating live attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.","Zhao, Jing; Sun, Lu; Zhao, Ye; Feng, Delan; Cheng, Jinlong; Zhang, Guozhong",J Virol,315,1

Method We compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during a pre-pandemic period (10th March-10th June, 2010-2019) versus the COVID-19 first-wave period (10th March-10th June 2020). Patients were followed up for three months to capture psychotropic medication prescribing, GP/practice nurse consultation and referral to mental health services. Results 48,739 episodes of self-harm were recorded during the pre-pandemic period and 4,238 during the first-wave COVID-19 period. Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the pre-pandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs. 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (3.4%) was around half of that in the pre-pandemic cohort (6.5%). Conclusion Despite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention. Accessible outpatient and community services for people who have self-harmed are required as the COVID-19 crisis recedes and the population faces new challenges to mental health.","Steeg, S.; Carr, M.

We studied 8 healthy subjects who performed pedaling MI to command an electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI with a motorized pedal to receive passive movements as feedback. The EEG data were analyzed under the following four conditions: resting, MI calibration, MI online, and receiving passive pedaling (on-line phase). Most subjects produced, over the foot area, significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns around Cz when performing MI and receiving passive pedaling. The sharpest decrease was found for the low beta band.

Therefore, we performed this prospective analysis of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in children with known household exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 and compared their IgG status with the other adults exposed to the index case in the same household. A total of 30 families with a documented COVID‐19 index case were included. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies. In particular, 16/27 (59,3%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28/53 (52,3%) of pediatric contacts (p > .05). Among the pediatric population, children ≥5 years of age had a similar probability of having SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies (21/39, 53.8%) compared to those less than 5 years old (7/14, 50%) (p > .05). Adult partners and children also had a similar probability of having SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies. Interestingly, 10/28 (35.7%) of children and 5/27 (18.5%) of adults with SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies were previously diagnosed as COVID‐19 cases.

We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1442 health professional students at Sichuan University, China. At baseline (October 2019), participants were assessed for childhood adversity, stressful life events, internet addiction, and family functioning. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations of the above exposures with subsequent psychological distress and ASR in response to the outbreak. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four (26.63%) participants demonstrated clinically significant psychological distress, while 160 (11.10%) met the criterion for a probable ASR. Individuals who scored high on both childhood adversity and stressful life event experiences during the past year were at increased risks of both distress (ORs 2.00–2.66) and probable ASR (ORs 2.23–3.10), respectively. Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.60–2.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.50–3.10). By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33–0.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33–0.69). All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students. Extended family and professional support should be considered for vulnerable individuals during these unprecedented times.","Li, Yuchen; Wang, Yue; Jiang, Jingwen; Valdimarsdóttir, Unnur A.; Fall, Katja; Fang, Fang; Song, Huan; Lu, Donghao; Zhang, Wei",Psychological medicine,315,20

PubMed, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and online publication databases were searched. Thirty-three acute inflammatory myelopathy cases (among them, seven cases had associated brain lesions) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were reported. Demyelinating change was seen in cervical and thoracic regions (27.3% each, separately). Simultaneous involvement of both regions, cervical and thoracic, was seen in 45.4% of the patients. Most acute inflammatory myelopathy disorders reported sensory motor and bowel bladder dysfunctions. On cerebrospinal fluid analysis, pleocytosis and increased protein were reported in 56.7% and 76.7% of the patients, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction was positive in five patients. On T2-weighted imaging, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and short-segment demyelinating lesions were reported in 76% and 21%, respectively. Among the patients with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, 61% reported “moderate to significant” improvement and 26% demonstrated “no improvement” in the motor function of lower limbs. Demyelinating changes in the entire spinal cord were observed in three patients. Most of the patients with acute inflammatory myelopathy (including brain lesions) were treated with methylprednisolone (81.8%) and plasma-exchange therapy (42.4%).

This involved an innovative co-creation initiative through jointly designing and testing the feasibility of a toolkit of information, skill, and confidence-building, and coping mechanisms that can effectively shield them and their peers against the risks of mental stress during pregnancy and early motherhood. METHODS: Qualitative interviews and discussions from visual methodologies including Photovoice, digital storytelling, and public service announcements were conducted with 30 pregnant and adolescent mothers aged 14-19 years in four informal settlements either pregnant or having a child less than 2 years. The aims included; to generate an inventory of mental stressors during pregnancy and early motherhood; understand how mental stress affects the ability to seek care for themselves and their child, and understand individual coping strategies. RESULTS: The psychosocial challenges identified in order of importance included: chased from home by the parents; economic hardship; neglect and abandonment by the person responsible for the pregnancy; stigmatization by family, friends, and the community; feelings of shattered dreams; and daily stress related to living in poor and unhygienic conditions. During the pregnancy and early motherhood, the participants experienced feelings of embarrassment, shame, hopelessness, and to the extreme, suicidal thoughts clouded their minds. Main coping strategies included social isolation for some, socializing with other pregnant and adolescent mothers, and negative behaviors like the uptake of illicit drugs and alcohol and risky sexual relationships. CONCLUSION: The unpreparedness for early motherhood infused with inadequate psychosocial support led to increased mental stress and risk of depression. The interconnection between the triggers to mental stress showed the need to focus on a multifaceted approach to address the wellbeing of pregnant and adolescent mothers.","Wainaina, Caroline W; Sidze, Estelle Monique; Maina, Beatrice W; Badillo-Amberg, Icoquih; Anyango, Hazel Odhiambo; Kathoka, Faith; Khasowa, Dorcas; Okoror, Collins E M",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,315,1

In the present study, the antioxidant activities of hot-water extracts from natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis were investigated and evaluated using six in vitro assays, including inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation; scavenging abilities on DPPH•, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals; the reducing power and the chelating ability on ferrous ions. Among these assays, the extracts showed the best effect on the inhibition of linoleic peroxidation with the lowest IC50 values and with an inhibition rate over 90% at concentration of 0.8–1.6 mg/ml, more stable than that of α-tocopherol, a recognised natural antioxidant. The scavenging activities on superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals of the two extracts were slightly lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. DPPH• scavenging activities of both extracts reached over 80% inhibition at 4–8 mg/ml. Both extracts showed moderate reducing power and ferrous ion chelating activity. The IC50 value of the extract from cultured mycelia in all the tests, except for linoleic acid peroxidation, was significantly lower than that of natural mycelia. There was no evident correlation between the antioxidant activity and the content of protein, polysaccharides and mannitol of extracts from C. sinensis; the antioxidant activity may be due to a combined effect of these or some other compounds. These results suggested that both the extracts from cultured and natural mycelia have direct and potent antioxidant activities and that the cultured mycelia of the fungus could be used for the antioxidant activity to reduce the human demands on the natural resources of the fungus, an endangered species.","Dong, C.-H.; Yao, Y.-J.",Lebenson Wiss Technol,315,32

HKG stability was determined using GeNorm and NormFinder. Results from three different experimental conditions revealed high stability of TBP compared with the other HKGs profiled across the samples assayed. RPS9 showed stable expression among aphids on susceptible and resistant plants, whereas EF1a showed stable expression in tissues and developmental stages. Therefore, we recommend the TBP as a suitable HKG for efficient normalization among treatments, tissues, and developmental stages of A. glycines. In addition, RPS9 may be used for host-plant resistance experiments and EF1a could be considered for testing differential expression across tissues or developmental stages.

Given this, the reflexive team is an important organizational tool for protecting workers' well-being. The non-profit organization Maestri di Strada (MdS) (“Street Teachers”) conducts action research (AR) in the area of socio-education. The main tool used by the group to protect the well-being of its members is a guided reflexivity group, inspired by the Balint Group and termed the Multi-Vision Group (MG). In March 2020, because of the COVID-19 lockdown, the MdS team had to quickly revamp its working model, and MGs were held online for the first time. Aim: Through qualitative research that takes a longitudinal approach, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MG in supporting the team's reflexivity in this new online format. Methods: This article considers MGs during two different time periods: pre-pandemic (T1) and early pandemic (T2). During T1, the MdS team met 18 times in person, while during T2 the team met 12 times through an online platform (always under the guidance of a psychotherapist). During all sessions in both time periods, a silent observer was present in the meetings, and they subsequently compiled narrative reports. The textual corpora of the reports were submitted for a Thematic Analysis of Elementary Contexts through T-Lab Plus, in order to examine the main content of the groups' discourse. Results: The results (five clusters in T1; and five in T2) show that, during T2, the group devoted considerable time to experiences tied to the pandemic (T21: schools facing the pandemic crisis; T2.2: the pandemic: death, inner worlds, and thought resistance; T2.3: kids' stories involving physical distancing and emotional proximity). The group also came up with innovative educational initiatives that defied the lockdown (T2.4: fieldwork: the delivery of “packages of food for thought”; T2.5: the MdS group: identity and separation). Based on these findings, the MG most likely contributed to the emergence of MdS as a “resilient community,” capable of absorbing the shock of the pandemic and realizing a fast recovery response.","Parrello, Santa; Fenizia, Elisabetta; Gentile, Rosa; Iorio, Ilaria; Sartini, Clara; Sommantico, Massimiliano",Front Psychol,315,16

In France, General Practitioners (GPs) were not involved in the care organization’s decision-making process before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This omission could have generated stress for GPs. We aimed first to estimate the self-perception of stress as defined by the 10-item Perceived Stress Score (PSS-10), at the beginning of the pandemic in France, among GPs from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, a french administrative area severely impacted by COVID-19. Second, we aimed to identify factors associated with a self-perceived stress (PSS-10 ≥ 27) among socio-demographic characteristics of GPs, their access to reliable information and to personal protective equipment during the pandemic, and their exposure to well established psychosocial risk at work. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey between 8th April and 10th May 2020. The self-perception of stress was evaluated using the PSS-10, so to see the proportion of “not stressed” (≤20), “borderline” (21 ≤ PSS-10 ≤ 26), and “stressed” (≥27) GPs. The agreement to 31 positive assertions related to possible sources of stress identified by the scientific study committee was measured using a 10-point numeric scale. In complete cases, factors associated with stress (PSS-10 ≥ 27) were investigated using logistic regression, adjusted on gender, age and practice location. A supplementary analysis of the verbatims was made. RESULTS: Overall, 898 individual answers were collected, of which 879 were complete. A total of 437 GPs (49%) were stressed (PSS-10 ≥ 27), and 283 GPs (32%) had a very high level of stress (PSS-10 ≥ 30). Self-perceived stress was associated with multiple components, and involved classic psychosocial risk factors such as emotional requirements. However, in this context of health crisis, the primary source of stress was the diversity and quantity of information from diverse sources (614 GPs (69%, OR = 2.21, 95%CI [1.40–3.50], p < 0.001). Analysis of verbatims revealed that GPs felt isolated in a hospital-based model. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the pandemic was a source of stress for GPs.

Risks of hospitalization (aHR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.26) and mechanical ventilation (aHR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen in analyses according to type of indication (e.g., rheumatic or neurologic disease) and duration of CD20 inhibitor use (<1 or ≥1 year), and after excluding patients with interstitial lung disease, cancer, and those on glucocorticoids prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases prior to COVID-19 had higher mortality following COVID-19 than matched comparators, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate excess risks in CD20 inhibitor users during the ongoing pandemic.","Patel, Naomi J.; D’Silva, Kristin M.; Hsu, Tiffany Y-T.; DiIorio, Michael; Fu, Xiaoqing; Cook, Claire; Prisco, Lauren; Martin, Lily; Vanni, Kathleen M.M.; Zaccardelli, Alessandra; Zhang, Yuqing; Sparks, Jeffrey A.; Wallace, Zachary S.",medRxiv,315,29

However, its underlying mechanism in the current and onward transmission pattern remains unclear owing to the limited data and difficulties in separating the impacts of social distancing. Understanding the role of seasonality in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is imperative in formulating public health interventions. Here, the seasonal signals of the COVID-19 time series are extracted using the EEMD method, and a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model incorporated with seasonal factors is introduced to quantify its impact on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Seasonal signals decomposed via the EEMD method indicate that infectivity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 are both higher in colder climates. The quantitative simulation shows that the cold season in the Southern Hemisphere countries caused a 59.71±8.72% increase of the total infections, while the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere countries contributed to a 46.38±29.10% reduction. COVID-19 seasonality is more pronounced at higher latitudes, where larger seasonal amplitudes of environmental indicators are observed. Seasonality alone is not sufficient to curb the virus transmission to an extent that intervention measures are no longer needed, but health care capacity should be scaled up in preparation for new surges in COVID-19 cases in the upcoming cold season. Our study highlights the necessity of considering seasonal factors when formulating intervention strategies.","Liu, Xiaoyue; Huang, Jianping; Li, Changyu; Zhao, Yingjie; Wang, Danfeng; Huang, Zhongwei; Yang, Kehu",Environ Res,315,30

The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain. All patients had anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF when assessing a large panel of autoantibodies against intracellular and surface antigens relevant for central nervous system diseases using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Antigens included proteins well-established in clinical routine, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also a variety of specific undetermined epitopes on brain sections. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.","Franke, C.; Ferse, C.; Kreye, J.; Reincke, M.; Sanchez-Sendin, E.; Rocco, A.; Steinbrenner, M.; Angermair, S.; Treskatsch, S.; Zickler, D.; Eckardt, K.-U.; Dersch, R.; Hosp, J.; Audebert, H.

The estimated risk of infection from touching a contaminated surface was low (less than 5 in 10,000), suggesting fomites play a minimal role in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. The weekly percentage of positive samples (out of n=33 unique surfaces per week) best predicted variation in city-level COVID-19 cases using a 7-day lead time.

The primers were designed to target a 176-nucleotide fragment within a highly conserved region of the San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSVs) capsid gene. The assay detected viral RNA from nine marine vesivirus serotypes described previously, including two serotypes (SMSV-8 and -12) not identified with presently available molecular assays, a highly related bovine vesivirus strain (Bos-1), a mink vesivirus strain (MCV), and two novel genotypes isolated recently from Steller sea lions (SSL V810 and V1415). The real-time assay did not amplify sequences from the corresponding genomic regions of feline calicivirus (also in the genus Vesivirus) and representative members of the genus Norovirus.

Methods: The clinical profile of 172 patients with HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%) and 173 non-HF control individuals was analyzed retrospectively. The association between NLR and HFpEF and the predictive performance of NLR for HFpEF were assessed by the binary logistic regression analysis and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Multivariate linear regression models further examined the associations between NLR and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and average septal-lateral E/e', respectively. The freshly isolated neutrophils from 30 HFpEF patients and 42 non-HF controls were subjected to transcriptomic profiling. The biomarkers related to neutrophil activation and inflammation were detected in serum samples. Results: The HFpEF patients in Southeast China were lean and had comorbidity burden and worse cardiac structure/function. Compared with non-HF control individuals, HFpEF patients had a rise in NLR. NLR displayed an independent association with HFpEF [adjusted odds ratio, 2.351; 95% CI, 1.464–3.776; p < 0.001] and it predicted HFpEF with the area under the ROC 0.796 (95% CI, 0.748–0.845, p < 0.001). The positive associations between NLR and hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, and mitral E/e' were found in HFpEF patients. Moreover, patients had significantly elevated serum levels of neutrophil elastase and inflammatory biomarkers, both of which correlated with the mitral E/e' ratio. Finally, multiple molecules that drive neutrophil degranulation and inflammation, such as S100A8/A9/A12 and PADI4, were transcriptionally up-regulated in neutrophils of HFpEF patients. Conclusions: The high NLR coupled with transcriptional activation of neutrophils correlates with systemic inflammation and functional impairment in HFpEF patients, which may suggest a causative role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of the disease.","Bai, Bo; Cheng, Min; Jiang, Lingyan; Xu, Jiabin; Chen, Haibo; Xu, Yun",Front Cardiovasc Med,315,24

The study took place in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation). Methods A total of 157 HCWs from three different clinics (56, 60 and 41 HCWs, respectively) who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic period (May to August 2020) constituted the cohort. All of the three chosen clinics had followed COVID-19 screening, triage and other recommendations for safe practice. In addition to using personal protective equipment and other common barrier methods to lower virus transmission, these clinics were equipped with different types of aspirating systems that included V6000 used in dry mode, V6000 used in semi-dry mode and VS900, respectively. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and SARS-CoV-2-IgM-EIA-BEST enzyme immunoassay kits (Vector-Best). Results An overall prevalence of seropositivity was observed to be 11.5% (19/157 HCWs) over a five-month follow-up. The prevalence of infection was not found to be associated with sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). Significantly higher infection rates (p <0.001) were observed among HCWs working in the clinic equipped with the VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters, while the lowest infection rate was found among HCWs working in the clinic using the V6000 aspirating system in dry mode. Conclusions HCWs working in the clinic equipped with an aspirating system which has HEPA filters and released the air into an external environment (V6000) exhibited significantly lower seroprevalence rates compared to HCWs in the clinic using an aspirating system without HEPA filters which released air within the dental operatory away from the operation site (VS900).","Gugnani, Neeraj; Gugnani, Shalini",Evid Based Dent,315,1

Stem cells are yielded from the peripheral blood via apheresis. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the most commonly used mobilization agent among patients and donors. G-CSF is administered subcutaneously for multiple days. However, patients with mobilization failure cannot receive autologous stem cell transplantation and, therefore, cannot be treated adequately. The incidence rate of mobilization failure among patients is about 6–23%. Plerixafor is a molecule that inhibits the binding of chemokine receptor-4 with stromal-cell-derived factor-1, thereby resulting in the release of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood. Currently, plerixafor is used in patients with mobilization failure with G-CSF and is administered subcutaneously. Several studies conducted on different clinical settings have shown that plerixafor is effective and well tolerated by patients. However, more studies should be conducted to explore the optimal approach for plerixafor in patients with mobilization failure. The incidence of mobilization failure among donors is lower. However, plerixafor is not approved among donors with mobilization failure. Moreover, several clinical studies in donors have shown a beneficial effect of plerixafor. In addition, the adverse events of plerixafor are mild and transient, which can overcome the adverse events due to G-CSF. This review assessed the current role and effects of plerixafor in stem cell mobilization for autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantations.","Bilgin, Yavuz M",J Blood Med,315,5

In this study, we describe and update the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IPS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 (n = 1829). IPS was defined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute consensus definition: multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging, absence of lower respiratory tract infection, and hypoxemia. We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT. We examined conditioning intensity (nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative with high-dose total body irradiation [TBI] versus myeloablative with low-dose TBI) as an IPS risk factor in a time-to-event analysis using Cox models, controlled for age at transplant, HLA matching, stem cell source, and pretransplant Lung function Score (a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV(1)) and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)). Among 1829 HCT recipients, 67 fulfilled IPS criteria within 120 days (3.7%). Individuals who developed IPS were more likely to be black/non-Hispanic versus other racial groups and have severe pulmonary impairment but were otherwise similar to participants without IPS. In adjusted models, myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI was associated with increased risk of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.2). Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.","Wenger, David S.; Triplette, Matthew; Crothers, Kristina; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Hill, Joshua A.; Milano, Filippo; Shahrir, Shahida; Schoch, Gary; Vande Vusse, Lisa K.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,315,26

Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome limitations of observational studies, e.g. unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. Objective: To elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Method: In November, 2020, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released on 20 Oct. 2020). Our study population consisted of almost 2 million participants with either a (neuro)psychiatric disorder or data on COVID-19 status. Outcomes and exposures were anxiety, anxiety-and-stress related disorders, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-bipolar disorder combined (BIP-SCZ), and Alzheimer dementia on the one hand; and self-reported, confirmed, hospitalized, and very severe COVID-19 on the other. Results: In single-variable MR analysis the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for BIP-SCZ (a combined anxiety of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls): the effect estimate was consistent with increased risk of COVID-19. Nominally significant univariable results were in line with slightly elevated risks of COVID-19 for genetic liabilities to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. No COVID-19 phenotype consistently increased risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR, bipolar disorder was the only phenotype showing a Bonferroni-corrected significant effect on a COVID-19 phenotype, namely severe COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. Conclusions: Genetic liability to bipolar disorder slightly increases COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The contribution of bipolar disorder to these COVID-19 phenotypes was smaller than the odds ratios estimated by observational studies. Strength of association and direction of effect for genetic liability to schizophrenia were similar, albeit less significant. We found no consistent evidence of reverse effects, i.e. of genetic liability to COVID-19 on psychiatric disorders.","Luykx, J.; Lin, B.",,315,1

The S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV carries out fusion between the virus and the host cells. However, the exact mechanism of the cell fusion process is not well understood. Current model suggests that a conformational transition, upon receptor recognition, of the two heptad core regions of S2 may expose the hydrophobic fusogenic peptide or fusion peptide for membrane insertion. Three regions of the S2 subunit have been proposed to be involved in cell–cell fusion. The N-terminal fusion peptide (FP, residues 770–788), an internal fusion peptide (IFP, residues 873–888) and the pre-transmembrane region (PTM, residues 1185–1202) demonstrated interactions with model lipid membranes and potentially involved in the fusion process. Here, we have determined atomic resolution structures of these three peptides in DPC detergent micelles by solution NMR. FP assumes α-helical conformation with significant distortion at the central Gly residues; enabling a close packing among sidechains of aromatic residues including W, Y and F. The 3-D structure of PMT is characterized by a helix–loop–helix with extensive aromatic interactions within the helices. IFP adopts a rather straight α-helical conformation defined by packing among sidechains of aromatic and aliphatic residues. Paramagnetic spin labeled NMR has demonstrated surface localization of PMT whereas FP and IFP inserted into the micelles.

The stagnant development and poor grain filling of IS limit yields and the formation of good quality rice. A large number of studies on this phenomenon have been carried out from the genome, transcriptome and proteome level, indicating that asynchronous filling of SS and IS filling is a complex, but orderly physiological and biochemical process involving changes of a large number of genes, protein expression and modification. However, the analysis of metabolomics differences between SS and IS is rarely reported currently. RESULTS: This study utilized untargeted metabolomics and identified 162 metabolites in rice spikelets. Among them, 17 differential metabolites associated with unsynchronized grain filling between SS and IS, 27 metabolites were related to the stagnant development of IS and 35 metabolites related to the lower maximum grain-filling rate of IS compared with the SS. We found that soluble sugars were an important metabolite during grain filling for SS and IS. Absolute quantification was used to further analyze the dynamic changes of 4 types of soluble sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and trehalose) between SS and IS. The results showed that sucrose and trehalose were closely associated with the dynamic characteristics of grain filling between SS and IS. The application of exogenous sugar showed that trehalose functioned as a key sugar signal during grain filling of IS. Trehalose regulated the expression of genes related to sucrose conversion and starch synthesis, thereby promoting the conversion of sucrose to starch. The difference in the spatiotemporal expression of TPS-2 and TPP-1 between SS and IS was an important reason that led to the asynchronous change in the trehalose content between SS and IS. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study are helpful for understanding the difference in grain filling between SS and IS at the metabolite level. In addition, the present results can also provide a theoretical basis for the next step of using metabolites to regulate the filling of IS.","Min, Xiumei; Xu, Hailong; Huang, Fenglian; Wei, Yidong; Lin, Wenxiong; Zhang, Zhixing",BMC Plant Biol,315,11

Those patients with D-Dimer ≥ 500 ng/ml during SARS-CoV-2 infection had a decrease of central vessel density (mean difference 2.2; 95%CI 0.4–3.9) and perfusion density (mean difference 4.9; 95%CI 0.9–8.9) after the acute phase of COVID-19. These variations of vessel density and perfusion density were not documented in patients with LDH ≥ 500 U/L, CRP ≥ 10 mg/L and hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients showed short-term retinal vasculature abnormalities which may be related to a prothrombotic state associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the retinal microvasculature shares many morphological and physiological properties with the vasculature of other vital organs, further research is needed to establish whether patients with increased D-Dimer levels require more careful assessment and follow-up after COVID-19.","Guemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Donate-López, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; López-Guajardo, Lorenzo; Martín, José Luis R.; González-Armengol, Juan Jorge; García-Feijoó, Julián",Med Clin (Engl Ed),315,16

METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for Covid-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea (mMRC) scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean mMRC dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with VO2peak (%) (rho = −0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a slightly reduced VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all patients, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the ICU had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate above 90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for Covid-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for Covid-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted.","Debeaumont, David; Boujibar, Fairuz; Ferrand-Devouge, Eglantine; Artaud-Macari, Elise; Tamion, Fabienne; Gravier, Francis-Edouard; Smondack, Antoine; Cuvelier, Antoine; Muir, Jean-François; Alexandre, Kevin; Bonnevie, Tristan",Phys Ther,315,27

We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found 7 major mAb competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective importance of otherwise-redundant recognition.

Due to limitations in testing coverage, the true extent of the spread may not be fully reflected in the reported cases. In this study, we obtain time-varying estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 infections reported in the different states. METHODS: Following a methodology developed in prior work, we use a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate the true fraction of cases reported in different states. We also develop a delay adjusted test positivity estimation method and study the relationship between the estimated test positivity rate for each state and the estimated fraction of cases reported. SETTING: We apply this method of analysis to all Indian states reporting at least 100 deaths as of 10 October 2020. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that delay-adjusted case fatality ratios observed in different states range from 0.47% to 3.55%. The estimated fraction of cases reported in different states ranges from 39% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 1.38%, from 18.6% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.66%, and from 2.8% to 19.7% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.1%. We also demonstrate a statistically significant negative relationship between the fraction of cases reported in each state and the testing positivity rate. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates provide a means to quantify and compare the trends of reporting and the true level of current infections in different states. This information may be used to guide policies for prioritising testing in different states, and also to analyse the time-varying effects of different quarantine measures adopted in different states.","Unnikrishnan, Jayakrishnan; Mangalathu, Sujith; Kutty, Raman V",BMJ Open,315,19

It is important to know predictors of poor outcomes to optimize the strategies of care. Methods: 93 patients with CKD and 93 age-sex matched patients without CKD were included in the study. Data on demographic, clinical features, hematological indices and outcomes were noted and compared between the groups. Neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII) (platelet counts × neutrophil counts / lymphocyte counts) and lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR) were calculated on admission and the association of these markers with disease mortality in CKD patients was identified. Results: CKD patients had higher risk of severe disease, and mortality compared to non-CKD patients (72% vs 50.5%, p=0.003, 36,6% vs 10.8%, p<0.001, respectively) and were more likely to have higher values of immuno-inflammatory indices (leucocyte count, neutrophil, NLR, SII and C-reactive protein etc.) and lower level of lymphocyte and LCR. Also, higher levels of NLR, SII, PLR and lower level of LCR were seen in CKD patients who died compared to those recovered. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, NLR, SII, PLR and LCR area under the curve for in-hospital mortality of CKD patients were 0.830, 0.811, 0.664 and 0.712, respectively. Among all parameters, NLR and SII gave us the best ability to distinguish patients with higher risk of death. Based on the cut-off value of 1180.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the SII for predicting in-hospital mortality were found to be 67.5% and 79.6%, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity of the NLR were 85.2% and 66.1%, respectively, at the cut-off value of 5.1. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that NLR (≥5.1), SII (≥1180.5) and LCR (≤9) were predictors for in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: We report for the first time that SII is able to distinguish COVID-19 infected CKD patients of worse survival and it is as powerful as NLR in this regard. As SII is easily quantified from blood sample data, it may assist for early identification and timely management of CKD patients with worse survival. Antecedentes y objetivo: Los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica (ERC) son susceptibles a la infección por SARS-CoV-2 y más propensos a desarrollar una enfermedad grave. Es importante conocer los predictores de los malos resultados para optimizar las estrategias de atención. Métodos: Se incluyeron en el estudio 93 pacientes con ERC y 93 pacientes sin ERC, emparejados por edad y sexo. Los datos sobre las características demográficas, clínicas, índices hematológicos y resultados, se anotaron y compararon entre los grupos. La proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos (NLR), la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos (PLR), el índice de inflamación inmunitaria sistémica (SII) (recuentos de plaquetas × recuentos de neutrófilos / recuentos de linfocitos) y la proporción de linfocitos a PCR (LCR) se calcularon en el momento de la admisión y se identificó la asociación de estos marcadores con la mortalidad por enfermedad en pacientes con ERC. Resultados: Los pacientes con ERC tuvieron un mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave y mortalidad en comparación con los pacientes sin ERC (72% vs 50,5%, p = 0,003, 36,6% vs 10,8%, p <0,001, respectivamente) y tuvieron más probabilidades de tener valores más altos de índices inmuno inflamatorios (recuento de leucocitos, neutrófilos, NLR, SII y proteína C reactiva, etc.) y niveles más bajos de linfocitos y LCR. Además, se observaron niveles más altos de NLR, SII, PLR y un nivel más bajo de LCR en pacientes con ERC que murieron en comparación con los recuperados. En un análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor, el área NLR, SII, PLR y LCR bajo la curva de mortalidad hospitalaria de pacientes con ERC fueron de 0,830, 0,811, 0,664 y 0,712, respectivamente. Entre todos los parámetros, NLR y SII se dió a conocer la mejor manera de distinguir a los pacientes con mayor riesgo de muerte. Con base en el valor de corte de 1180,5, se encontró que la sensibilidad y especificidad del SII, para predecir la mortalidad hospitalaria, fue del 67,5% y 79,6%, respectivamente. La sensibilidad y especificidad correspondientes del NLR fueron del 85,2% y 66,1%, respectivamente, en el valor de corte de 5,1. El análisis de regresión logística escalonada hacia adelante mostró que el NLR (≥5,1), SII (≥1180,5) y LCR (≤9) fueron predictores de mortalidad hospitalaria. Conclusión: Informamos, por primera vez, que el SII es capaz de distinguir pacientes con ERC infectados por COVID-19 de peor supervivencia y, en este sentido, es tan poderoso como el NLR. Como el SII se cuantifica fácilmente a partir de los datos de las muestras de sangre, puede ayudar a la identificación temprana y el manejo oportuno de los pacientes con ERC con peor supervivencia.","Ozdemir, Arzu; Kocak, Sibel Yucel; Karabela, Semsi Nur; Yılmaz, Mürvet",Nefrologia,315,21

This study investigated the IPV help-seeking messages disseminated by the Spanish-speaking media in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We engaged in an exploratory content analysis of videos from Univision’s main website, the most-watched Spanish-speaking media network in the U.S. We searched for videos related to IPV help-seeking posted from March 19–April 21, 2020—including the weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the U.S. mandated a shelter-in-place. After assessing inclusion criteria, 29 videos were analyzed. Data were analyzed using basic content analysis to determine frequencies and inductive interpretive content analysis to code for help-seeking messages. We identified eight manifest messages related to seeking help when experiencing IPV in times of a crisis: (1) contact a professional resource; (2) contact law enforcement; (3) contact family, friends, and members of your community; (4) create a safety plan; (5) don’t be afraid, be strong; (6) leave the situation; (7) protect yourself at home; and (8) services are available despite the pandemic. We found that the manifest messages alluded to three latent messages: (1) it is your responsibility to change your circumstances; (2) you are in danger and in need of protection; and (3) you are not alone. IPV and media professionals should ensure a structural understanding of IPV in their help-seeking messages and avoid perpetrating stigmatizing and reductionist messages.","Alvarez-Hernandez, Luis R.; Cardenas, Iris; Bloom, Allison",J Fam Violence,315,18

This trend has seen a rising need for the high-quality digitization of content from pages and whiteboards to sharable online material. However, capturing this information is not always easy nor are the results always satisfactory. Available scanning apps vary in their usability and do not always produce clean results, retaining surface imperfections from the page or whiteboard in their output images. CleanPage, a novel smartphone-based document and whiteboard scanning system, is presented. CleanPage requires one button-tap to capture, identify, crop, and clean an image of a page or whiteboard. Unlike equivalent systems, no user intervention is required during processing, and the result is a high-contrast, low-noise image with a clean homogenous background. Results are presented for a selection of scenarios showing the versatility of the design. CleanPage is compared with two market leader scanning apps using two testing approaches: real paper scans and ground-truth comparisons. These comparisons are achieved by a new testing methodology that allows scans to be compared to unscanned counterparts by using synthesized images. Real paper scans are tested using image quality measures. An evaluation of standard image quality assessments is included in this work, and a novel quality measure for scanned images is proposed and validated. The user experience for each scanning app is assessed, showing CleanPage to be fast and easier to use.","Courtney, Jane",J Imaging,315,26

We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive CDRs into framework regions of an identified human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19.

Previous literature identified advanced age, higher severity of illness, elevated inflammatory biomarkers, acute organ dysfunction, comorbidities, and presentation from long‐term care facility as risk factors for mortality in patients from Wuhan, China, and the United States. Additional studies conducted in NYC are warranted to confirm these findings. The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors for in‐hospital mortality in patients with confirmed COVID‐19 infections. This was a retrospective case‐control study at The Brooklyn Hospital Center, a 464‐bed community teaching hospital. Adult patients with a confirmed COVID‐19 infection and who received at least 24 h of COVID‐19 therapy were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for in‐hospital mortality. Two‐hundred and eighty four patients were included, of whom 95 (33.5%) were nonsurvivors and 189 (66.5%) patients were survivors. Multivariate analysis showed higher in‐hospital mortality with advanced age (odds ratio [OR] 6.476; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.827–22.953), presentation from long‐term care facility (OR 4.259; 95% CI 1.481–12.250), elevated total bilirubin (OR 4.947; 95% CI 1.048–23.350), vasopressor initiation (OR 36.262; 95% CI 5.319–247.216), and development of renal failure (OR 36.261; 95% CI 2.667–493.046).

Such studies often fail to consider the complex spatial nature of such inequalities in their analysis, leading to the potential for bias and an inability to reach conclusions about the most appropriate structural levels for policy intervention. Methods We use publicly available population data on COVID-19 related- and all-cause mortality between March and July 2020 in England and Wales to investigate the spatial scale of such inequalities. We propose a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider four spatial scales at which processes driving inequality may act and apportion inequality between these. Results Adjusting for population age structure, number of care homes and residing in the North we find highest regional inequality in March and June/July. We find finer-grained within-region increased steadily from March until July. The importance of spatial context increases over the study period. No analogous pattern is visible for non-COVID mortality. Higher relative deprivation is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality at all stages of the pandemic but does not explain structural inequalities. Conclusions Results support initial stochastic viral introduction in the South, with initially high inequality decreasing before the establishment of regional trends by June and July, prior to reported regionality of the 'second-wave'. We outline how this framework can help identify structural factors driving such processes, and offer suggestions for a long-term, locally-targeted model of pandemic relief in tandem with regional support to buffer the social context of the area.","Griffith, G.

We investigated the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of OH2 as single agent or in combination with HX008, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: In this multicenter, phase I/II trial, we enrolled patients with standard treatment-refractory advanced solid tumors who have injectable lesions. In phase I, patients received intratumoral injection of OH2 at escalating doses (10(6), 10(7) and 10(8)CCID50/mL) as single agent or with fixed-dose HX008. The recommended doses were then expanded in phase II. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability defined by the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in phase I, and antitumor activity assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) and immune-RECIST in phase II. RESULTS: Between April 17, 2019 and September 22, 2020, 54 patients with metastatic cancers were enrolled. Forty patients were treated with single agent OH2, and 14 with OH2 plus HX008. No DLTs were reported with single agent OH2 in phase I. Four patients, having metastatic mismatch repair-proficient rectal cancer or metastatic esophageal cancer, achieved immune-partial response, with two from the single agent cohort and two from the combination cohort. The duration of response were 11.25+ and 14.03+ months for the two responders treated with single agent OH2, and 1.38+ and 2.56+ months for the two responders in the combination cohort. The most common treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) with single agent OH2 was fever (n=18, 45.0%). All TRAEs were of grade 1–2, except one case of grade 3 fever in the 10(8)CCID50/mL group. No treatment-related serious AEs occurred. Single agent OH2 induced alterations in the tumor microenvironment, with clear increases in CD3(+) and CD8(+) cell density and programmed death-ligand 1 expression in the patients’ post-treatment biopsies relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral injection of OH2 was well-tolerated, and demonstrated durable antitumor activity in patients with metastatic esophageal and rectal cancer.

A major hurdle towards their commercialization is the production of large volumes of biomass at the correct time of year. Secondary metabolites are unstable and the “shelf-life” of bioactive microalgal biomass needs to be investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of storage conditions on freeze-dried microalgae to determine how long the biomass retained its growth promoting and bioactive properties under various temperature and light conditions. Chlorella vulgaris biomass was stored in the dark at − 70 °C, 10 °C, and 25 °C and in the light at 25 °C. Samples were tested every 3–4 months for 15 months. Storage time significantly influenced the rate of change in the bioactivity in the C. vulgaris biomass with storage temperature also having some effect. Rooting activity decreased in the mungbean rooting assay over time up to 12 months and then increased slightly. Antimicrobial activity increased against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for up to 12 months and then declined. Antioxidant activity measured in the DPPH assay remained relatively stable for up to 12 months and then significantly decreased with longer storage. The change in bioactivity over time was attributed to the gradual breakdown of the rigid cell wall of C. vulgaris, thereby improving extraction efficiency but exposing the secondary metabolites to oxygen, thus quickening their degradation. Biomass produced for commercial purposes requires preliminary validation as the results of the present study showed that bioactive compounds are susceptible to degradation over time.

There were significant correlations between AAT and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (correlation coefficient, 0.331; P < 0.001). However, the Cox model analysis, when adjusted for possible covariates including hsCRP, identified the fifth AAT quintile as a risk factor for all-cause death (hazard ratio, 2.12 [95% confidence interval, 1.41–3.18]; P < 0.001). An analysis of participants older than 50 years (hazard ratio, 1.98, P < 0.001) yielded similar results. The hazard ratio increased proportionately in combination with high AAT and high hsCRP levels, and the highest hazard ratio reached 4.51 (95% confidence interval, 3.14–6.54, P < 0.001). High AAT levels were determined to be an independent risk factor for mortality in the general population.","Tabara, Yasuharu; Setoh, Kazuya; Kawaguchi, Takahisa; Kosugi, Shinji; Nakayama, Takeo; Matsuda, Fumihiko",Sci Rep,315,20

The opening of the vaccination for these strata may play a key role in order to limit virus circulation, infection spreading towards the most vulnerable subjects, and plan safe school reopening. Vaccine hesitancy (VH) could limit the ability to reach the coverage threshold required to ensure herd immunity. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of VH among parents/guardians toward a potentially available COVID-19 vaccination for children and adolescents. An online survey was performed in parents/guardians of children aged <18 years old, living in Bologna. Overall, 5054 questionnaires were collected. A vast majority (60.4%) of the parents/guardians were inclined to vaccinate, while 29.6% were still considering the opportunity, and 9.9% were hesitant. Highest vaccine hesitancy rates were detected in female parents/guardians of children aged 6–10 years, ≤29 years old, with low educational level, relying on information found in the web/social media, and disliking mandatory vaccination policies. Although preliminary, these data could help in designing target strategies to implement adherence to a vaccination campaign, with special regard to web-based information.","Montalti, Marco; Rallo, Flavia; Guaraldi, Federica; Bartoli, Lapo; Po, Giulia; Stillo, Michela; Perrone, Paola; Squillace, Lorena; Dallolio, Laura; Pandolfi, Paolo; Resi, Davide; Fantini, Maria Pia; Reno, Chiara; Gori, Davide",Vaccines (Basel),315,20

The most commonly applied therapeutic intervention in cardiac rehabilitation is Schultz’s autogenic training, which has proven to be of little efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety disorders. At the same time, a growing number of scientific reports have been looking at the use of virtual reality (VR) to treat mental health problems. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of virtual therapy in reducing levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in female CVD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 43 women who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 17), where eight-week cardiac rehabilitation was enhanced with VR-based therapeutic sessions, and control group (N = 26), where the VR therapy was replaced with Schultz’s autogenic training. Mental state parameters were measured using the Perception of Stress Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In the experimental group, the sole parameter which failed to improve was HADS-Anxiety, which remained at the baseline level. In the control group, there was a deterioration in nearly all tested parameters except for HADS-Depression. Statistically significant differences in the efficacy of rehabilitation were recorded in relation to the level of stress in the sub-scales: emotional tension (p = 0.005), external stress (p = 0.012), intrapsychic stress (p = 0.023) and the generalized stress scale (p = 0.004). Conclusions: VR therapy is an efficient and interesting complement to cardiac rehabilitation, with proven efficacy in reducing stress levels.","Jóźwik, Sandra; Cieślik, Błażej; Gajda, Robert; Szczepańska-Gieracha, Joanna",Medicina (Kaunas),315,1

To elucidate its function in teleost fish, TRAF3 homologue of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame (ORF) of black carp TRAF3 (bcTRAF3) consists of 1722 nucleotides and bcTRAF3 contains 574 amino acids. bcTRAF3 protein migrated around 65 KDa in immunoblot analysis of both EPC and HEK293T cells. bcTRAF3 was identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to form aggregates or be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. It was interesting that both NF-κB and IFN transcription was activated by bcTRAF3 in reporter assay. When co-expressed with black carp STING (bcSTING), bcTRAF3 was redistributed in the cytoplasm and its subcellular location overlapped with that of bcSTING no matter what the cells was infected with GCRV or not, which suggested the association between these two molecules. bcSTING-mediated IFN production was up-regulated by bcTRAF3 in a dose dependent manner in reporter assay. Accordingly, EPC cells transfected with both bcSTING and bcTRAF3 showed enhanced antiviral activity comparing EPC cells expressing bcSTING alone. Taken together, the data generated in this paper supported the conclusion that bcTRAF3 was recruited into host innate immune activation and positively regulated bcSTING-mediated antiviral signaling.","Wang, Xu; Song, Xuejiao; Xie, Xinchi; Li, Wanzhen; Lu, Liang; Chen, Song; Wu, Hui; Feng, Hao",Dev Comp Immunol,315,15

There is, however, a lack of in-depth knowledge regarding the impact of the after effects of traumatic life experiences on eating behavior. Because eating behavior represents important components for promotion and maintenance of good health throughout life, this study aimed to explore inpatients’ lived experiences of the impact of traumatic stress on eating behavior. METHOD: Thirteen female and two male inpatients (age range 28–62 years), recruited from a psychiatric clinic in Norway, participated in this qualitative explorative focus group study. The data analysis was performed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: The results in the present study describe the participants’ experiences about the impact of traumatic stress on their eating behavior. Their discussions and descriptions disclosed problems that could be summarized into four main themes: “experiencing eating behaviors as coping strategies”; “experiencing being addicted to food and sweets”; “experiencing eating behaviors controlled by stress and emotions”; and “experiencing lack of appetite and reduced capacity to plan and prepare meals”. CONCLUSION: Traumatic stress can impact eating behavior in several complex ways that over time may cause adverse health consequences. The results add to an important understanding of changes in eating behavior that might appear in people struggling to cope with the after effects of traumatic life experiences to the existing literature. To better understand the complexity of how traumatic experiences may impact eating behavior, this knowledge is important and useful for health professionals offering support to those who experience struggling with eating behavior after traumatic experiences.","Roer, Grethe Emilie; Solbakken, Heidi Hurlen; Abebe, Dawit Shawel; Aaseth, Jan Olav; Bolstad, Ingeborg; Lien, Lars",J Eat Disord,315,17

Cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study, analyzing 12226 patients who required hospital admission in 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics of survivors versus non-survivors. The mean age of the study population was 67.5 ± 16.1 years, 42.6% were women. Overall, 2630 (21.5%) subjects died. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (50.9%) followed by diabetes (19.1%), and atrial fibrillation (11.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for gender (males, OR: 1.5, p = 0.0001), age tertiles (second and third tertiles, OR: 2.0 and 4.7, p = 0.0001), and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (second and third tertiles, OR: 4.7 and 8.1, p = 0.0001), hypertension was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality when this comorbidity was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR: 1.6, p = 0.002) or other than renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers (OR: 1.3, p = 0.001) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR: 1.2, p = 0.035). The preexisting condition of hypertension had an independent prognostic value for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization.

Also, a major impact on the individual and societal experience of death, dying, and bereavement has been observed. Factors such as social distancing, unexpected death or not being able to say goodbye, which might predict Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), are taking place. Moreover, hospitals have become a habitual place for End of Life (EOL) situations but not in the usual conditions because, for example, mitigation measures prevent families from being together with hospitalized relatives. Therefore, we implemented an EOL program with a multidisciplinary team involving health social workers (HSW) and clinical psychologists (CP) in coordination with the medical teams and nursing staff. Objectives: We aim to describe an EOL intervention program implemented during COVID-19 in the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (HUVH). We present its structure, circuit, and functions. Descriptive analyses of the sample and the interventions that required psychological and social attention are reported. Material and methods: The total sample consists of 359 relatives of 219 EOL patients. Inclusion criteria were families cared for during the COVID-19 pandemic with family patients admitted to the HUVH in an EOL situation regardless of whether or not the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Results: Our program is based on family EOL care perceptions and the COVID-19 context features that hinder EOL situations. The program attended 219 families, of which 55.3% were COVID-19 patients and 44.7% had other pathologies. The EOL intervention program was activated in most of the EOL situations, specifically, in 85% of cases, and 78% of relatives were able to come and say goodbye to their loved ones. An emotional impact on the EOL team was reported. It is necessary to dignify the EOL situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate psychosocial attention is needed to try to minimize future complications in grief processes and mitigate PGD.","Beneria, Anna; Castell-Panisello, Eudald; Sorribes-Puertas, Marta; Forner-Puntonet, Mireia; Serrat, Laia; García-González, Sara; Garriga, Maria; Simon, Carmen; Raya, Consuelo; Montes, Maria José; Rios, Giuliana; Bosch, Rosa; Citoler, Bárbara; Closa, Helena; Corrales, Montserrat; Daigre, Constanza; Delgado, Mercedes; Dip, Maria Emilia; Estelrich, Neus; Jacas, Carlos; Lara, Benjamin; Lugo-Marin, Jorge; Nieto-Fernández, Zaira; Regales, Christina; Ibáñez, Pol; Blanco, Eunice; Ramos-Quiroga, Josep Antoni",Front Psychiatry,315,26

The evaluation took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed us to monitor the effects of the spring 2020 lockdown in the Netherlands on substance trade via Telegram. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether changes in psychoactive substance trade on Telegram markets in the Netherlands can be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Between December 2, 2019, and June 29, 2020, a total of 70,226 posts appeared in two analyzed Telegram groups. A total of 5,643 posts were psychoactive substance related. Based on the analyzed posts, Telegram is mostly a ‘“sellers” market as only a minority of the posts (6.3%) could be identified as a request for a substance. The proportion of posts related to specific substances varied between the periods before, during, and after the lockdown. The proportion of posts on the stimulants ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamine was lower during the lockdown than before and after. For psychedelics − ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) − and other substances, there was a relative increase in the number of posts during the lockdown, which was maintained after the lockdown.

One result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the emergence of an urgent requirement for effective techniques and technologies for screening individuals showing symptoms of infection in a non-invasive and non-contact way. Systems that exploit thermal imaging technology to screen individuals show promise to satisfy the desired criteria, including offering a non-contact, non-invasive method of temperature measurement. Furthermore, the potential for mass and passive screening makes thermal imaging systems an attractive technology where current 'standard of care' methods are not practical. Critically, any fever screening solution must be capable of accurate temperature measurement and subsequent prediction of core temperature. This is essential to ensure a high sensitivity in identifying fever while maintaining a low rate of false positives. This paper discusses the results and analysis of a clinical trial undertaken by Thales UK Ltd and the Queen Elizabeth University Teaching Hospital in Glasgow to assess the accuracy and operation of the High Temperature Detection (HTD) system developed by Thales UK Ltd when used in a clinical setting. Results of this single centre prospective observational cohort study show that the measured laboratory accuracy of the Thales HTD system (RMSE=0.1{degrees}C) is comparable to the accuracy when used in a clinical setting (RMSE=0.15{degrees}C) when measuring a calibrated blackbody source at typical skin temperature. For measurement of forehead skin temperature, the system produced results commensurate with close contact measurement methods (R=0.86, Mean error = 0.05{degrees}C). Compared to measured tympanic temperatures, measurement of the forehead skin temperature by the HTD system showed a moderate correlation (R=0.43), which is stronger than close contact IR forehead thermometers (R=0.20, 0.35). An improved correlation was observed between the maximum facial temperature measured by the HTD system and measured tympanic temperatures (R=0.53), which is significantly stronger than the close contact methods. A linear predictive model for tympanic temperature based on the measured maximum facial temperatures resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE=0.50{degrees}C) that is marginally larger than what is expected as a compound of errors in the measuring devices (RMSE=0.45{degrees}C). The study demonstrates that the HTD could be applied in the clinical and non-clinical setting as a screening mechanism to detect citizens with raised temperature. This approach would enable high volume surveillance and identification of individuals that contribute to further spread of COVID-19. Deployment of the HTD system could be implemented as part of a screening tool to support measures to enhance public safety and confidence in areas of high throughput, such as airports, shopping centres or places of work.","Maguire, R.

The mortality rates vary across the countries probably due to the heterogeneity in study characteristics and patient cohorts as well as treatment strategies. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Istanbul, Turkey. Methods A total of 722 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this single-center retrospective study between March 15 and May 1, 2020. Results A total of 722 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. There were 235 (32.5%) elderly patients and 487 (67.5%) non-elderly patients. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (251 [34.8%]), diabetes mellitus (198 [27.4%]), and ischemic heart disease (66 [9.1%]). The most common symptoms were cough (512 [70.9%]), followed by fever (226 [31.3%]), and shortness of breath (201 [27.8%]). Lymphocytopenia was present in 29.7% of the patients, leukopenia in 12.2%, and elevated CRP in 48.8%. By the end of May 20, 648 (89.7%) patients had been discharged and 60 (8.5%) patients had died.

Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18–2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R(2) = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05).

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Model and Synthetic Data Set,15.320888,6.184387,2020-10-02,"Virus host shifts are a major source of outbreaks and emerging infectious diseases, and predicting the outcome of novel host and virus interactions remains a key challenge for virus research. The evolutionary relationships between host species can explain variation in transmission rates, virulence, and virus community composition between hosts, but it is unclear if correlations exist between related viruses in infection traits across novel hosts. Here, we measure correlations in viral load of four Cripavirus isolates across experimental infections of 45 Drosophilidae host species. We find positive correlations between every pair of viruses tested, suggesting that some host clades show broad susceptibility and could act as reservoirs and donors for certain types of viruses. Additionally, we find evidence of virus by host species interactions, highlighting the importance of both host and virus traits in determining the outcome of virus host shifts. Of the four viruses tested here, those that were more closely related tended to be more strongly correlated, providing tentative evidence that virus evolutionary relatedness may be a useful proxy for determining the likelihood of novel virus emergence, which warrants further research.","Imrie, Ryan M.; Roberts, Katherine E.; Longdon, Ben",Evol Lett,315,16

To investigate if mRNA secondary structure improves stability of the complex, we tested a pseudoknot, originating from the genomic RNA of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the positive-stranded coronavirus group. We used the previously-isolated anti-DNA scFv, 3D8, as a target protein. During in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we observed that incorporation of the pseudoknot into the mRNA resulted in production of a translational intermediate that corresponded to the expected size for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot. Complexes containing the mRNA pseudoknot exhibited a higher efficiency of affinity selection than that those without, indicating that the pseudoknot improves stability of the mRNA-ribosome-antibody complex in a eukaryotic translation system. Thus, in order to improve the efficiency of selection, this relatively short pseudoknot sequence could be incorporated into ribosome display.","Kim, Jong-Myung; Shin, Ho-Joon; Kim, Kyongmin; Lee, Myung-Shin",Mol Biotechnol,315,27

The analysis—which refers to a stated preference framework—contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether benefits resulting from reduced mortality risk should be valued differently depending on the age of the beneficiaries. By focussing on a life-threatening environmental phenomenon I show that the consideration of the individual’s age-specific hazard rate is important. If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is age-independent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age. The results provide an explanation for the mixed outcomes in empirical studies and illustrate in which cases an adjustment to age may or may not be justified. Efficient provision of live-saving measures requires that such differences to be taken into account.","Leiter, Andrea M.",Eur J Health Econ,315,16

BACKGROUND While vaccination prevents COVID-19, little is known about its impact on postoperative complications. METHODS This is a nationwide observational cohort study of all 1,255 Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide. We compared patients undergoing surgery at least 2 weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, to contemporary propensity score matched controls. Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and postoperative COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pulmonary or thrombotic complications, readmissions, and hospital lengths of stay. RESULTS 30,681 patients met inclusion criteria. After matching, there were 3,104 in the vaccination group (1,903 received the Pfizer BioNTech, and 1,201 received the Moderna vaccine) and 7,438 controls. Full COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower rates of postoperative 30-day COVID-19 infection (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR and 95% confidence intervals, 0.09 [0.01,0.44]), pulmonary complications (0.54 [0.39, 0.72]), thrombotic complications (0.68 [0.46, 0.99]) and decreased hospital lengths of stay (0.78 [0.69, 0.89]). Complications were also low in vaccinated patients who tested COVID-19 positive before surgery but events were too few to detect a significant difference compared to controls. CONCLUSION COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower rates of postoperative morbidity. The benefit is most pronounced among individuals who have never had a COVID-19 infection prior to surgery.","Prasad, Nikhil K; Lake, Rachel; Englum, Brian R; Turner, Douglas J; Siddiqui, Tariq; Mayorga-Carlin, Minerva; Sorkin, John D; Lal, Brajesh K",Annals of surgery,315,26

A few broad neutralization epitopes identified so far are present on the surface of native HIV-1 envelope spikes whose recognition by antibodies does not depend on conformational changes of the envelope spikes. However, HIV-1 envelope spikes also contain transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes, which are more difficult to identify. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed single chain Fvs (scFvs) derived from seven human monoclonal antibodies and genetically linked them with or without a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal. We show that with a GPI attachment signal the scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that four of the GPI-anchored scFvs, but not their secreted counterparts, neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPI-anchored scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GPI-anchored scFv (X5) in the lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4(+ )T cells confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus GPI-anchored scFv could be used as a general and effective way to identify antibodies that react with transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes in envelope proteins of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. The GPI-anchored scFv (X5), because of its breadth and potency, should have a great potential to be developed into anti-viral agent for HIV-1 prevention and therapy.","Wen, Michael; Arora, Reetakshi; Wang, Huiqiang; Liu, Lihong; Kimata, Jason T; Zhou, Paul",Retrovirology,315,16

We used the Open Dataset of Mexican patients with COVID-19 suspicion who had a definite RT-PCR result to develop a statistical model that evaluated the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. We included patients of all ages with every risk factor provided by the dataset: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and pregnancy. The dataset also included an unspecified category for other risk factors that were not specified as a single variable. To avoid excluding potential patients at risk, that category was included in our analysis. Due to the nature of the dataset, the calculation of a standardized comorbidity index was not possible. Therefore, we treated risk factors as a categorical variable with two categories: absence of risk factors and the presence of at least one risk factor in accordance with previous epidemiological reports. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to associate sex, risk factors, and age as a continuous variable (and the interaction that accounted for increasing diseases with older ages); and SARS-CoV-2 infection as the dependent zero-one binomial variable. Post estimation predictive marginal analysis was performed to generate probability trends along 95% confidence bands. This analysis was repeated several times through the course of the pandemic since the first record provided in their repository (April 12, 2020) to one month after the end of the state of sanitary emergency (the last date analyzed: June 27, 2020). After processing, the last measurement included 464,389 patients. The baseline analysis on April 12 revealed that people 35 years and older with at least one risk factor had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to patients without risk factors (Figure 1). One month before the end of the nationwide state of emergency this age threshold was found at 50 years (May 2, 2020) and it shifted to 65 years on May 30. Two weeks after the end of the public emergency (June 13, 2020) the trends converged at 80 years and one week later (June 27, 2020) every male and female patient with at least one risk factor had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without risk factors. Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all four probability curves shifted upwards as a result of progressive disease spread. In conclusion, we found our model could monitor accurately the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age, sex, and the presence of at least one risk factor. Also, because the model can be applied to any particular political region within Mexico, it could help evaluate the contagion spread in specific vulnerable populations. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying nature of the mechanisms behind such observations.","Leon-Abarca, J. A.",medRxiv,315,24

Objective of the Review: To review current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID-19 and place it in the context of known evidence-based management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ED. Discussion COVID-19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion. Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma. Conclusions High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) have a more limited role in COVID-19 due to risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases but can be considered. Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in prone position while awake. Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lung-protective volumes and low pressures. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be beneficial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia. Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation. Finally, patients with refractory severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 should be considered for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).","Wilcox, Susan R.; Condella, Anna",J Emerg Med,315,16

National Governments responded to the global crisis by implementing mobility restrictions to slow down the spread of the virus. To assess the impact of those policies on human mobility, we perform a massive comparative analysis on geolocalized data from 13 M Facebook users in France, Italy, and the UK. We find that lockdown generally affects national mobility efficiency and smallworldness—i.e., a substantial reduction of long-range connections in favor of local paths. The impact, however, differs among nations according to their mobility infrastructure. We find that mobility is more concentrated in France and UK and more distributed in Italy. In this paper we provide a framework to quantify the substantial impact of the mobility restrictions. We introduce a percolation model mimicking mobility network disruption and find that node persistence in the percolation process is significantly correlated with the economic and demographic characteristics of countries: areas showing higher resilience to mobility disruptions are those where Value Added per Capita and Population Density are high. Our methods and findings provide important insights to enhance preparedness for global critical events and to incorporate resilience as a relevant dimension to estimate the socio-economic consequences of mobility restriction policies.","Galeazzi, Alessandro; Cinelli, Matteo; Bonaccorsi, Giovanni; Pierri, Francesco; Schmidt, Ana Lucia; Scala, Antonio; Pammolli, Fabio; Quattrociocchi, Walter",Sci Rep,315,16

Nurses are world’s largest health professional workforce and a critical resource for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Nonetheless, little is known about nurses’ engagement with dual practice. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on nurses’ dual practice with the objective of generating hypotheses on its nature and consequences, and define a research agenda on the phenomenon. The Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological steps were followed to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/exclude studies, extract the data, and report the findings. PRISMA guidelines were additionally used to conduct the review and report on results. RESULTS: Of the initial 194 records identified, a total of 35 met the inclusion criteria for nurses’ dual practice; the vast majority (65%) were peer-reviewed publications, followed by nursing magazine publications (19%), reports, and doctoral dissertations. Twenty publications focused on high-income countries, 16 on low- or middle-income ones, and two had a multi country perspective. Although holding multiple jobs not always amounted to dual practice, several ways were found for public-sector nurses to engage concomitantly in public and private employments, in regulated as well as in informal, casual fashions. Some of these forms were reported as particularly prevalent, from over 50% in Australia, Canada, and the UK, to 28% in South Africa. The opportunity to increase a meagre salary, but also a dissatisfaction with the main job and the flexibility offered by multiple job-holding arrangements, were among the reported reasons for engaging in these practices. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Limited and mostly circumstantial evidence exists on nurses’ dual practice, with the few existing studies suggesting that the phenomenon is likely to be very common and carry implications for health systems and nurses’ welfare worldwide. We offer an agenda for future research to consolidate the existing evidence and to further explore nurses’ motivation; without a better understanding of nurse dual practice, this will continue to be a largely ‘hidden’ element in nursing workforce policy and practice, with an unclear impact on the delivery of care.

The model described below conceptually attempts to bridge the gap between toxicity and carcinogenicity of mineral fibres and has several implications: 1) it provides a tool to measure the toxicity and pathogenic potential of asbestos minerals, allowing a quantitative rank of the different types (e.g. chrysotile vs. crocidolite); 2) it can predict the toxicity and pathogenicity of “unregulated” or unclassified fibres; 3) it reveals the parameters of a mineral fibre that are active in stimulating key characteristics of cancer, thus offering a strategy for developing specific cancer prevention strategies and therapies. Chrysotile, crocidolite and fibrous glaucophane are described here as mineral fibres of interest.","Gualtieri, Alessandro F.",Curr Res Toxicol,315,20
