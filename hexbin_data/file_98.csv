168,Multiplex cytokine profile from dengue patients: MIP-1beta and IFN-gamma as predictive factors for severity,2008-06-25,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus pathogenesis is not yet fully understood and the identification of patients at high risk for developing severe disease forms is still a great challenge in dengue patient care. During the present study, we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity. METHODS: Seventeen-cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients. GLM models using bimodal or Gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis. RESULTS: IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-7 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations (severe dengue) when compared to mild disease forms (mild dengue). In contrast, increased MIP-1β levels were observed in patients with mild dengue. MIP-1β was also associated with CD56+NK cell circulating rates. IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and MCP-1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia. Increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF levels correlated with hypotension. Moreover, MIP-1β and IFN-γ were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the use of a multiple cytokine assay platform was suitable for identifying distinct cytokine profiles associated with the dengue clinical manifestations and severity. MIP-β is indicated for the first time as a good prognostic marker in contrast to IFN-γ that was associated with disease severity.","Bozza, Fernando A; Cruz, Oswaldo G; Zagne, Sonia MO; Azeredo, Elzinandes L; Nogueira, Rita MR; Assis, Edson F; Bozza, Patricia T; Kubelka, Claire F",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2474613/,98
1037,Myometrial cavernous hemangioma with pulmonary thromboembolism in a post-partum woman: a case report and review of the literature,2012-11-23,"INTRODUCTION: Cavernous hemangiomas of the uterus are rare benign vascular lesions. Nine cases of diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the gravid uterus have been reported, most of which diffusely involved the myometrium. These vascular malformations are clinically significant, and may cause pronounced bleeding resulting in maternal or fetal demise. Thrombosis of cavernous hemangiomas of the uterus has been previously reported. We here report the first case in which a thrombosed cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium resulted in a fatal pulmonary embolism in a post-partum woman. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old obese African-American woman who had one pregnancy and was delivered of twins by cesarean section was admitted 1 week after the successful delivery. The 12-day clinical course included ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, systemic hypertension, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum, leukocytosis and asystole. A transabdominal ultrasound examination showed heterogeneous thickened and irregular products in the endometrial canal. The laboratory values were relevant for an increased prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, ferritin and a decrease in hemoglobin. The clinical cause of death was cited as acute respiratory distress syndrome. At autopsy, a 400g spongy, hemorrhagic uterus with multiple cystic spaces measuring approximately 0.5 × 0.4cm filled with thrombi within the myometrium was identified. Immunohistological examination with a CD31 stain for vascular endothelium associated antigen confirmed several endothelium-lined vessels, some of which contained thrombi. These histological features were consistent with cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium. A histological examination of the lungs revealed multiple fresh thromboemboli in small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries in the right upper and lower lobes without organization, but with adjacent areas of fresh hemorrhagic infarction. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion in a pregnant or post-partum woman presenting with respiratory symptoms. Thrombosis of the cavernous hemangiomas of the gravid or post-partum uterus is a rare entity. This case is of interest because it indicates that this condition can be fatally complicated by embolization of the thrombi in the cavernous myometrial hemangiomas. Although delivery by conservative methods, as well as cesarean section, is possible without resorting to hysterectomy, occasionally, the consequences could be fatal as in this case.","Bhavsar, Tapan; Wurzel, John; Duker, Nahum",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543180/,98
1041,Influenza surveillance in the Pacific Island countries and territories during the 2009 pandemic: an observational study,2013-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Historically, Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) have been more severely affected by influenza pandemics than any other part of the world. We herein describe the emergence and epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in PICTs from 2009 to 2010. METHODS: The World Health Organization gathered reports of influenza-like-illness and laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases from all 23 Pacific island countries and territories, from April 2009 through August 2010. Data were gathered through weekly email reports from Pacific island countries and territories and through email or telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Pacific island countries and territories started detecting pandemic H1N1 cases in June 2009, firstly in French Polynesia, with the last new detection occurring in August 2009 in Tuvalu. Nineteen Pacific island countries and territories reported 1,972 confirmed cases, peaking in August 2009. No confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were identified in Niue, Pitcairn and Tokelau; the latter instituted strict maritime quarantine. Influenza-like-illness surveillance showed trends similar to surveillance of confirmed cases. Seven Pacific island countries and territories reported 21 deaths of confirmed pandemic H1N1. Case-patients died of acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, or both. The most reported pre-existing conditions were obesity, lung disease, heart disease, and pregnancy. Pacific island countries and territories instituted a variety of mitigation measures, including arrival health screening. Multiple partners facilitated influenza preparedness planning and outbreak response. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza spread rapidly throughout the Pacific despite enormous distances and relative isolation. Tokelau and Pitcairn may be the only jurisdictions to have remained pandemic-free. Despite being well-prepared, Pacific island countries and territories experienced significant morbidity and mortality, consistent with other indigenous and low-resource settings. For the first time, regional influenza-like-illness surveillance was conducted in the Pacific, allowing health authorities to monitor the pandemic’s spread and severity in real-time. Future regional outbreak responses will likely benefit from the lessons learned during this outbreak.","Kool, Jacobus Leen; Pavlin, Boris Igor; Musto, Jennie; Dawainavesi, Akanisi",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545879/,98
1874,Successful rescue of disseminated varicella infection with multiple organ failure in a pediatric living donor liver transplant recipient: a case report and literature review,2015-06-17,"A 12-year-old female patient with biliary atresia underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Twelve months after the LDLT, she developed acute hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase 584 IU/L) and was diagnosed with disseminated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection with high level of serum VZV-DNA (1.5 × 10(5) copies/mL) and generalized vesicular rash. She had received the VZV vaccination when she was 5-years-old and had not been exposed to chicken pox before the LDLT, and her serum was positive for VZV immunoglobulin G at the time of the LDLT. Although she underwent treatment with intravenous acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and withdrawal of immunosuppressants, her symptoms worsened and were accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, and encephalitis. These complications required treatment in the intensive care unit for 16 days. Five weeks later, her clinical findings improved, although her VZV-DNA levels remained high (8.5 × 10(3)copies/mL). Oral acyclovir was added for 2 weeks, and she was eventually discharged from our hospital on day 86 after admission; she has not experienced a recurrence. In conclusion, although disseminated VZV infection with multiple organ failure after pediatric LDLT is a life-threatening disease, it can be cured via an early diagnosis and intensive treatment.","Yamada, Naoya; Sanada, Yukihiro; Okada, Noriki; Wakiya, Taiichi; Ihara, Yoshiyuki; Urahashi, Taizen; Mizuta, Koichi",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480512/,98
1915,Safety and Immunogenicity of a Subvirion Monovalent Unadjuvanted Inactivated Influenza A(H3N2) Variant Vaccine in Healthy Persons ≥18 Years Old,2015-08-15,"BACKGROUND: Variant influenza A(H3N2) viruses (H3N2v) have transmitted recently from pigs to humans in the United States. Vaccines strategies are needed. METHODS: Healthy adults received 2 doses of subvirion H3N2v vaccine (15 µg of hemagglutinin/dose) 21 days apart in this open-label trial. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody (Ab) titers were measured before and 8 and 21 days after each dose. Memory B-cell (MBC) responses were assessed. RESULTS: Vaccine was well tolerated. A total of 40% of subjects had an HAI Ab titer of ≥40 before vaccination. Eight-seven percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 79%–93%) and 73% (95% CI, 63%–81%) of subjects 18–64 years old (98 subjects) and ≥65 years old (90 subjects), respectively, had an HAI titer of ≥40 21 days after dose 1 (P = .01); 51% (95% CI, 41%–61%) and 52% (95% CI, 41%–62%) of younger and older subjects, respectively, developed ≥4-fold rises in titer (P = not significant). Neut Ab response patterns were similar. Geometric mean titers were higher in younger subjects. Dose 2 provided no significant enhancement in responses. Cross-reactive MBCs were detected before vaccination and expanded after vaccination. Preexisting H3N2v-specific MBCs positively correlated with early increases in vaccine-induced Ab. CONCLUSIONS: In most healthy adults, one 15-µg dose of vaccine elicited levels of HAI Abs associated with protection. Studies in children and elderly individuals are indicated to define the immunization needs of these groups.

2690,Cytomegalovirus and Aspergillus spp. coinfection in organ transplantation: a case report and review of the literature,2012-11-09,"With the advent of potent immunosuppressive options, acute rejection episodes have decreased at the expense of increased incidence of opportunistic infections in solid organ recipients. In the absence of any preventive therapy, 30–75 % of transplant recipients develop cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. account for more than 80 % of invasive fungal infections in solid organ recipients. This co-occurrence of two commonly seen opportunistic infections may end up in fatality. Here, we present a case of concomitant Aspergillus spp. and CMV infection and discuss the relevant literature. A 54-year-old male patient presented with fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain on the 9th posttransplant week after renal transplantation. CMV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 1,680,000 copies/ml, thus, valganciclovir dose was increased. There were inspiratory crackles at both lung bases, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple fungal balls throughout the right lung. Galactomannan antigen was positive, and voriconazole and other antimicrobials were subsequently added to the treatment. At the end of the therapy, on control CT, pneumonic consolidation had disappeared, sputum cultures didn’t show Aspergillus spp., and CMV-DNA reduced to 700 copies/ml. The patient showed a favorable clinical response to combined treatment; fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain disappeared. Both CMV disease and aspergillosis may present as pulmonary disease; thus, the characterization of one may not preclude the search for the other and the timely initiation of treatment is of paramount importance for good outcomes.","Solak, Yalcin; Biyik, Zeynep; Cizmecioglu, Ahmet; Genc, Nejdet; Ozbek, Orhan; Gaipov, Abduzhappar; Yeksan, Mehdi",CEN Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413728/,98
2802,Role of eculizumab in a pediatric refractory gemcitabine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy: a case report,2017-07-27,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome has already been described in adults. Several approaches have been employed in the treatment of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome with different outcomes. One of the most promising agents is eculizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody directed against C5 complement protein. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported the case of a 3-year-old white boy with medulloblastoma who underwent high-dose chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. Afterwards he started maintenance chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. After five courses he presented a progressive clinical worsening, which resulted in a systemic thrombotic microangiopathy. Initially he was treated with rituximab without clinical improvement. Therefore he started therapy with repeated cycles of eculizumab. After seven infusions he showed a gradual improvement and finally a complete remission of gemcitabine-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Eculizumab prevents serious complement-mediated vascular damage for chemotherapy-induced thrombotic microangiopathy in pediatric cases.","Facchini, Ludovica; Lucchesi, Maurizio; Stival, Alessia; Roperto, Rosa Maria; Melosi, Francesca; Materassi, Marco; Farina, Silvia; Tintori, Veronica; de Martino, Maurizio; Sardi, Iacopo",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5530476/,98
3093,Clinical characteristics from co-infection with avian influenza A H7N9 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae: a case report,2018-03-15,"BACKGROUND: More and more cases of human infections with avian influenza A H7N9 have been reported since it was first mentioned in 2013 in China, but concurrence of influenza A H7N9 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, however, has never been described. Here, we reported the case of a woman co-infected by influenza A H7N9 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, whose treatment process was a little bit longer and a little bit complicated as well. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was an 80-year-old Chinese woman who presented with fever, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. A computed tomography scan showed obvious infiltrations at lower parts of both lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis confirmed a severe respiratory failure (type I). Her sputum and throat swabs were checked for nucleic acid of influenza A and the result was positive for influenza A H7N9. She was diagnosed as having severe influenza A H7N9 and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was admitted to an intensive care unit. She was given comprehensive treatment, including oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, gastric protection, and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Her condition improved 4 days later. However, some symptoms exacerbated again 2 days later with ground-glass changes appearing in upper area of right lung and the titer of antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae rising from 1:80 to 1:640. She was reasonably considered to be infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well, and azithromycin and moxifloxacin were added to her treatment. Oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9, but anti-Mycoplasma treatment was continued. Although her symptoms and abnormal changes on computed tomography scan slowly went away, she finally recovered from the mixed infection after a total of 33 days of management. CONCLUSION: In patients with confirmed influenza A H7N9 infection whose condition worsens again, especially with new infiltration or lung ground-glass infiltration, one should suspect infection by other pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.","Luo, Haili; Wang, Shaohong; Yuan, Tongmei; Liu, Jingtao; Yao, Ling; Pan, Xianguo; Long, Xuemei; Wu, Juncheng; Shen, Feng",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5853085/,98
3802,Acute pancreatitis and vasoplegic shock associated with leptospirosis – a case report and review of the literature,2019-05-08,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis or Weil’s disease is caused by pathogenic spirochete bacteria called Leptospira. It is considered the most common zoonosis in the world and is usually transmitted by urine of rodents and dogs with an incubation time of 7–14 days. The clinical spectrum ranges from a subclinical infection to a fulminant septic course. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the case of a German patient with acute pancreatitis associated with Leptospira interrogans causing fulminant septic shock. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics and left the hospital fully recovered after 18 days. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of leptospirosis with acute pancreatitis as the leading clinical manifestation in Central Europe. Serologic and molecular genetic tests for leptospirosis should be considered, if no other causes for pancreatitis can be identified.","Maier, Alexander; Kaeser, Rafael; Thimme, Robert; Boettler, Tobias",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6507051/,98
4314,"Molecular characterization of Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from pregnant women and newborns at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia",2020-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalctiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a perinatal pathogen and a leading cause of neonatal infections worldwide. Serotype, sequence type, clonality, antibiotic resistance genes and surface protein profiles of GBS are scarce in Ethiopia, a reason that this study was planned to investigate. . METHODS: Sixteen colonizing GBS isolates obtained from recto-vaginal swabs of pregnant women and body surfaces of newborns were further analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, and whole genome sequence (WGS) methods were done for antibiotic susceptibility test, and molecular characterization of the isolates. RESULTS: All the GBS isolates analyzed were belonged to four capsular serotypes: II, 11/16(68.8%), V, 3/16(18.8%), Ia and VI each with 1/16(6.3%) and five sequence type (ST-2, ST-10, ST-14, ST-569 and ST-933). Sequence type-10 was the most predominant ST followed by ST-569. The five STs were grouped into the four clonal complexes (CC - 1, CC-10, CC-19, and CC-23). Different surface proteins and pili families such as ALP1, ALPHA, ALP23, PI-1 / PI-2A1, PI-1 / PI-2B, and Srr1 were detected from WGS data. All isolates were found to be susceptible to the tested antibiotics except for tetracycline in MIC and WGS test methods used. Tetracycline resistant determinant genes such as TETM and TETL / TETM combination were identified. CONCLUSION: Further studies on serotype and molecular epidemiology will provide a comprehensive data of the GBS capsular serotype and clones available in Ethiopia.","Gizachew, Mucheye; Tiruneh, Moges; Moges, Feleke; Adefris, Mulat; Tigabu, Zemene; Tessema, Belay",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958622/,98
4491,The role of hospital environment in transmissions of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms,2020-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged and difficult weaning is associated with higher rates of complications and mortality. Therefore, it is important to identify the associated factors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe our experience with a 37-year-old man diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (influenza A). He presented with acute respiratory failure type I on admission. During intubation, his blood pressure and heart rate decreased, and epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered. Although his clinical condition improved 8 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he experienced difficulty weaning. He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength. His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an Arnold–Chiari malformation type I, posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, and syringomyelia, with compression and deformation of the medulla and high cervical cord. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator at 20 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Arnold–Chiari malformation type I and posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, which aggravate medullary compression and increase the risk of cervical nerve injury, might be a rare factor affecting prolonged weaning in critical illness.","Ding, Renyu; Meng, Yulan; Jia, Xingjuan; Ma, Xiaochun",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014774/,98
4807,The role of mini-bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in critically ill patients,2020-03-18,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are wide-spread among the general population with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe developmental disabilities in newborns and life-threatening illnesses in individuals with a compromised immune system. Nearly all current drugs suffer from one or more limitations, which emphasizes the critical need to develop new approaches and new molecules. We reasoned that a ‘poly-pharmacy’ approach relying on simultaneous binding to multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells could pave the way to a more effective therapeutic outcome. This work presents the study of a synthetic, small molecule displaying pleiotropicity of interactions as a competitive antagonist of viral or cell surface receptors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate-binding proteins, which play important roles in HCMV entry and spread. Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG), a functional mimetic of heparan sulfate, inhibits HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts and neuroepithelioma cells with high potency. At the same time, SPGG exhibits no toxicity at levels as high as 50-fold more than its inhibition potency. Interestingly, cell-ELISA assays showed downregulation in HCMV immediate-early gene 1 and 2 (IE 1&2) expression in presence of SPGG further supporting inhibition of viral entry. Finally, HCMV foci were observed to decrease significantly in the presence of SPGG suggesting impact on viral spread too. Overall, this work offers the first evidence that pleiotropicity, such as demonstrated by SPGG, may offer a new poly-therapeutic approach toward effective inhibition of HCMV.","Elste, James; Kaltenbach, Dominik; Patel, Vraj R.; Nguyen, Max T.; Sharthiya, Harsh; Tandon, Ritesh; Mehta, Satish K.; Volin, Michael V.; Fornaro, Michele; Tiwari, Vaibhav; Desai, Umesh R.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084493/,98
7290,Characterization of epithelial IL-8 response to inflammatory bowel disease mucosal E. coli and its inhibition by mesalamine,2008-02-01,"Two experimental types of cigarette sidestream smoke (SS) were compared in a subchronic inhalation study on rats. Fresh SS (FSS) was generated continuously from the reference cigarette 2R1. Room-aged SS (RASS) was generated by aging FSS for 1.5 h in a room with noninert surfaces with materials typically found in residences or offices. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were head-only exposed to three dose levels of each SS type and to filtered, conditioned fresh air (sham-exposure) for 6 h/day, 7 days/week, for 90 days. Room-aging resulted in decreased concentrations of various SS components, e.g., total participate matter (TPM) and nicotine, while other components, such as carbon monoxide (CO), were not affected. The CO concentrations were 6, 13, and 28 ppm for both SS types. TPM concentrations were between 0.6 and 8.7 (μg/liter and thus up to 100-fold above the maximum of average concentrations of respiratory suspended particles reported for environmental tobacco smoke. Slight reserve cell hyperplasia in the anterior part of the nose as well as hyperplastic and metaplastic epithelial changes in the larynx were the only observed dose-dependent findings. The metabolism of benzo(a)-pyrene-as a proxy for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism-was induced in the nasal respiratory epithelium and in the lungs while no effect was seen in the nasal olfactory epithelium. The lowest-observed effect level was 6 ppm CO or 0.6 μg TPM/liter. Most of the effects seen were less expressed in RASS- than in FSS-exposed rats when compared on the basis of the CO concentrations. When compared on the basis of TPM, these effects were equally pronounced for both SS types, suggesting a major role of particulate matter-associated compounds. All findings reverted to sham control levels following a 42-day postinhalation period.","Haussmann, HANS-Jü.rgen; Anskeit, Erwin; Becker, Dorothea; Kuhl, Peter; Stinn, Walter; Teredesai, Ashok; Voncken, Peter; Walk, Rüdiger-Alexander",Toxicol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108658/,98

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed in an 11-bed, level 3 pediatric intensive care unit. Evaluation was made of 30 pediatric patients receiving airway pressure release ventilation as rescue therapy for severe ARDS. RESULTS: Patients were switched to APRV on an average 3.2 ± 2.6 d following intubation. When changed from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) to APRV, there was an expected increase in the SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (165.1 ± 13.6 vs. 131.7 ± 10.2; p = 0.035). Mean peak inspiratory pressure was significantly lower during APRV (25.4 ± 1.26 vs. 29.8 ± 0.60, p < 0.001) compared to CMV prior to APRV but mean airway pressure (P(aw)) was significantly higher during APRV (19.1 ± 0.9 vs. 15.3 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). Hospital mortality in this study group was 16.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the hypothesis that APRV may offer potential clinical advantages for ventilatory management and may be considered as an alternative rescue mechanical ventilation mode in pediatric ARDS patients refractory to conventional ventilation.","Yener, Nazik; Üdürgücü, Muhammed",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223785/,98

A possible link between community and suicide is social capital imprinted in social connectedness. This study explores whether social capital is protective against suicide ideation in relation to the poverty level of communities, and whether the associations are specific to certain elements of social capital. A total of 908 participants were included to assess cross-sectional association of social capital at individual level with suicide ideation by comparing between poor (government-leased apartments) and non-poor communities (nongovernment-leased apartments). Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine various social capital dimensions in relation to suicide ideation. Suicide ideation was far higher among those living in the poor communities (poor communities 12%; non poor communities 6.3%) and the level of social capital was lower in the poor communities. Nevertheless, the protective effect of social capital, in particular, the cognitive dimension against suicide ideation was demonstrated only in the poor communities (eg, odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.12–0.58 for trust in the poor communities). Low income was significantly associated with suicide ideation only in the poor communities, but depression and resilience were associated with suicide ideation both in the poor and non-poor communities. To increase the reliability of the results, established measures based on relevant literature were utilized, but measures on bridging social capital and social network might have relatively low reliability. As to protection against suicide ideation, the extent of reliance on social capital was higher in poor communities than in non-poor communities, in particular, the cognitive dimension was likely to activate in this regard.","Choi, Minjae; Ki, Myung; Yip, Paul S.F.; Park, Jungyoun; Song, Areum; Lee, Weon Young; Paik, Jong-Woo; Lim, Jiseun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598880/,98

Further they are associated with high morbidity and mortality from treatment failure. Therapy involves multiple rounds of ineffective antibiotics alongside unwanted side effects, alternative treatments are crucial. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a natural, vegan product that has been shown to have powerful antimicrobial activity hence we investigated whether ACV could ameliorate these resistant bacteria. The minimum dilution of ACV required for growth inhibition was comparable for both bacteria (1/25 dilution of ACV liquid and ACV tablets at 200 µg/ml were effective against rE. coli and MRSA). Monocyte co-culture with microbes alongside ACV resulted in an increase in monocyte phagocytosis by 21.2% and 33.5% compared to non-ACV treated but MRSA or rE. coli stimulated monocytes, respectively. Label free quantitative proteomic studies of microbial protein extracts demonstrated that ACV penetrated microbial cell membranes and organelles, altering the expression of key proteins. This resulted in significant reductions in total protein expression, moreover we could only detect ribosomal proteins; 50 s 30 s, enolase, phosphenol pyruvate and the ATP synthase subunit in rE. coli.

15611,The COVID-19 exit strategy—why we need to aim low,2021-02-11,"Delivery of medications to preterm neonates receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) represents one of the most challenging scenarios for aerosol medicine. This challenge is highlighted by the undersized anatomy and the complex (patho)physiological characteristics of the lungs in such infants. Key physiological restraints include low lung volumes, low compliance, and irregular respiratory rates, which significantly reduce lung deposition. Such factors are inherent to premature birth and thus can be regarded to as the intrinsic factors that affect lung deposition. However, there are a number of extrinsic factors that also impact lung deposition: such factors include the choice of aerosol generator and its configuration within the ventilation circuit, the drug formulation, the aerosol particle size distribution, the choice of NIV type, and the patient interface between the delivery system and the patient. Together, these extrinsic factors provide an opportunity to optimize the lung deposition of therapeutic aerosols and, ultimately, the efficacy of the therapy. In this review, we first provide a comprehensive characterization of both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting lung deposition in premature infants, followed by a revision of the clinical attempts to deliver therapeutic aerosols to premature neonates during NIV, which are almost exclusively related to the non-invasive delivery of surfactant aerosols. In this review, we provide clues to the interpretation of existing experimental and clinical data on neonatal aerosol delivery and we also describe a frame of measurable variables and available tools, including in vitro and in vivo models, that should be considered when developing a drug for inhalation in this important but under-served patient population.","Bianco, Federico; Salomone, Fabrizio; Milesi, Ilaria; Murgia, Xabier; Bonelli, Sauro; Pasini, Elena; Dellacà, Raffaele; Ventura, Maria Luisa; Pillow, Jane",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908012/,98

From a public health perspective, emphasis has been placed on addressing vitamin D deficiency through dietary means. However, naturally rich food sources of vitamin D are few and infrequently consumed, and nutrition survey data from various countries have indicated that habitual vitamin D intakes in the community are much lower than the current vitamin D dietary guidelines. This review will briefly overview the extent of vitamin D deficiency within the community, its causes, and how our food chain, once its embraces the evidence-based practise of food fortification and potentially biofortification, can cater for meeting the dietary vitamin D needs of the community. Finally, international authorities, briefed with establishing vitamin D dietary guidelines over the past decade, have struggled with uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of the relative contribution of sunshine and diet to vitamin D status and vitamin D requirements for health maintenance. The review will also consider how emerging evidence of a possible minimal-risk UVB radiation exposure relative to skin cancer that also enables vitamin D production could greatly inform future vitamin D dietary guidelines.","Cashman, Kevin D.",Photochem Photobiol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047520/,98

As an emerging class of non-linear regulatory RNA molecules, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have gained increasing attention as a crucial player in the regulation of signaling pathways involved in viral infection and oncogenesis. With the assistance of current circRNA enrichment and detection technologies, numerous novel virally-encoded circRNAs (vcircRNAs) have been identified in the human oncogenic viruses, initiating an exciting new era of vcircRNA research. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the roles of vcircRNAs in the respective viral infection cycles and in virus-associated pathogenesis.","Avilala, Janardhan; Becnel, David; Abdelghani, Ramsy; Nanbo, Asuka; Kahn, Jacob; Li, Li; Lin, Zhen",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093803/,98

This review highlighted the chemistry and biology of alkaloids isolated from twenty-six fungal genera associated with marine organisms and marine sea sediments. The selected fungi are from different marine sources without focusing on mangroves. The studied fungal genera comprises Acrostalagmus, Arthrinium, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Coniothyrium, Curvularia, Dichotomomyces, Eurotium, Eutypella, Exophiala, Fusarium, Hypocrea, Microsphaeropsis, Microsporum, Neosartorya, Nigrospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Pleosporales, Pseudallescheria, Scedosporium, Scopulariopsis, Stagonosporopsis, Thielavia, Westerdykella, and Xylariaceae. Around 347 alkaloid metabolites were isolated and identified via chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques comprising 1D and 2D NMR (one and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance) which were further confirmed using HR-MS (high resolution mass spectrometry) and Mosher reactions for additional ascertaining of the stereochemistry. About 150 alkaloids showed considerable effect with respect to the tested activities. Most of the reported bioactive alkaloids showed considerable biological activities mainly cytotoxic followed by antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant; however, a few showed anti-inflammatory and antifouling activities. However, the rest of the compounds showed weak or no activity toward the tested biological activities and required further investigations for additional biological activities. Thus, alkaloids isolated from marine-associated fungi can afford an endless source of new drug entities that could serve as leads for drug discovery combating many human ailments.","Youssef, Fadia S.; Simal-Gandara, Jesus",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145996/,98
18611,A Prospective Study of Etiological Agents Among Febrile Patients in Sierra Leone,2021-06-26,"The quest for a chemical surfactant substitute has been fuelled by increased environmental awareness. The benefits that biosurfactants present like biodegradability, and biocompatibility over their chemical and synthetic counterparts has contributed immensely to their popularity and use in various industries such as petrochemicals, mining, metallurgy, agrochemicals, fertilizers, beverages, cosmetics, etc. With the growing demand for biosurfactants, researchers are looking for low-cost waste materials to use them as substrates, which will lower the manufacturing costs while providing waste management services as an add-on benefit. The use of low-cost substrates will significantly reduce the cost of producing biosurfactants. This paper discusses the use of various feedstocks in the production of biosurfactants, which not only reduces the cost of waste treatment but also provides an opportunity to profit from the sale of the biosurfactant. Furthermore, it includes state-of-the-art information about employing municipal solid waste as a sustainable feedstock for biosurfactant production, which has not been simultaneously covered in many published literatures on biosurfactant production from different feedstocks. It also addresses the myriad of other issues associated with the processing of biosurfactants, as well as the methods used to address these issues and perspectives, which will move society towards cleaner production.","Mohanty, Swayansu Sabyasachi; Koul, Yamini; Varjani, Sunita; Pandey, Ashok; Ngo, Huu Hao; Chang, Jo-Shu; Wong, Jonathan W.

The recent M3.5 and M3.4 earthquakes of 12th April 2020 and 10th May 2020 respectively in northeast Delhi and M4.4 earthquake of 29th May 2020 near Rohtak (~ 50 km west of Delhi), followed by more than a dozen aftershocks, created panic in this densely populated habitat. The past seismic history and the current activity emphasize the need to revisit the subsurface structural setting and its association with the seismicity of the region. Fault plane solutions are determined using data collected from a dense network in Delhi region. The strain energy released in the last two decades is also estimated to understand the subsurface structural environment. Based on fault plane solutions, together with information obtained from strain energy estimates and the available geophysical and geological studies, it is inferred that the Delhi region is sitting on two contrasting structural environments: reverse faulting in the west and normal faulting in the east, separated by the NE-SW trending Delhi Hardwar Ridge/Mahendragarh-Dehradun Fault (DHR-MDF). The WNW-ESE trending Delhi Sargoda Ridge (DSR), which intersects DHR-MDF in the west, is inferred as a thrust fault. The transfer of stress from the interaction zone of DHR-MDF and DSR to nearby smaller faults could further contribute to the scattered shallow seismicity in Delhi region.","Bansal, Brijesh K.; Mohan, Kapil; Verma, Mithila; Sutar, Anup K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8257579/,98

In the scientific community, the climate change debate has shifted from focusing on establishing the truth of the claim that climate change is a reality to warming public opinion to the cause and acknowledging that climate change will have far-reaching effects on how we build, organize and manage climate-responsive social systems including health care systems. There is particular urgency to the debate for health services and systems in low income countries where some of the worst effects of climate change will be felt and where health systems are already over-stretched due to long-term lack of investment, a double burden of disease (preventive and non-communicable), a crisis in human resources and governance deficiencies. Despite the urgency, the health care systems development community appears insular in its interests and actions, and a clear leader that could coordinate the activities of different researchers, research bodies, policy makers and international organizations across relevant sectors including disaster management, climate and health care systems, has yet to emerge. This essay considers the political landscape, possible leaders and why it is necessary for health systems’ professionals to move beyond the health sector in order to secure support for health and health care systems development in a post-Millennium Development Goals development framework that is defined by climate change.","Mayhew, Susannah; Belle, Sara Van; Hammer, Michael",J Health Serv Res Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261385/,98

Many of these are ripe and ready to be used by the proteomics community outside of the PRN specialists. In this paper we present software which collects an ensemble of (network) methods tailored towards the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and/or interactions of proteins with ligands of other type, e.g. nucleic acids, oligosaccharides etc. In parallel, we propose the use of the network differential analysis as a method to identify residues mediating key interactions between proteins. We use a model system, to show that in combination with other, already published methods, also included in pyProGA, it can be used to make such predictions. Such extended repertoire of methods allows to cross-check predictions with other methods as well, as we show here. In addition, the possibility to construct PRN models from various kinds of input is so far a unique asset of our code. One can use structural data as defined in PDB files and/or from data on residue pair interaction energies, either from force-field parameters or fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. pyProGA is a free open-source software available from https://gitlab.com/Vlado_S/pyproga.","Sladek, Vladimir; Yamamoto, Yuta; Harada, Ryuhei; Shoji, Mitsuo; Shigeta, Yasuteru; Sladek, Vladimir",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323899/,98

This literature review aims to understand the impact of patients' disease on family members across all medical specialities, and appraise existing generic and disease-specific family quality of life (QoL) measures. METHODS: The databases Medline, EMBASE, CINHAL, ASSIA, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for original articles in English measuring the impact of health conditions on patients' family members/partner using a valid instrument. RESULTS: Of 114 articles screened, 86 met the inclusion criteria. They explored the impact of a relative's disease on 14,661 family members, mostly 'parents' or 'mothers', using 50 different instruments across 18 specialities including neurology, oncology and dermatology, in 33 countries including the USA, China and Australia. These studies revealed a huge impact of patients' illness on family members. An appraisal of family QoL instruments identified 48 instruments, 42 disease/speciality specific and six generic measures. Five of the six generics are aimed at carers of children, people with disability or restricted to chronic disease. The only generic instrument that measures the impact of any condition on family members across all specialities is the Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16). Although most instruments demonstrated good reliability and validity, only 11 reported responsiveness and only one reported the minimal clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Family members' QoL is greatly impacted by a relative's condition. To support family members, there is a need for a generic tool that offers flexibility and brevity for use in clinical settings across all areas of medicine. FROM-16 could be the tool of choice, provided its robustness is demonstrated with further validation of its psychometric properties.

Therefore, we conducted this e-survey to assess the prevalence and identify the determinants of the availability of spine surgery navigation techniques in Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-part questionnaire was disseminated amongst African neurological and orthopedic surgery consultants and trainees from January 24 to February 23, 2021. The Chi-Square, Fisher Exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate bivariable relationships, and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We had 113 respondents from all regions of Africa. Most (86.7 %) participants who practiced or trained in public centers and centers had an annual median spine case surgery volume of 200 (IQR = 190) interventions. Fluoroscopy was the most prevalent spine surgery navigation technique (96.5 %), followed by freehand (55.8 %), stereotactic without intraoperative CT scan (31.9 %), robotic with intraoperative CT scan (29.2 %), stereotactic with intraoperative CT scan (8.8 %), and robotic without intraoperative CT scan (6.2 %). Cost of equipment (94.7 %), lack of trained staff to service (63.7 %), or run the equipment (60.2 %) were the most common barriers to the availability of spine instrumentation navigation.

20158,A highly effective and inexpensive standardized treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a multicenter prospective study in China,2021-08-19,"Over the last decade the availability of SNP-trait associations from genome-wide association studies has led to an array of methods for performing Mendelian randomization studies using only summary statistics. A common feature of these methods, besides their intuitive simplicity, is the ability to combine data from several sources, incorporate multiple variants and account for biases due to weak instruments and pleiotropy. With the advent of large and accessible fully-genotyped cohorts such as UK Biobank, there is now increasing interest in understanding how best to apply these well developed summary data methods to individual level data, and to explore the use of more sophisticated causal methods allowing for non-linearity and effect modification. In this paper we describe a general procedure for optimally applying any two sample summary data method using one sample data. Our procedure first performs a meta-analysis of summary data estimates that are intentionally contaminated by collider bias between the genetic instruments and unmeasured confounders, due to conditioning on the observed exposure. These estimates are then used to correct the standard observational association between an exposure and outcome. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the method’s performance against naive applications of two sample summary data MR. We apply the approach to the UK Biobank cohort to investigate the causal role of sleep disturbance on HbA1c levels, an important determinant of diabetes. Our approach can be viewed as a generalization of Dudbridge et al. (Nat. Comm. 10: 1561), who developed a technique to adjust for index event bias when uncovering genetic predictors of disease progression based on case-only data. Our work serves to clarify that in any one sample MR analysis, it can be advantageous to estimate causal relationships by artificially inducing and then correcting for collider bias.","Barry, Ciarrah; Liu, Junxi; Richmond, Rebecca; Rutter, Martin K.; Lawlor, Deborah A.; Dudbridge, Frank; Bowden, Jack",PLoS Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8376220/,98

Patients with CLD are particularly susceptible to hemodynamic derangements given their low systemic vascular resistance state. Accordingly, hypotension is common in this setting. The hemodynamic effects of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing elective liver transplantation are unknown, therefore we evaluated whether the intraoperative administration of IV paracetamol in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing liver transplantation results in adverse hemodynamic effects. The primary end point was a change in systolic blood pressure 30-min after the preoperative infusion. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants undergoing liver transplantation surgery were randomly assigned to receive a single bolus of IV paracetamol (1 g paracetamol + 3.91 g mannitol per 100 mL) (n = 12) or placebo (0.9% Saline 100 mL) (n = 12). All participants completed their study intervention, and there were no breaches or violations of the trial protocol. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences regarding surgical duration, intraoperative use of fluids, and intraoperative noradrenaline use.

20784,Hard bilateral syphilitic testes with vasculitis: a case report and literature review,2021-09-03,"Here the hypothesis that linearized esculentin 2EM (E2EM-lin) from Glandirana emeljanovi possesses pH dependent activity is investigated. The peptide showed weak activity against Gram-negative bacteria (MLCs ≥ 75.0 μM) but potent efficacy towards Gram-positive bacteria (MLCs ≤ 6.25 μM). E2EM-lin adopted an α-helical structure in the presence of bacterial membranes that increased as pH was increased from 6 to 8 (↑ 15.5–26.9%), whilst similar increases in pH enhanced the ability of the peptide to penetrate (↑ 2.3–5.1 mN m(−1)) and lyse (↑ 15.1–32.5%) these membranes. Theoretical analysis predicted that this membranolytic mechanism involved a tilted segment, that increased along the α-helical long axis of E2EM-lin (1–23) in the N → C direction, with − < µH > increasing overall from circa − 0.8 to − 0.3. In combination, these data showed that E2EM-lin killed bacteria via novel mechanisms that were enhanced by alkaline conditions and involved the formation of tilted and membranolytic, α-helical structure. The preference of E2EM-lin for Gram-positive bacteria over Gram-negative organisms was primarily driven by the superior ability of phosphatidylglycerol to induce α-helical structure in the peptide as compared to phosphatidylethanolamine. These data were used to generate a novel pore-forming model for the membranolytic activity of E2EM-lin, which would appear to be the first, major reported instance of pH dependent AMPs with alkaline optima using tilted structure to drive a pore-forming process. It is proposed that E2EM-lin has the potential for development to serve purposes ranging from therapeutic usage, such as chronic wound disinfection, to food preservation by killing food spoilage organisms.

A possible reason is the context-dependent role of Notch in the cardiovascular system, which would require a finely tuned, cell-specific approach. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short functional endogenous, non-coding RNA sequences able to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels influencing most, if not all, biological processes. Dysregulation of miRNAs expression is implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying many CVDs. Notch is regulated and regulates a large number of miRNAs expressed in the cardiovascular system and, thus, targeting these miRNAs could represent an avenue to be explored to target Notch for CVDs. In this Review, we provide an overview of both established and potential, based on evidence in other pathologies, crosstalks between miRNAs and Notch in cellular processes underlying atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, calcification of aortic valve, and arrhythmias.

Defining subphenotypes with distinct prognoses or biologic features can improve therapeutic trials, but prior work has focused on ARDS, which excludes many acute HRF patients. We aimed to characterize persistent and resolving subphenotypes in the broader HRF population. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of 2 independent prospective ICU cohorts, we included adults with acute HRF, defined by invasive mechanical ventilation and PaO(2)-to-FIO(2) ratio ≤ 300 on cohort enrollment (n = 768 in the discovery cohort and n = 1715 in the validation cohort). We classified patients as persistent HRF if still requiring mechanical ventilation with PaO(2)-to-FIO(2) ratio ≤ 300 on day 3 following ICU admission, or resolving HRF if otherwise. We estimated relative risk of 28-day hospital mortality associated with persistent HRF, compared to resolving HRF, using generalized linear models. We also estimated fold difference in circulating biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation on cohort enrollment among persistent HRF compared to resolving HRF. Finally, we stratified our analyses by ARDS to understand whether this was driving differences between persistent and resolving HRF. RESULTS: Over 50% developed persistent HRF in both the discovery (n = 386) and validation (n = 1032) cohorts. Persistent HRF was associated with higher risk of death relative to resolving HRF in both the discovery (1.68-fold, 95% CI 1.11, 2.54) and validation cohorts (1.93-fold, 95% CI 1.50, 2.47), after adjustment for age, sex, chronic respiratory illness, and acute illness severity on enrollment (APACHE-III in discovery, APACHE-II in validation). Patients with persistent HRF displayed higher biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin-6, interleukin-8) and endothelial dysfunction (angiopoietin-2) than resolving HRF after adjustment. Only half of persistent HRF patients had ARDS, yet exhibited higher mortality and biomarkers than resolving HRF regardless of whether they qualified for ARDS. CONCLUSION: Patients with persistent HRF are common and have higher mortality and elevated circulating markers of lung injury compared to resolving HRF, and yet only a subset are captured by ARDS definitions. Persistent HRF may represent a clinically important, inclusive target for future therapeutic trials in HRF.

39929,"Psychological stress, immune dysfunction, and allergy: Opportunities for improved patient health",2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND: CMS recently decided to produce private “healthcare disparities reports” that include dual eligibility (DE) as the sole stratifying variable used to assess pneumonia readmission disparities. RESEARCH DESIGN: We measure the relationship between DE status and readmissions, both with and without conceptually relevant social risk factors, including air pollution, severe housing problems, and food insecurity, using data from county- and hospital-level readmission rates, DE status, and social risk factors. RESULTS: At the county level, the relationship between DE status and readmissions is partially confounded by at least three social risk factors. DE populations vary widely across hospitals, creating unequal between-hospital comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Because of differences in the DE population, between-hospital comparisons could be misleading using a methodology that stratifies by DE only. We suggest viable alternatives to sole-factor stratification to properly account for social risk factors and better isolate quality differences that might yield readmission rate inequities. IMPLICATIONS: CMS's healthcare disparities reports provided to hospitals are limited by relying exclusively on DE proportion as the measure of social risk, undercutting the power of quality measurement and its related incentives to close or minimize healthcare inequities.","Alberti, Philip M.; Baker, Matthew C.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505368/,98
41876,Factors associated with phylogenetic clustering of hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Baltimore,2020-11-10,"Since December 2019, the novel COVID-19’s spread rate is exponential, and AI-driven tools are used to prevent further spreading [1]. They can help predict, screen, and diagnose COVID-19 positive cases. Within this scope, imaging with Computed Tomography (CT) scans and Chest X-rays (CXRs) are widely used in mass triage situations. In the literature, AI-driven tools are limited to one data type either CT scan or CXR to detect COVID-19 positive cases. Integrating multiple data types could possibly provide more information in detecting anomaly patterns due to COVID-19. Therefore, in this paper, we engineered a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -tailored Deep Neural Network (DNN) that can collectively train/test both CT scans and CXRs. In our experiments, we achieved an overall accuracy of 96.28% (AUC = 0.9808 and false negative rate = 0.0208). Further, major existing DNNs provided coherent results while integrating CT scans and CXRs to detect COVID-19 positive cases.","Mukherjee, Himadri; Ghosh, Subhankar; Dhar, Ankita; Obaidullah, Sk Md; Santosh, K.

Given the high percentage of aging population, large number of nursing homes, and staggering surge of COVID-19 cases in Florida, it’s critical to understand factors that may affect Florida nursing homes’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Nursing Home COVID-19 Dataset as of July 26, 2020 obtained through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Provider Info Dataset and Health Deficiencies Dataset available through CMS Nursing Home Compare data, we constructed a database of Florida nursing facilities with confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, with corresponding facility characteristics and quality deficiencies. We examined the facility characteristics (e.g. facility size, ownership state, chain affiliation, staffing level) and quality deficiencies (e.g. infection control deficiencies) of Florida nursing homes with and without publicly reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. Results indicated that, as of July 26, 2020, 73.3% and 40.8% of Florida nursing homes had resident COVID-19 cases and death, respectively (N=701). Findings also suggested that Florida nursing homes of large facility size, chain affiliated, and for profit, were significantly more likely to have documented resident COVID-19 cases (p<.05). Larger facility size (120 beds or more), staff shortage, and having prior infection control deficiency citation, were significantly related to the odds of having resident COVID-19 deaths (p<.05). Policy and practice implications and future research directions will be addressed to better protect the at-risk nursing home residents.","Wang, Xiaochuan; Wilson, Courtney",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742140/,98

Clinical Impact of Molecular Point-of-Care Testing for COVID-19 in Adults Presenting to Hospital: A Prospective, Interventional, Non-Randomised, Controlled Study",2020-12-31,"Traditional gender roles that define what is feminine and masculine also imply that men have higher social status than women. These stereotypes still influence how people interact with each other and with computers. Touch behaviour, essential in social interactions, is an interesting example of such social behaviours. The Midas touch effect describes a situation when a brief touch is used to influence one’s behaviour. Our study aimed to analyse the influence of virtual touch on compliance in men in a decision-making game called Ultimatum. In a series of three studies, we investigated whether social cues such as gender, stereotypical masculine/feminine appearance, and high/low social status modify compliance to offers from embodied agents. We built an immersive version of a repeated Ultimatum game in which a proposer offers how to split ten coins, and a responder accepts or rejects the offer. In study 1, men and women played with a female and a male agent. In study 2 and 3, men played with four agents each, differing in gender and levels of stereotypically seen masculinity and social status. There was no significant touch effect. Compliance was secured mostly by the value of the offer: the more generous the offer, the higher the compliance rate. We also found evidence for the perceived masculinity and social status influence. We also describe relationships between agents’ characteristics and the perception of their touch. The results are discussed in the context of social characteristics that are important in agent design and the effectiveness of social influence techniques in virtual reality.

RESULTS: A total of 80 patients (49 males and 31 females, 46.48 ± 16.09 years) confirmed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR and who underwent chest CT scan within 2 weeks of symptoms, and 100 patients (55 males and 45 females, 48.94 ± 18.97 years) presented with GGO on chest CT were enrolled in the study. Three radiologists reviewed all CT chest exams after removal of all identifying data from the images. They expressed the result as positive or negative for COVID-19 and recorded the other pulmonary CT features with mention of laterality, lobar affection, and distribution pattern. The clinical data and laboratory findings were recorded. Chest CT offered diagnostic accuracy ranging from 59 to 77.2% in differentiating COVID-19- from non-COVID-19-associated GGO with sensitivity from 76.25 to 90% and specificity from 45 to 67%. The specificity was lower when differentiating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 viral pneumonias (30.5–61.1%) and higher (53.1–70.3%) after exclusion of viral pneumonia from the non-COVID-19 group. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have lesions in lower lobes (p = 0.005), peripheral distribution (p < 0.001), isolated ground-glass opacity (p = 0.043), subpleural bands (p = 0.048), reverse halo sign (p = 0.005), and vascular thickening (p = 0.013) but less likely to have pulmonary nodules (p < 0.001), traction bronchiectasis (p = 0.005), pleural effusion (p < 0.001), and lymphadenopathy (p < 0.001).

44046,530. COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients: Single-center experience and case-control study,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir (RDV) has been shown to shorten recovery time and was well tolerated in patients with severe COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (HQN) is an experimental treatment for COVID-19. Effects of coadministration of HQN with RDV have not been studied and are relevant given the long half-life (~22 days) of HQN. We report the impact of concomitant HQN and RDV use on clinical outcomes and safety in patients with moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation >94% on room air, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV once daily plus standard of care (SoC), or SoC only. We compared patients on concomitant HQN (HQN(pos)) vs not (HQN(neg)). Clinical recovery was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards. Covariate adjustment included age, sex, race, region, symptom duration, oxygen support status and obesity. Recovery and adverse events (AEs) were assessed through death, discharge, or d14. RESULTS: Of 584 patients, 199 (34%) received HQN (5d RDV: n=57 [30%]; 10d RDV, n=49 [25%]; SoC: n=93 [47%]). Through median follow-up of 13d (range 1-41d), HQN(pos) patients on 5d or 10d RDV had a lower recovery rate (adjusted HR [95% CI] 0.78 [0.59, 1.03], p=0.09) with longer median time to recovery (8 vs 6 days) compared to HQN(neg). HQN(pos) compared to HQN(neg) patients in 5d RDV showed a trend of reduced recovery rate (HR: 0.69 [0.45,1.04], p=0.080); such an effect was not observed in 10d RDV or SoC (Table 1). More HQN(pos) than HQN(neg) patients had AEs in RDV (5/10d) or SoC arms evaluated separately, and all arms combined. This difference was significant for AEs and SAEs for all arms combined after covariate adjustment (Table 2). Table 1. [Image: see text] Table 2. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In moderate COVID-19 patients, concomitant HQN may delay recovery on RDV and showed no impact on recovery with SoC alone. The AE profile of HQN(pos) patients was worse than that observed for HQN(neg) patients, regardless of RDV treatment.

46490,ÓBITOS POR COVID‐19 E LEITOS DE TERAPIA INTENSIVA EQUIPADOS COM RESPIRADORES: UMA ANÁLISE COMPARATIVA ENTRE AS REGIÕES BRASILEIRAS,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the Mount Sinai Health System Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) center reported an increase in telephone call volume, with many IBD patients expressing anxiety about being on immunosuppressive agents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with GI society and CDC recommendations, we leveraged the Rx.Universe platform (Rx.Health, New York, NY) to rapidly design and deliver a population-based digital navigation program (DNP) to provide outreach, remote COVID-19 symptom monitoring, triage, and Telehealth to IBD patients. METHODS: After identifying all IBD patients seen in our IBD center from Electronic Health Records (Epic Systems), we “bulk prescribed” the DNP (Rx.Health, New York NY) to 6100 patients’ smartphones. Patients were asked to reply to the prompt if they had new or worsening COVID-19 symptoms and opted-in to regular digital monitoring through an electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) instrument. Patient data was screened by our clinical coordinators, who directly contacted patients via phone calls and scheduled testing and Telehealth visits with IBD practitioners when appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 6100 patients who were sent the DNP, 1829 patients opted-in to be regularly monitored using text-based electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) instruments. Of those who responded affirmatively, 145 patients were identified requiring additional medical attention and were triaged using Telehealth visits. Compared to patients who chose not to opt-in, patients who opted-in were more likely to be female, white, married, on biologics, and had high inflammatory markers (Table 1). CONCLUSION: As demonstrated by the 30% of patients who opted-in to regular COVID-19 symptom monitoring, a digital navigation program population approach is an effective and efficient approach to provide continuity of care and to mitigate COVID-19 exposure in a high-risk, immunosuppressed IBD population. This scalable approach serves as a model for providing high quality, remote monitoring to patients during COVID-19 and beyond, as well as achieving “Treat to Target” goals.

Aims To describe the role of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) as the sole available non-invasive diagnostic test for symptomatic patients with suspected CAD in a hub center for cardiovascular emergencies in the presence of limited access to hospital facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Results From March 9th to April 30th, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a consecutive cohort of symptomatic patients with high clinical suspicion of CAD and clinical indication to CCTA were enrolled in a hub hospital in Milan, Italy. When obstructive coronary artery disease was detected (>70% diameter stenosis in a proximal coronary segment or >90% stenosis in any coronary segment) patients were referred to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Clinical follow-up was assessed in patients in whom ICA was considered deferrable. Overall, 58 consecutive patients were included. Ten (17.2%) symptomatic patients underwent ICA according to CCTA findings, while in 48 (82.8%) patients ICA was deferred. No clinical events were recorded after a mean follow-up of 49.7 ± 16.8 days. In nine out of ten patients referred to ICA, severe coronary artery disease was confirmed and treated accordingly. Changes in medical therapy were significantly more prevalent in patients with vs. those without CAD at CCTA. CONCLUSION: We report a potential pivotal role for CCTA in the triage of non-COVID-19 patients with suspected CAD during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. CCTA may be helpful for identifying patients who necessitate ICA, ensuring adequate resource utilization during the pandemic.","Conte, E; Mushtaq, S; Mancini, M; Annoni, A; Formenti, A; Muscogiuri, G; Baggiano, A; Guglielmo, M; Guadenzi-Asinelli, M; Gigante, C; Assanelli, E; Pontone, G; Pepi, M; Andreini, D",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928997/,98

57735,Early Use of Remdesivir: A Good Start,2021-09-09,"INTRODUCTION: Total body irradiation is an effective conditioning regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in pediatric and adult patients with high risk or relapsed/refractory leukemia. The most common adverse effect is pulmonary toxicity including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). As centers adopt more advanced treatment planning techniques for TBI, total marrow irradiation (TMI), or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) there is a greater need to understand treatment-related risks for IPS for patients treated with conventional TBI. However, definitions of IPS as well as risk factors for IPS remain poorly characterized. In this study, we perform a critical review to further evaluate the literature describing pulmonary outcomes after TBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of publications from 1960-2020 was undertaken in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Search terms included “total body irradiation”, “whole body radiation”, “radiation pneumonias”, “interstitial pneumonia”, and “bone marrow transplantation”. Demographic and treatment-related data was abstracted and evidence quality supporting risk factors for pulmonary toxicity was evaluated. RESULTS: Of an initial 119,686 publications, 118 met inclusion criteria. Forty-six (39%) studies included a definition for pulmonary toxicity. A grading scale was provided in 20 studies (17%). In 42% of studies the lungs were shielded to a set mean dose of 800cGy. Fourteen (12%) reported toxicity outcomes by patient age. Reported pulmonary toxicity ranged from 0-71% of patients treated with TBI, and IPS ranged from 1-60%. The most common risk factors for IPS were receipt of a TBI containing regimen, increasing dose rate, and lack of pulmonary shielding. Four studies found an increasing risk of pulmonary toxicity with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Definitions of IPS as well as demographic and treatment-related risk factors remain poorly characterized in the literature. We recommend routine adoption of the diagnostic workup and the definition of IPS proposed by the American Thoracic Society. Additional study is required to determine differences in clinical and treatment-related risk between pediatric and adult patients. Further study using 3D treatment planning is warranted to enhance dosimetric precision and correlation of dose volume histograms with toxicities.","Vogel, Jennifer; Hui, Susanta; Hua, Chia-Ho; Dusenbery, Kathryn; Rassiah, Premavarthy; Kalapurakal, John; Constine, Louis; Esiashvili, Natia",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8428368/,98
59263,Nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury following CoronaVac anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,2021-08-28,"Background: Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for bronchoalveolar epithelial cell (BAEC) injury. Understanding the relevant pathogenesis is important for the treatment of cigarette smoke–related chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: In this study, BAECs were cultured in 5% cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or regular culture medium for 24 h. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analysis was performed on DEGs. Co-treated BAECs with 5% CSE and the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin-1 was applied to observe the role of ferroptosis. Results: In the CSE group, 210 upregulated genes and 159 downregulated genes were identified compared with the control group. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that the DEGs were related to oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis-related genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. The mRNA level of GPX4 decreased; the mRNA levels of ACSL4, FTH1 and SLC7A11 increased (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 mitigated CSE-induced ROS accumulation and inflammatory mediator expression in BAECs (p < 0.05). Conclusion: CSE treatment altered ferroptosis-related gene expression patterns in cultured BAECs. Inhibition of ferroptosis reduced the inflammatory response of CSE-treated BAECs. These data provide a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of CSE-related lung injury.","Lian, Ningfang; Zhang, Qiaoxian; Chen, Jia; Chen, Mengxue; Huang, Jiefeng; Lin, Qichang",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511776/,98

61068,Covid-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients: endocrine and metabolic issues.,2020-05-15,"The study of complex networks with multiweights (CNMWs) has been a hot topic recently. For a network with a single weight, previous studies have shown that they can promote synchronization, but for CNMWs, there are no rigorous analyses about the role of coupling matrices. In this brief, the complex network is allowed to be directed, which is the main difference with previous studies and may make the synchronization analysis difficult for multiple couplings. At first, we prove that if the inner coupling matrices are all diagonal, then synchronization can be realized only if the weighted sum (or union) of multiple coupling matrices is strongly connected, which bridges the gap between single-weighted and multiweighted networks. Moreover, we also consider the case that inner coupling matrices are positive definite but not diagonal. We design two techniques for this hard problem. One technique is to decompose inner coupling matrices into diagonal matrices and residual matrices. The other one is to measure the similarity between outer coupling matrices. In virtue of the normalized left eigenvectors (NLEVecs) corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of coupling matrices, we prove that if the Chebyshev distance between NLEVec is less than some value, defined as the allowable deviation bound, then the synchronization and control will be realized with sufficiently large coupling strengths. Furthermore, adaptive rules are also designed for coupling strength.","Liu, Xiwei",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3110681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520375/,98

63046,Graves'-induced prothrombotic state and the risk of early-onset myocardial infarction.,2021-06-11,"Objective Microwave ablation (MWA) of liver malignancies has gained much traction over the past 5 years. However, MWA carries relatively higher rates of residual disease compared to resection. Likelihood of MWA success is multifactorial and newer devices with more reliable ablation zones are being developed to overcome these drawbacks. This manuscript is a review of our first 100 liver ablations with the newer single antenna high powered MWA system. Materials and Methods Retrospective chart review of patients that underwent MWA for either primary or secondary hepatic malignancies between March 2015 and July 2016 was conducted. The complete ablation rates, rate of new lesions, complications, and short-term survival were analyzed. Multiple statistical tests, including multivariate regression, were used to assess risk factors for local residual and recurrent disease. Results Fifty-three patients (median age 61 ± 9 years, 39 males) underwent 100 MWAs. Of the 100 lesions ablated, 76 were hepatocellular cancers (HCCs) and 24 were metastases. Median lesion size was 16 ± 9 mm. Seventy- five of these patients had multifocal disease targeted in the same session. Seventy patients had cirrhosis (median model for end-stage liver disease score 9 ± 3; Child-Pugh B and C in 42%). An 83% complete lesion ablation rate was seen on follow-up imaging with liver protocol magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (median follow-up of 1 year). The minor complication rate was 9.4% with no major complications or 30-day mortality. Despite this, evidence of new foci of hepatic disease was found in 47% of patients, the majority (80%) of which were in HCC patients (P < 0.01) and most of these new lesions were in a different hepatic segment (64%). Degree of cirrhosis (P < 0.01), presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (P = 0.01) and lesion's subcapsular location (P = 0.03) was significant predictors of residual disease.

64012,Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage secondary to haemophilus influenzae in a vaping patient.,2021-06-15,"OBJECTIVES The use of staplers for thoracic surgery has been widely accepted and regarded as a safe procedure. However, adverse events (AEs) of stapling are occasionally experienced. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the AEs of stapling in pulmonary vascular surgery. METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the 29 institutions of the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group. All staplings of the pulmonary artery (PA) and vein in thoracic surgery were reviewed during the research period. RESULTS Stapling of the PA and vein was performed 3393 times. The total number of AEs related to stapling was nine (0.27%). Eight events occurred intraoperatively and one occurred immediately after the operation. Intraoperative AE occurred more frequently than postoperative AE. AE in the PA occurred more frequently than in the pulmonary vein. The intraoperative AEs were oozing (n=3), stapling failure (n=2), laceration of the peripheral vasculature at compression (n=2) and technical injury of the vasculature at insertion (n=1). The causes of AEs were reported to be tissue fragility (n=3), stapler rocking during stapling (n=2), stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (n=2) and technical failure (n=1). The only postoperative AE was staple line rupture of the PV stump. No relationship was seen between the incidence of AE and cartridge colours, compression types of staplers or numbers of staple lines. CONCLUSIONS Generally, stapling of the pulmonary vasculatures in recent thoracic surgery has been safe. Furthermore, the knowledge of the possible risks of pulmonary vascular stapling may help to decrease the AEs of stapling.","Yano, Motoki; Takao, Motoshi; Fujinaga, Takuji; Arimura, Takaaki; Fukai, Ichiro; Ota, Shinichiro; Saito, Yushi; Okuda, Katsuhiro",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivt130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23633560/,98

Therefore, preserving the structural stability of GBCAs to reduce their propensity to liberate Gd3+ is of utmost importance. This study evaluates the effect of gadolinium concentration of GBCAs on solution temperature under magnetic fields. It is hypothesized that presence of gadolinium will lead to temperature changes of its solutions under magnetic field, and this change will depend on concentration. In this study, GBCAs were diluted to concentrations of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 mMol/L. A 10mL preparation in pure water, simulated body fluid (SBF), and plasma was scanned at 3T following a soft tissue neck protocol, and their temperatures were measured. Findings revealed that concentration of GBCA had significant effect on temperature change in all dilution media. Type of commercially available GBCA had an effect only in SFB and plasma. Evaluation of correlation between conditional stability constant (Kcond) and temperature difference (ΔT) revealed that in water and SBF there exists a positive correlation between Kcond and temperature variation. Collectively, GBCAs can cause local temperature variations when administered into patients, and can affect dissociation of gadolinium from its chelates, which should be investigated in a further study.","Arda, Kemal; Akay, Sinan; Erisken, Cevat",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947239/,98

Ever since the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the second world war of (1939-1945), the world has not been faced with a common problem in recent memory like the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with a viral pathogen, the nascent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is characterized by respiratory failure in severe cases. The communicability period of COVID-19 varies, but it is usually between 2-14 days, and the major signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are high temperature (fever), severe and consistent cough, and serious breathing problems in severe cases, however, complications result in the serious inflammation of the lungs, and organ malfunction occurs in patients with comorbidities and health conditions especially diabetes, heart disease and obesity. With high virulence and contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, over 11.4 million confirmed cases and over 533,780 deaths have occurred as a result of COVID-19 globally, with over 6.1 million recoveries as of 6th July 2020. Presently, there is no known cure for COVID-19, however, remdesivir has been approved for emergency use for the treatment of COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration, a United States federal regulatory body (FDA), while various clinical trial treatments and vaccines are being tried globally. The world is faced with containing the spread of the infection, and this review revealed that thorough hand washing with antiseptic soap and running water and usage of alcohol hand sanitizer, frequent surfaces cleaning, strict adherence to social distancing, regular respiratory hygiene, wearing of protective face masks, frequent testing, self-isolation, quarantine and rigorous contact tracing will help to prevent further spread, and control the transmission of the viral pathogen. It is however strongly recommended that only the strict compliance to the mitigative and preventive measures provided above will yield the desired results in the prevention, management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayenigbara, Israel Oluwasegun; Adeleke, Olasunkanmi Rowland; Ayenigbara, George Omoniyi; Adegboro, Joseph Sunday; Olofintuyi, Oluwaseyi Oye",Germs,https://doi.org/10.18683/germs.2020.1208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134200/,98

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32480230/,98

Despite the effectively demonstrated repurposed drugs, more repurposed drugs should be recognized. Furthermore, technological advancements have been helpful in the battle against COVID-19. Machine intelligence technology can support this procedure by rapidly determining adequate and effective drugs against COVID-19 and by overcoming any barrier between a large number of repurposed drugs, laboratory/clinical testing, and final drug authorization.

70808,Failure to obtain microbiological culture and its consequence in a mesh-related infection.,2013,"PURPOSE In response to the challenges of an aging population and decreasing workforce, the provision of critical care services has been a target for quality and efficiency improvement efforts. Reliable data on available critical care resources is a necessary first step in informing these efforts. We sought to describe the availability of critical care resources, forecast the future requirement for the highest-level critical care beds and to determine the physician management models in critical care units in Ontario, Canada. METHODS In June 2006, self-administered questionnaires were mailed to the Chief Executive Officers of all acute care hospitals, identified through the Ontario government's hospital database. The questionnaire solicited information on the number and type of critical care units, number of beds, technological resources and management of each unit. RESULTS Responses were obtained from 174 (100%) hospitals, with 126 (73%) reporting one or more critical care units. We identified 213 critical care units in the province, representing 1789 critical care beds. Over half (59%) of these beds provided mechanical ventilation on a regular basis, representing a capacity of 14.9 critical care and 8.7 mechanically ventilated beds per 100,000 population. Sixty-three percent of units with capacity for mechanical ventilation involved an intensivist in admission and coordination of care. Based on current utilization, the demand for mechanically ventilated beds by 2026 is forecast to increase by 57% over levels available in 2006. Assuming 80% bed utilization, it is estimated that an additional 810 ventilated beds will be needed by 2026. CONCLUSION Current utilization suggests a substantial increase in the need for the highest-level critical care beds over the next two decades. Our findings also indicate that non-intensivists direct care decisions in a large number of responding units. Unless major investments are made, significant improvements in efficiency will be required to maintain future access to these services.","Hill, Andrea D; Fan, Eddy; Stewart, Thomas E; Sibbald, William J; Nauenberg, Eric; Lawless, Bernard; Bennett, Jocelyn; Martin, Claudio M",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-009-9055-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19296190/,98

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to determine changes in CSF levels of neuronal and glial biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain (NFL), total tau (t-tau), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and S100B in various groups of MS (MS versus controls, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) versus controls, CIS versus MS, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) versus progressive MS (PMS), and MS in relapse versus remission. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, we included 64 articles in the meta-analysis, including 4071 subjects. For investigation of sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Meta-analyses were performed for comparisons including at least three individual datasets. NFL, GFAP, t-tau, CHI3L1, and S100B were higher in MS and NFL, t-tau, and CHI3L1 were also elevated in CIS patients than controls. CHI3L1 was the only marker with higher levels in MS than CIS. GFAP levels were higher in PMS versus RRMS, and NFL, t-tau, and CHI3L1 did not differ between different subtypes. Only levels of NFL were higher in patients in relapse than remission. Meta-regression showed influence of sex and disease severity on NFL and t-tau levels, respectively and disease duration on both. Added to the role of these biomarkers in determining prognosis and treatment response, to conclude, they may serve in diagnosis of MS and distinguishing different subtypes.","Momtazmanesh, Sara; Shobeiri, Parnian; Saghazadeh, Amene; Teunissen, Charlotte E; Burman, Joachim; Szalardy, Levente; Klivenyi, Peter; Bartos, Ales; Fernandes, Adelaide; Rezaei, Nima",Reviews in the neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2020-0145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594840/,98
75557,"Simultaneous acute myocardial infarction, stroke and critical limb ischaemia: an unusual presentation requiring multidisciplinary approach.",2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND The extent to which very young children contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France. METHODS Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968. FINDINGS Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1·9 [SD 0·9] years; range 5 months to 4·4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4·3%; 95% CI 2·6-7·1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7·7%; 4·2-11·6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3·7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1·3-6·8) of the children and 6·8% (3·2-11·5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5·5%; 95% CI 2·9-10·1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5·0% (95% CrI 1·6-9·8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7·1 [95% CI 2·2-22·4]). INTERPRETATION According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this exploratory hypothesis.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the levels of perceived quality of life in patients operated on for breast cancer in relation to the type of surgery, using the standardized questionnaires. Materials and Methods: We assessed 425 women after surgery for breast cancer. The assessment included the application of the WHOQOL-bref (The World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref), and FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast) questionnaires. The statistical analysis of the data included multiple linear regression and correlation tests. Results: Multiple linear regression analysis found that education, existence of comorbidities, time elapsed since surgery, and type of surgery were significant predictors of overall quality of life. Women's overall quality of life and general health has increased by 0.16 times for each subsequent year of surgery, and by 0.34 times for each subsequent higher education level. Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with breast reconstruction were statistically significant (β = 0.18) compared to total mastectomy. Conclusions: There is a significant difference in the quality of life perceived by patients in whom the breast has been preserved or reconstructed in relation to patients in whom total mastectomy has been performed.","Kovačević, Predrag; Miljković, Snežana; Višnjić, Aleksandar; Kozarski, Jefta; Janković, Radmilo",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56080402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796629/,98

Although its psychometric properties have been extensively studied, one critical piece of information that is missing from the literature is evidence of its longitudinal factorial invariance-that is, whether the RAS measures the same recovery construct across time. The authors empirically tested the longitudinal factorial invariance assumption for the RAS. METHODS Structural equation modeling was used to test the longitudinal factorial invariance of the RAS with data longitudinally obtained at three time points from 167 people with severe mental illness. RESULTS The longitudinal factorial invariance assumption was supported (i.e., configural, metric, partial scalar, factor variance and covariance invariance). CONCLUSIONS This study found empirical evidence that the RAS can measure the same recovery construct over time and thus meets one of the important prerequisites for longitudinal assessment.","Fukui, Sadaaki; Salyers, Michelle P",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730883/,98

MATERIALS AND METHODS We investigated the renal kinetics of a nonionic, dimeric CA (iodixanol) formulated in 3 different osmolalities (hypo-osmolar, iso-osmolar, low-osmolar) and compared it to nonionic, low-osmolar (iopromide), and ionic, low-osmolar CAs (ioxaglate) using computed tomography for a period of 24 hours. The CAs were administered intravenously at a dosage of 4 g iodine/kg body weight. The average exposure was calculated, and urine viscosities were compared before the injection and during the time intervals of 0 to 60 minutes and 60 to 120 minutes after the injection. Renal oxygenation levels of the renal cortex and medulla were estimated using blood-oxygen-level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging. We used histologic methods to systematically analyze the gravity of vacuole formation based on the physicochemical and substance-specific properties of each CA. RESULTS Iso-osmolar and hypo-osmolar iodixanol and, to a lesser extent, iodixanol/mannitol accumulated rapidly in the kidneys during the first 5 minutes of the injection and remained higher 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after the injection compared with iopromide and ioxaglate, which showed fast iodine excretion. Similarly, lower renal blood oxygen levels were estimated for all iodixanol formulations as compared with ioxaglate and iopromide. The incidence of vacuole formation was high for all iodixanol formulations and for ioxaglate (6 of 6 rats) and low for iopromide (1 of 6 rats). Moderate severity of vacuoles was determined for the iodixanol solutions; minimal severity, for ioxaglate and iopromide. CONCLUSIONS We identified a superior profile for the low-osmolar CAs compared with the iso-osmolar CAs regarding rapid excretion, short-term renal exposure, and renal oxygenation.","Lenhard, Diana Constanze; Frisk, Anna-Lena; Lengsfeld, Philipp; Pietsch, Hubertus; Jost, Gregor",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0b013e31827b70f9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23262792/,98

Their epidemiologies and clinical characteristics are poorly described and are often reliant on case reports. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale comprehensive screening for all four coronaviruses by analysis of 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, over 3 years between July 2006 and June 2009 using a novel four-way multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Coronaviruses were detected in 0.3 to 0.85% of samples in all age groups. Generally, coronaviruses displayed marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and were not detected in summer months, which is comparable to the pattern seen with influenza viruses. HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year. There were additional longer-term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV-OC43 predominant in the first and third seasons and HCoV-HKU1 dominating in the second (see Results for definitions of seasons). A total of 11 to 41% of coronaviruses detected were in samples testing positive for other respiratory viruses, although clinical presentations of coronavirus monoinfections were comparable to those of viruses which have an established role in respiratory disease, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses. The novel multiplex assay for real-time pan-coronavirus detection enhances respiratory virus diagnosis, overcomes potential diagnostic problems arising through seasonal variation in coronavirus frequency, and provides novel insights into the epidemiology and clinical implications of coronaviruses.","Gaunt, E R; Hardie, A; Claas, E C J; Simmonds, P; Templeton, K E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00636-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554810/,98

86530,Operative Positioning Technique for an Intertrochanteric Fracture in a Patient with an Ipsilateral Below-the-Knee Amputation: A Case Report.,2019,"BACKGROUND Whether total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) is associated with worse outcomes compared to transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) for the treatment of recurrent inguinal hernia continues to be a matter of debate. The objective of this large cohort study is to compare complications, conversion rates and postoperative length of hospital stay between patients undergoing TEP or TAPP for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia repair. METHOD Based on prospective data of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery, all patients who underwent elective TEP or TAPP for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia between 1995 and 2006 were included. The following outcomes were compared: conversion rates, intraoperative complications, surgical postoperative complications and duration of operation. RESULTS Data on 1309 patients undergoing TEP (n = 1022) and TAPP (n = 287) for recurrent inguinal hernia were prospectively collected. Average age, BMI and ASA score were similar in both groups. Patients undergoing TEP had a significantly increased rate of intraoperative complications (TEP 6.3 % vs. TAPP 2.8 %, p = 0.0225). Duration of operation was longer for patients undergoing TEP (TEP 80.3 vs. TAPP 73.0 min, p < 0.0023) while postoperative length of hospital stay was longer for patients undergoing TAPP (TEP 2.6 vs. TAPP 3.1 day, p = 0.0145). Surgical postoperative complications (TEP 3.52 % vs. TAPP 2.09 %, p = 0.2239), general postoperative complications (TEP 1.47 % vs. TAPP 0.7 %, p = 0.3081) and conversion rates (TEP 2.15 % vs. TAPP 1.39 %, p = 0.4155) were not significantly different. CONCLUSION This study is the first population-based analysis comparing outcomes of patients with recurrent inguinal hernia undergoing TEP versus TAPP in a prospective cohort of over 1300 patients. Intraoperative complications were significantly higher in patients undergoing TEP. The TEP technique was associated with longer operating times, but a shorter postoperative length of hospital stay. Nonetheless, the absolute outcome differences are small and thus, on a population-based level, both techniques appear to be safe and effective for patients undergoing endoscopic repair for unilateral recurrent inguinal hernia.","Gass, M; Scheiwiller, A; Sykora, M; Metzger, J",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3545-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27150604/,98

We collected reporting incidence data on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in China from 2004 to 2014. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was performed to accurately describe the reporting incidence trends of HBV and HCV. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change in incidence across provinces and age groups. Nationwide, a total of 916 426 hepatitis B cases and 39 381 hepatitis C cases were recorded in 2004; the reporting incidences of HBV and HCV were 70.50/100 000 and 3.03/100 000, respectively. The overall relative changes in HBV and HCV reporting incidences in China from 2004 to 2014 were 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00, P = .082) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.12-1.20, P < .001), respectively. Thirteen provinces experienced decline in HBV reporting incidence. Most provinces exhibited an increasing trend in HCV reporting incidence. People aged ≤24 displayed a significant descending trend in HBV reporting incidence; people aged ≥55 exhibited a significant increasing trend. For HCV infection, the reporting incidence increased in all age groups except the 10-14 age group. In China, the majority of provinces have experienced decline or remained stable in HBV infection but show significant increases in HCV infection. Children and adolescents are well protected from HBV infection, while relatively higher increasing rates are found among older people. HCV is much more prevalent among older people, although its emergence has shifted to younger age groups.","Liu, Z; Yang, Q; Shi, O; Ye, W; Chen, X; Zhang, T",Journal of viral hepatitis,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.12938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851287/,98

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records. RESULTS Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female. At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home. INTERPRETATION In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies. These data suggest that the prognosis associated with critical illness due to COVID-19 may not be as poor as previously reported.","Mitra, Anish R; Fergusson, Nicholas A; Lloyd-Smith, Elisa; Wormsbecker, Andrew; Foster, Denise; Karpov, Andrei; Crowe, Sarah; Haljan, Greg; Chittock, Dean R; Kanji, Hussein D; Sekhon, Mypinder S; Griesdale, Donald E G",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461326/,98
90301,EULAR provisional recommendations for the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the context of SARS-CoV-2.,2020-06-05,"Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically, facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity. Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling methods.","Xie, Wanqing; Liang, Lizhong; Lu, Yao; Wang, Chen; Shen, Jihong; Luo, Hui; Liu, Xiaofeng",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3092628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170837/,98

93642,Greetings from the editor 2021.,2021-01-01,"The objective of our study is to develop extended finite element method models of cancellous bone specimens that are capable of accurately predicting the onset and propagation of cracks under mechanical loading. In order to do so, previously published three-point bending test results of a single trabecula were replicated using two different extended finite element method approaches, namely, elastic-plastic-fracture and elastic-fracture that considered different configurations of the elasto-plastic properties of bone from which the best approach to fit the experimental data was identified. The behavior of a single trabecula was then used in 2D extended finite element method models to quantify the strength of the trabecular tissue of the forearm along three perpendicular anatomical axes. The results revealed that the elastic-plastic-fracture model better represented the experimental data in the model of a single trabecula. Considering the 2D trabecular specimens, the elastic fracture model predicted higher strength than the elastic-plastic-fracture model and there was no difference in stiffness between the two models. In general, the specimens exhibited higher failure strain and more ductile behavior in compression than in tension. In addition, strength and stiffness were found to be higher in tension than compression on average. It can be concluded that with proper parameters, extended finite element method is capable of simulating the ductile behavior of cancellous bone. The models are able to quantify the tensile strength of trabecular tissue in the various anatomical directions reporting an increased strength in the longitudinal direction of forearm cancellous bone tissue. Extended finite element method of cancellous bone proves to be a valuable tool to predict the mechanical characteristics of cancellous bones as a function of the microstructure.","Salem, Mohammad; Westover, Lindsey; Adeeb, Samer; Duke, Kajsa","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Stressors from the pandemic are likely to be experienced in many ways by older adults with heterogeneous life experiences and supports available. In this context, it is necessary to tease out the underlying mechanisms leading to positive and negative well-being and mental health across interdependent individual, social and environmental factors. The aim of the present study is to explore community-dwelling older adults' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on mental health and psychosocial well-being. Methods: An exploratory longitudinal qualitative study will be conducted with data collected through written submissions, narrative interviews and go-along interviews with older adults living in Irish community settings. To enable the exploration of participants' responses to the evolving social, economic and environmental circumstances, data collection will take during the implementation of public health restrictions and once these are eased and the vaccination program is rolled out. Framework analysis will be carried out to identify data themes, linkages, and explanations within Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological model.

Suicidal ideation happens prior to the actual suicidal behaviour; thus, identifying the roots of suicidal ideation is vital. This study investigated the relationships between parental closeness, self-efficacy and suicidal ideation among adolescents in Malaysia. The mediation effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation was also examined. METHOD A total of 684 school-going adolescents aged 14-17 years old were recruited via multistage cluster sampling. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's correlation analysis. The mediation model was tested using SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes. RESULTS The results showed that mother closeness, father closeness and self-efficacy had significant negative correlation with suicidal ideation. Specifically, self-efficacy emerged as a partial mediator in the relation between mother closeness and suicidal ideation. Self-efficacy also fully mediated the relationship between father closeness and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS The findings implied that mother closeness had stronger correlation with adolescents' suicidal ideation compared to father closeness, while self-efficacy plays an important role in the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation. Prevention and intervention efforts by practitioners dealing with adolescents' mental health issues, specifically on suicidal ideation, should seriously consider providing them with skills to enhance mother-adolescent relationship and their self-efficacy.","Wu, Shin Ling; Yaacob, Siti Nor",Child and adolescent mental health,https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680320/,98

They constitute abrupt increases of intracranial pressure (ICP) above 40 mmHg associated with a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The aim of this study was to describe plateau waves characteristics with multimodal brain monitoring in head injured patients admitted in neurocritical care. METHODS Prospective observational study in 18 multiple trauma patients with head injury admitted to Neurocritical Care Unit of Hospital Sao Joao in Porto. Multimodal systemic and brain monitoring of primary variables [heart rate, arterial blood pressure, ICP, CPP, pulse amplitude, end tidal CO₂, brain temperature, brain tissue oxygenation pressure, cerebral oximetry (CO) with transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow (CBF)] and secondary variables related to cerebral compensatory reserve and cerebrovascular reactivity were supported by dedicated software ICM+ ( www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icmplus) . The compiled data were analyzed in patients who developed plateau waves. RESULTS In this study we identified 59 plateau waves that occurred in 44% of the patients (8/18). During plateau waves CBF, cerebrovascular resistance, CO, and brain tissue oxygenation decreased. The duration and magnitude of plateau waves were greater in patients with working cerebrovascular reactivity. After the end of plateau wave, a hyperemic response was recorded in 64% of cases with increase in CBF and brain oxygenation. The magnitude of hyperemia was associated with better autoregulation status and low oxygenation levels at baseline. CONCLUSIONS Multimodal brain monitoring facilitates identification and understanding of intrinsic vascular brain phenomenon, such as plateau waves, and may help the adequate management of acute head injury at bed side.","Dias, Celeste; Maia, Isabel; Cerejo, António; Varsos, Georgios; Smielewski, Peter; Paiva, José-Artur; Czosnyka, Marek",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-013-9918-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24072460/,98

In several countries, the COVID-19 evolution was relatively benign compared to other and despite non-compliance with health recommendations on several occasions. In this overview, we attempt to define the criteria that could explain such difference. Among these criteria, the specificity of Lactobacillus genus strains, as a part of nasal microbiota, could play a role of barrier against viral penetration and could strengthen the host's immune system in some population rather than others. In fact, several studies have shown the role of lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli, in the prevention of viral respiratory infections.

104009,Generalised urticaria following ingestion of a nickel-plated coin in a 4-year-old girl.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients require mechanical ventilation (MV) for breathing support. Patient-specific PEEP is encouraged for treating different patients but there is no well established method in optimal PEEP selection. METHODS A study of 10 patients diagnosed with ALI/ARDS whom underwent recruitment manoeuvre is carried out. Airway pressure and flow data are used to identify patient-specific constant lung elastance (E lung) and time-variant dynamic lung elastance (E drs) at each PEEP level (increments of 5 cm H2O), for a single compartment linear lung model using integral-based methods. Optimal PEEP is estimated using E lung versus PEEP, Edrs-Pressure curve and E drs Area at minimum elastance (maximum compliance) and the inflection of the curves (diminishing return). Results are compared to clinically selected PEEP values. The trials and use of the data were approved by the New Zealand South Island Regional Ethics Committee. RESULTS Median absolute percentage fitting error to the data when estimating time-variant E drs is 0.9% (IQR = 0.5-2.4) and 5.6% [IQR: 1.8-11.3] when estimating constant E lung. Both E lung and E drs decrease with PEEP to a minimum, before rising, and indicating potential over-inflation. Median E drs over all patients across all PEEP values was 32.2 cmH2O/l [IQR: 26.1-46.6], reflecting the heterogeneity of ALI/ARDS patients, and their response to PEEP, that complicates standard approaches to PEEP selection. All E drs-Pressure curves have a clear inflection point before minimum E drs, making PEEP selection straightforward. Model-based selected PEEP using the proposed metrics were higher than clinically selected values in 7/10 cases. CONCLUSION Continuous monitoring of the patient-specific E lung and E drs and minimally invasive PEEP titration provide a unique, patient-specific and physiologically relevant metric to optimize PEEP selection with minimal disruption of MV therapy.","Chiew, Yeong Shiong; Chase, J Geoffrey; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Sundaresan, Ashwath; Desaive, Thomas",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-925x-10-111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22196749/,98
104974,Casirivimab-Imdevimab for Treatment of COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: an Early Experience.,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND Criteria for transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) are well-defined for Dentsleeve manometry. As high-resolution manometry (HRM) is now the gold standard to assess esophageal motility, our aim was to propose a consensus definition of TLESRs using HRM. METHODS Postprandial esophageal HRM combined with impedance was performed in 10 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations identification was performed by 17 experts using a Delphi process. Four investigators then characterized TLESR candidates that achieved 100% agreement (TLESR events) and those that achieved less than 25% agreement (non-events) after the third round. Logistic regression and decision tree analysis were used to define optimal diagnostic criteria. KEY RESULTS All diagnostic criteria were more frequently encountered in the 57 TLESR events than in the 52 non-events. Crural diaphragm (CD) inhibition and LES relaxation duration >10 seconds had the highest predictive value to identify TLESR. Based on decision tree analysis, reflux on impedance, esophageal shortening, common cavity, upper esophageal sphincter relaxation without swallow and secondary peristalsis were alternate diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSION & INFERENCES Using HRM, TLESR might be defined as LES relaxation occurring in absence of swallowing, lasting more than 10 seconds and associated with CD inhibition.","Roman, S; Holloway, R; Keller, J; Herbella, F; Zerbib, F; Xiao, Y; Bernard, L; Bredenoord, A J; Bruley des Varannes, S; Chen, M; Fox, M; Kahrilas, P J; Mittal, R K; Penagini, R; Savarino, E; Sifrim, D; Wu, J; Decullier, E; Pandolfino, J E; Mion, F",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477826/,98

AIM To prospectively monitor efficacy and serum concentrations of ustekinumab given to children with UC refractory to other biologics. METHODS Children with anti-TNF refractory UC initiating ustekinumab intravenously at sites of the Canadian Children IBD Network prior to 12/2019 are included. The primary endpoint was steroid-free clinical remission with subcutaneous ustekinumab at 52 weeks (Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index <10, no steroids ≥4 weeks). Ustekinumab levels were measured after week 20. Endoscopic improvement was defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1, or faecal calprotectin (FCP) <250 μg/g if not re-colonoscoped. RESULTS At six sites between 01/2018 and 11/2019, 25 children (median [IQR] age 14.8 years [12.3-16.2], 72% female) with UC duration 2.3 years (1.1-4.2) received intravenous ustekinumab (median dose/kg of 6.4 [5.5-7.5] mg). All patients had failed prior infliximab therapy, and 12 (48%) also vedolizumab. Five patients discontinued ustekinumab after IV induction (four undergoing colectomy). On intent to treat basis, 44% achieved the primary endpoint of steroid-free remission at week 52, including nine (69%) of 13 who previously treated with anti-TNF only vs two (17%) of 12 who previously failed also by vedolizumab (P = 0.008). Seven of 11 remitters met the criteria for endoscopic improvement. The median (IQR) trough levels (μg/mL) were greater with q4 vs q8 weekly dosing (8.7 [4.6-9.9] vs 3.8 [12.7-4.8]) P = 0.02, but greater exposure was not associated with a superior rate of clinical remission. No adverse events were associated with therapy. CONCLUSION Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy in this paediatric cohort with otherwise treatment-refractory UC. Treatment failure was not due to inadequate drug exposure.","Dhaliwal, Jasbir; McKay, Hayley E; Deslandres, Colette; Debruyn, Jennifer; Wine, Eytan; Wu, Ashley; Huynh, Hien; Carman, Nicholas; Crowley, Eileen; Church, Peter C; Walters, Thomas D; Ricciuto, Amanda; Griffiths, Anne M",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909911/,98

DESIGN A mixed methods approach was used. Usability testing assessed the appropriateness, potential for errors, and ease of use of various combinations of PPE. A qualitative constructivist approach was used to analyze participant feedback. SETTING Four academic health sciences centers: 2 adult hospitals, 1 trauma center, and 1 pediatric hospital, in Toronto, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Participants (n=82) were representative of the potential users of PPE within Western healthcare institutions. RESULTS None of the tested combinations provided a complete solution for PPE. Environmental factors, such as anteroom layout, and the design of protocols and instructional material were also found to impact safety. The study identified the need to design PPE as a complete system, rather than mixing and matching components. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare institutions are encouraged to use human factors methods to identify risk and failure points with the usage of their selected PPE, and to modify on the basis of iterative evaluations with representative end users.

Here, we applied a dual-channel spray-assisted nanocoating hybrid of shellac/copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) to a nonwoven surgical mask, thereby increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface and repelling aqueous droplets. The resulting surface showed outstanding photoactivity (combined photocatalytic and photothermal properties) for antimicrobial action, conferring reusability and self-sterilizing ability to the masks. Under solar illumination, the temperature of this photoactive antiviral mask (PAM) rapidly increased to >70 °C, generating a high level of free radicals that disrupted the membrane of nanosized (∼100 nm) virus-like particles and made the masks self-cleaning and reusable. This PAM design can provide significant protection against the transmission of viral aerosols in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kumar, Sumit; Karmacharya, Mamata; Joshi, Shalik Ram; Gulenko, Oleksandra; Park, Juhee; Kim, Gun-Ho; Cho, Yoon-Kyoung",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227203/,98
112033,Radiation retinopathy in a case of acute lymphocytic leukaemia.,2020-09-07,"OBJECTIVE During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of visits to healthcare institutions. This circumstance influenced the timely diagnosis and subsequential initiation of therapy in almost all specialties. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a hypothetical change in health awareness with regard to outpatient consultations of ENT physicians in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study used anonymized data from 146 ENT practices in Germany and included 162,724 patients in Q2 2019, 158,077 in Q3 2019, 128,342 in Q2 2020, and 149,153 in Q3 2020. The first outcome was the difference in the number of patients with at least one visit to these practices between the second and third quarters of 2019 and the second and third quarters of 2020. The second outcome was the number of patients with new diagnoses per practice, defined as diagnoses not previously documented in the database for a given patient. RESULTS The number of patients per practice was significantly lower in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019 (879 versus 1108, p<0.001). There were no significant differences when comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019 (1022 versus 1083, p=0.261). Diagnoses of otitis media (-43%), acute upper respiratory tract infections (-42%), chronic upper respiratory tract diseases: (-21%), hearing loss (-20%) decreased significantly in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019. There was still a significant decrease in patient numbers for acute upper respiratory tract infections (-26%) and otitis media (-25%) in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019. CONCLUSIONS The presented results are attributable to several facts. Avoidance of doctor´s visits by the patients, reduction of allocation of appointments by practices and consistent obeying of distance and hygiene measures in terms of wearing filtering face masks (e.g. FFP2/KN95).","Rohe, Anna M; Kostev, Karel; Sesterhenn, Andreas M",Laryngo- rhino- otologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1510-9686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130328/,98

Data on the differences in clinical characteristics between patients with Exon20ins and major mutations (M-mut) such as exon 19 deletion and L858R are limited. We retrospectively reviewed advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, who were treated with systemic therapy between January 2011 and December 2019. We identified 23 patients with Exon20ins and 534 patients with M-mut. In Exon20ins patients, the median age was 60 (range 27-88) years, and females and never-smokers were predominant. Clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. In Exon20ins patients, 17 patients received platinum doublet as first-line therapy, and the overall response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were 11.8% and 8.9 months. Additionally, seven patients received conventional EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and eight patients anti-PD-1 antibodies in any-line therapy. ORR and mPFS of EGFR-TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were 0%, 2.2 months and 25%, 3.1 months, respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in Exon20ins patients than in M-mut patients (29.3 vs. 43.4 months, p = 0.04).

Catheter ablation is widely used for the management of AF. However, it is limited by relapse of the arrhythmia necessitating repeat procedures. AREAS COVERED This review aims to discuss the predictors of post-ablation recurrent AF including age, gender, genetic predisposition, AF type and duration, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, echocardiographic parameters of heart chambers, left atrial fibrosis and ablation strategies and targets. An extensive literature search was undertaken on PubMed and Google Scholar to obtain full texts of relevant AF-related articles. EXPERT OPINION Maintenance of stable sinus rhythm is the main intended outcome of AF ablation. Therefore, it is very crucial to identify the risk factors that may influence the ablation success. Most of these predictors such as comorbidities, ablation strategy and targets and lifestyle factors are either reversible or modifiable. Thus, not only the awareness of these known risk factors by both patients and their physicians but also future research to identify the unknown predictors are critical to optimize care in this multi-faceted morbidity.","Mohanty, Sanghamitra; Della Rocca, Domenico G; Gianni, Carola; Trivedi, Chintan; Mayedo, Angel Quintero; MacDonald, Bryan; Natale, Andrea",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2021.1892490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678103/,98

However, surprisingly little is known about the resources that moderate the effects of work-family conflict on health over time. Using four waves of panel data from the Canadian Work, Stress, and Health Study (2011-2017; n = 11,349 person-wave observations), we compare how a core psychosocial resource (personal mastery) and a salient organizationally based resource (schedule control) moderate the health effects of WFC and FWC. After establishing these health effects related to distress and physical symptoms, we discover that mastery has generalized stress-buffering functions whereby it alleviates the health effects of both WFC and FWC. In contrast, schedule control has asymmetrical moderating functions: It attenuates the health effects of WFC only. These findings elaborate and sharpen the scope of resources as moderators in the stress process model-and we integrate these ideas with other conceptual models like the job demands-resources model.","Badawy, Philip; Schieman, Scott",Journal of health and social behavior,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146520942897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723101/,98

However, only contact history and obesity remained statistically significant in the separated analysis of girls and boys. The results suggest that obesity is not only associated with severe disease but also increases risk for Covid-19. Contrary to findings in adults, no difference between cases and controls was found for gender, presence of pneumonia or surrogates of severe disease including admission to intensive care unit, tracheal intubation or whether patient had died.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out including patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 3 hospitals, health workers exposed to the infection and outpatients who met suspicious case criteria, all of which underwent the molecular test (RT-PCR) and the rapid serological test. The additional diagnostic performance of rapid serological test was evaluated in comparison to molecular tests. Likewise, an approximation was made to the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid serological test. RESULTS 144 people were included. With the rapid test, 19.4% of positive results were obtained compared to 11.1% in the molecular test (p = 0.03). The rapid serological test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial (RT-PCR), providing an additional diagnostic performance of 56.8% compared to the RT-PCR. The additional diagnostic performance was 50.0% during the first week, 70.0% during the second week and 50.0% during the third week of symptom onset. The sensitivity of the rapid serological test was 43.8% and the specificity of 98.9%. CONCLUSIONS The rapid serological test was able to detect a greater number of cases than those detected by the molecular test especially after the second week of onset of symptoms. It also showed high specificity. It is therefore useful as a complementary test to RT-PCR, especially during the second and third week of illness.","Vidal-Anzardo, Margot; Solis, Gilmer; Solari, Lely; Minaya, Gabriela; Ayala-Quintanilla, Beatriz; Astete-Cornejo, Jonh; Luque-Aguilar, Amparo; Jorge, Ana; Rojas, Nancy; Cardenas, Fanny; Soto, Alonso",Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,https://doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.372.5534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876207/,98

It has been reported in ocular infections including those of patients using contact lenses. Treatment is difficult because Acinetobacter is frequently multidrug resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains frequently also harbor genes for antiseptic resistance (quaternary ammonium compound [QAC]) genes. Because Acinetobacter is part of the normal flora, it may contaminate contact lens and accessories. This study aims to investigate carriage rates of QAC genes in household and clinical isolates of Acinetobacter and to determine the effectiveness of two multipurpose solutions (MPSs) for soft lenses against organisms carrying QAC genes. METHODS DNA was extracted from 11 bathroom isolates and 15 clinical isolates and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of qacEΔ1. Gene-positive and gene-negative control strains were used to challenge the two MPSs, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these organisms to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were determined. RESULTS More than 90% of isolates carried qacEΔ1. The MICs of clinical isolates were higher than those of isolates of bathrooms. Both MPSs were able to produce a 3-log reduction in the numbers of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS Although most isolates carried qacEΔ1 and elevated MICs to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were observed, all were susceptible to both MPSs tested. However, if there were to be poor compliance with care procedures, it is probable that such organisms could survive in the presence of diluted or expired solutions.","Boost, Maureen V; Chan, Jessica; Shi, Guang-sen; Cho, Pauline",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,https://doi.org/10.1097/opx.0000000000000177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509546/,98
123786,Mechanical esophageal deviation: an approach for pulmonary vein reconnection attributed to esophageal heating.,2016,"Purposes Seroma is a postoperative complication following laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) for inguinal hernioplasty. Seroma naturally resolves in most cases, but it can lead to an increased amount of visits to the outpatient clinic and can result in anxiety of the patient. Local inflammation of the inguinal area is etiology of seroma formation. Strangulated hernia involves severe inguinal pain and can lead to severe inflammation and subsequent seroma. There have been no reports demonstrating the links of seroma and strangulated hernia. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the risk of seroma after TAPP and to identify the association between strangulated hernia and seroma. Methods We treated 300 inguinal hernias by TAPP between 2013 and 2016 at Kurashiki Central Hospital. We used the Chi-square test. Factors significant in each association were further examined using multiple subsequent logistic regressions. Results A total of 222 hernias were eligible for analysis. The incidence of seroma was 11% (n=25). There were nine cases of strangulated hernias, and three (33%) resulted in seroma. The ratio of strangulated hernia of seroma group is significantly high (p<0.03). Multiple subsequent logistic regressions showed that strangulated hernia was associated with a significantly increased risk for seroma formation (p = 0.023; OR 6.564; 95% CI 1.29-33.3). Conclusion This study shows that strangulated hernia can be a risk factor in seroma formation. This risk should be incorporated into a management plan of TAPP for strangulated hernia, with careful consideration of patients' concerns.","Matsumoto, Ryu; Nagahisa, Yoshio; Hashida, Kazuki; Yokota, Mitsuru; Okabe, Michio; Kawamoto, Kazuyuki",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/6528075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30225141/,98

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The paper by Guller et al was subject to significant bias. The authors did not demonstrate an understanding of gastric banding, selectively included data with unfavorable results towards gastric banding, did not provide equal critique to the literature on gastric bypass, and deliberately excluded much of the favorable data on gastric banding.

125169,Discontinuation of Isolation Precautions for COVID-19 Patients.,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND The self-approximating transluminal access technique (STAT) has been demonstrated to provide safe transluminal access and in-line endoscope positioning to target abdominal organs during natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). To date, organ resection with NOTES has typically required percutaneous assistance. We hypothesized that the in-line positioning and partial stability provided by STAT would allow single-access NOTES procedures if a multiarticulated endoscope could be used. OBJECTIVE Assessment of single-site NOTES, using STAT and a prototype, multi-articulated endoscope. DESIGN Animal survival study. SETTING Penn State Hershey Medical Center Research Laboratories. INTERVENTIONS Thirteen pigs underwent NOTES using a prototype endoscope with 2 articulated channels, a grasping forceps, and an insulated-tip needle-knife. The gallbladder was dissected using a fundus down technique, and hemoclips and a detachable loop were placed on the cystic duct and artery before removal. After a 2- to 3-week observation period, animals were euthanized and necropsy performed. RESULTS All target organs were successfully resected without laparoscopic assistance. Significant complications were 2 perforations (1 caused by a prototype duodenal occlusion device and 1 caused by enterotomy during cholecystectomy) and 1 entrapment of the small bowel with an endoloop.

Lockdown, handwashing and social distancing are impossible privileges for many urban dwellers - measures which make structural inequities more visible, exacerbating racial, gender and class differences. There are many social determinants of health to explain these inequalities that trigger a high prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases. In Medellín (Colombia), it is a challenge to cope with this crisis, especially when the resources and aid provided by the government and institutions are limited. Yet, an organized social response is happening in some communes and slums, with high community participation, as a potentially effective key to control the pandemic. Once the emergency is over, communities in slums will have to face the social and economic reactivation, and effectively react to the multiple social and psychological consequences, new waves of COVID-19 or other pandemics.","Molina-Betancur, Juan Camilo; Martínez-Herrera, Eliana; Pericàs, Juan M; Benach, Joan",Global health promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975920962797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054562/,98

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety outcomes of this technique. METHODS Patients (n = 105) scheduled for elective LS were consecutively and prospectively enrolled, including 24 males and 81 females, with a mean age of 43.6 (range 11-75) years. Following the mobilization of the spleen, the splenic inflow was interrupted by applying a Hem-o-lock clip. LigaSure was used to seal and transect the secondary splenic pedicles adjacent to the pancreatic tail and subsequently in proximity to the spleen. RESULTS Of 105 patients, 103 patients (98.1%) underwent successful LS, whereas two patients (1.9%) required the conversion to laparotomy. The mean operative time was 100 min, whilst the mean volume of blood loss was 500 mL. No clinically significant morbidities or mortality occurred following LS. An average of 8,000 RMB (range: 6900 to 9000; 1 USD = 6.5 RMB) was saved by using this two-step technique. CONCLUSION Secondary splenic pedicles can be successfully controlled in LS by using a two-step technique with the LigaSure vessel sealing system in an economically favorable way.","Ji, Bai; Liu, Yahui; Zhang, Ping; Wang, Yingchao; Wang, Guangyi",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.4862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136536/,98

METHODS We analyzed data from 101 patients who underwent PG for upper third early gastric cancer between 1999 and 2011. In all, 64 patients underwent EG, 25 underwent jejunal interposition (JI), and 12 underwent jejunal pouch interposition (JPI). We compared intraoperative details and postoperative outcomes, and investigated the relationships between the degree of the fundoplication during EG and endoscopic findings. RESULTS The length of the operation was significantly shorter in the EG group than in the other 2 groups (P < .05), and the intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in the EG group (P < .05). The JI and the JPI groups had significantly greater rates of early complications than did the EG group (P = .01). Reflux esophagitis was present in 22% of patients in the EG group, 8% in the JPI group, and none in the JI group. In the EG group, reflux esophagitis was significantly less common in patients with a >180° wrap of the remnant stomach around the esophagus than in patients with a smaller wrap (P = .0008). The rate of body weight loss was significantly less in the EG group compared with the other 2 groups (P < .05). CONCLUSION Considering the low invasiveness of the procedure and postoperative outcomes, we consider that EG with a >180° wrap as the optimal reconstructive procedure.","Nakamura, Masaki; Nakamori, Mikihito; Ojima, Toshiyasu; Katsuda, Masahiro; Iida, Takeshi; Hayata, Keiji; Matsumura, Shuuichi; Kato, Tomoya; Kitadani, Junya; Iwahashi, Makoto; Yamaue, Hiroki",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2014.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799083/,98

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins are considered as a potential intermediate host. To assemble the genome of suspicious coronavirus (CoV) found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 was used as a reference in most of the previous studies, implicitly assuming the pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the choice of reference genome affected the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoVs as the reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as a reference showed better statistics in total length, N50, and pairwise distance reconstruction (PDR) scores than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 may be a better reference. Therefore, RaTG13 should also be considered as a reference for assembling suspicious CoV found in pangolins and other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Yuan; Yan, Changhui",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0219720021400059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971803/,98

135341,"COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or is it mast cell activation syndrome?",2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is endemic in several developing countries. Clinical manifestations of this infection vary widely from asymptomatic infection to uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. The pathogenesis of this disease and the reason of varying disease severity remain unknown. In viral infections, tissue injury can be caused either by virus itself or by host immune responses directed against infected cells. We therefore studied adaptive immune responses to HEV antigens in patients with hepatitis E of varying disease severity and healthy controls. METHODS Cytokine secreting CD4+ T cells and antibody-producing B cells specific for HEV were enumerated through intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, respectively. RESULTS Patients with fulminant hepatitis E had a less marked expansion of HEV-specific interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-a secreting CD4+ T cells than patients with uncomplicated hepatitis E and healthy controls. These patients also had fewer CD4+ T cells that produce γ-interferon or tumor necrosis factor-a upon in vitro polyclonal stimulation. In addition, patients with fulminant disease had a more marked expansion of B cells that can secrete immunoglobulin G anti-HEV than patients with uncomplicated infection and control patients. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that less-marked antiviral cellular immune responses and heightened antiviral humoral responses are associated with a more severe disease during HEV infection.","Srivastava, Ratika; Aggarwal, Rakesh; Sachdeva, Sanjeev; Alam, Mohammad Intakhab; Jameel, Shahid; Naik, Sita",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06356.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143520/,98

Methods: Data of reported COVID-19 cases and Baidu Migration Index of 21 cities in Guangdong province and other provinces of China as of February 25, 2020 were collected. The imported risk index of each city in Guangdong province were calculated, and then correlation analysis was performed between reported cases and the imported risk index to identify lag time. Finally, we classified the early warming levels of epidemic by imported risk index. Results: A total of 1 347 confirmed cases were reported in Guangdong province, and 90.0% of the cases were clustered in the Pearl River Delta region. The average daily imported risk index of Guangdong was 44.03. Among the imported risk sources of each city, the highest risk of almost all cities came from Hubei province, except for Zhanjiang from Hainan province. In addition, the neighboring provinces of Guangdong province also had a greater impact. The correlation between the imported risk index with a lag of 4 days and the daily reported cases was the strongest (correlation coefficient: 0.73). The early warning base on cumulative 4-day risk of each city showed that Dongguan, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, Foshan and Huizhou have high imported risks in the next 4 days, with imported risk indexes of 38.85, 21.59, 11.67, 11.25, 6.19 and 5.92, and the highest risk still comes from Hubei province. Conclusions: Cities with a large number of migrants in Guangdong province have a higher risk of import. Hubei province and neighboring provinces in Guangdong province are the main source of the imported risk. Each city must strengthen the health management of migrants in high-risk provinces and reduce the imported risk of Guangdong province.","Hu, J X; Liu, T; Xiao, J P; He, G H; Rong, Z H; Yin, L H; Wan, D H; Zeng, W L; Gong, D X; Guo, L C; Zhu, Z H; Zeng, L L; Kang, M; Song, T; Zhong, H J; He, J F; Sun, L M; Li, Y; Ma, W J",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200226-00190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213268/,98
139474,Mediterranean spotted fever associated with leucocytoclastic vasculitis and acute pancraeatitis.,2021-02-23,"INTRODUCTION Acute tandem occlusions of the cervical and distal internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) are associated with major stroke with intravenous (i.v.) thrombolysis alone in approximately 90 % of patients. The data on endovascular management of tandem occlusions is still limited. The purpose of this study was to review technical aspects and the current state of the literature on acute ICA stenting in combination with stent retriever-based intracranial thrombectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of 37 consecutive patients with tandem occlusions including clinical parameters, angiographic results, procedural aspects, complications, and hemorrhages. RESULTS Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission was 17 (3-30). Intracranial thrombectomy was performed prior to ICA stenting in 25/37 (67.6 %) and after stenting in 12/37 (32.4 %) patients. ICA stenting was successful in all cases, and a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scale 2b/3 result was achieved in 27/37 (73 %) cases. The mean angiography time was significantly shorter in the ""thrombectomy first"" group (43.1 ± 30.8 vs. 110.8 ± 43.0 min, p < 0.001), and more patients had favorable outcomes after 3 months (13/25 = 52.0 vs. 4/12 = 33.3 %, p = 0.319). In this group, intermediate catheters were used and successfully prevented embolism to unaffected territories in all cases. CONCLUSION Acute stenting of the cervical ICA in combination with intracranial thrombectomy was technically feasible and safe in our series. Thrombectomy prior to proximal stenting was associated with shorter reperfusion times and a tendency towards better clinical outcome leading to a good outcome in about 50 % of the patients. Therefore, we recommend this approach in tandem occlusion requiring stent angioplasty.","Lockau, H; Liebig, T; Henning, T; Neuschmelting, V; Stetefeld, H; Kabbasch, C; Dorn, F",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1465-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25404414/,98
140171,Congenital absence of the nasal septum in a Nigerian newborn with multiple congenital anomalies.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Degree of stent retriever engagement with target thrombi may be reflected by (1) immediate reperfusion (IR) on first deployment, indicating displacement of clot toward the vessel wall, and (2) by early loss of IR (ELOIR), indicating penetration of retriever struts through the thrombus. The relation of these early findings to final reperfusion and clinical outcomes has not been well delineated. METHODS We investigated IR and ELOIR in patients undergoing stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy at an academic medical center between March 2012 and June 2014. RESULTS Among 56 patients, IR itself was not associated with final successful reperfusion, which occurred in 66.7% of IR patients and 71.4% of non-IR patients (P=0.999). However, ELOIR was associated with a higher rate of final successful reperfusion (92% versus 44%; P=0.046). Patients with ELOIR had a higher nominal rate of final favorable outcome (42% versus 22%; P=0.64). CONCLUSIONS ELOIR during the embedding period after deployment of stent retrievers is associated with successful final reperfusion, likely because of greater thrombus engagement with the stent retriever. ELOIR may be a useful finding to guide duration of embedding time in clinical practice and design of novel stent retrievers.","Okawa, Masakazu; Tateshima, Satoshi; Liebeskind, David; Rao, Neal; Jahan, Reza; Gonzalez, Nestor; Szeder, Viktor; Ali, Latisha; Kim, Doojin; Saver, Jeffrey; Duckwiler, Gary",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.010794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26451013/,98

OBJECTIVES To examine fungal and bacterial growth on cleaned reusable lead wires, determine if microbial growth is associated with hospital site or work environment, determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and learn if antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with hospital site and work environment. METHODS Cleaned lead wires (N = 320) from critical care and telemetry units, emergency departments, and operating rooms of 4 hospitals were swabbed and the specimens cultured for microbial growth. Bacterial species were grouped by their risk for human infection: at risk (n = 9), potential risk (n = 5), and no risk (n = 10). Work environments were compared by using pairwise contrasts from a generalized estimating equation model. RESULTS Fungi were rare (0.6%). Of 226 cultures from 201 wires (62.8%) with bacterial growth, 121 were of at- or potential-risk bacteria (37.8%). Urban hospitals had less growth (P ≤ .001) and fewer bacterial species per wire (P ≤ .001) than did community hospitals. Presence of any bacteria (P = .02) and number of bacterial species per wire (P = .002) were lowest in operating rooms; emergency departments and telemetry units had more growth than did critical care units. Among specimens of staphylococci and enterococci, 6 each were sensitive to antibiotics; of 4 resistant staphylococcal species, 1 was not a human opportunistic pathogen and 3 were potential-risk species.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the willingness of body donation in Greece and determine the characteristics of donors. This cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from January to June 2011. A specially designed questionnaire was distributed to 1,700 individuals who were randomly selected from five major Greek cities. It was found that higher educational levels (P = 0.002), annual family income below 30,000 Euros (P = 0.001), guaranteed employment status (P = 0.02), and the presence of comorbid conditions (P = 0.004) seemed to affect potential donors' willingness for cadaveric donation. Those with strong religious beliefs were found to be unwilling to donate their bodies to medical science. Interestingly, the majority of participants who believed that hospitalized patients are deceived or are used for harmful experiments were willing to become whole body donors (P = 0.043). In Greece, the rate of body donation to medical science remains low, and most Greek citizens are not willing to become body donors.

National reporting does not include gender identity, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including those with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID factors that may increase vulnerability to COVID-19 related harms among transgender women. SETTING Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC METHODS:: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect vulnerability to COVID-related harms. RESULTS The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated, provider discomfort serving transgender women, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. CONCLUSIONS Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, Tonia C; Reisner, Sari L; Miller, Marissa; Wirtz, Andrea L",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852362/,98

METHODS AND RESULTS This study analysed data contained in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 16 765 patients with a first diagnosis of solitary AFL during 2001-2013. Eligible patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they had received ablation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to mitigate the effects of potential confounding factors. The primary outcome was occurrence of IS during follow-up. After 1:2 PSM, the analysis included 1037 patients in the ablation group and 2074 patients in the non-ablation group. The incidence of IS was lower in the ablation group compared to the non-ablation group [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.90] during the 2-year follow-up period but not thereafter (SHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72-1.48). When grouping by stroke history, it revealed that ablation affected the incidence of stroke in patients without history of stroke (SHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.91) but not in patients with history of stroke. When each group was stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score, ablation lowered the incidence of stroke in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc ≤3 (SHR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.60) but not in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥4 in the initial 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSION The different incidence of IS in patients with/without ablation indicates that ablation reduces the risk of IS in AFL patients.","Lin, Yu-Sheng; Wu, Victor Chien-Chia; Wang, Hui-Ting; Chen, Huang-Chung; Chen, Mien-Cheng; Chang, Shih-Tai; Chu, Pao-Hsien; Chen, Yung-Lung","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830229/,98

To identify antiviral small molecules with well-characterized safety and bioavailability profiles we screened a library of 2,907 approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds for inhibitors of ZIKV infection using a high-throughput cell-based immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, estrogen receptor modulators raloxifene hydrochloride and quinestrol were amongst 15 compounds that significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in repeat screens. Subsequent validation studies revealed that these drugs effectively inhibit ZIKV, DENV and WNV (Kunjin strain) infection at low micromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells and HTR-8 placental trophoblast cells. Since these cells lack detectable expression of estrogen receptors-α and -β (ER-α and ER-β) and similar antiviral effects were observed in the context of subgenomic DENV and ZIKV replicons, these compounds appear to inhibit viral RNA replication in a manner that is independent of their known effects on estrogen receptor signaling. Taken together, quinestrol, raloxifene hydrochloride and structurally related analogues warrant further investigation as potential therapeutics for treatment of flavivirus infections.","Eyre, Nicholas S; Kirby, Emily N; Anfiteatro, Daniel R; Bracho, Gustavo; Russo, Alice G; White, Peter A; Aloia, Amanda L; Beard, Michael R",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00289-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482672/,98

145601,Recovery of renal function after long-term dialysis and resolution of cardiomyopathy in a patient with aHUS receiving eculizumab.,2016,"A 76-year-old woman with right mandibular gingival cancer was scheduled for surgery. A percutaneous tracheostomy kit was used for tracheostomy under intravenous sedation. After puncturing the cricothyroid membrane, a dilator was inserted along a guidewire. Bucking was observed at the time of insertion of the dilator, despite intratracheal lidocaine spray applied before insertion. After that, the tracheostomy tube was inserted, but no capnographic waveforms appeared when the tube was connected to the anesthesia circuit. Direct macroscopic observation revealed a perforation extending from the posterior wall of the trachea to the anterior wall of the esophagus, which prompted us to request assistance from a thoracic surgeon for treatment before reinserting the tracheostomy tube. After verifying capnographic waveforms on the monitor, anesthesia was induced. Because arterial oxygen saturation was 96% under the administration of pure oxygen, chest radiography was conducted revealing a right pneumothorax. A chest tube was inserted and the patient transported to a nearby general hospital. We suspect that pneumothorax was induced when the integrity of the mediastinal pleura was compromised by mediastinal emphysema because of the injury to the posterior tracheal wall complicated by bucking at the time of insertion of the dilator.","Matsumura, Sarina; Kishimoto, Naotaka; Iseki, Tomio; Momota, Yoshihiro",Anesthesia progress,https://doi.org/10.2344/anpr-64-02-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28604085/,98

The mechanism of COVID-19-associated thrombophilia is unknown; increasing global reports of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positivity in COVID-19 suggest that the virus may induce antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a separate autoimmune thrombotic illness1. Because laboratory criteria used to diagnose APS are neither strongly specific nor sensitive, and because clinical circumstances including anticoagulation alter the laboratory results, international committees have published strict guidelines for aPL testing2,3.

We developed a novel approach for lobectomy in patients with right upper lung cancer through simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteries and veins. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of this minimally invasive technique in managing right upper lobectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS From March 2016 to September 2017, 62 patients with right upper lung cancer underwent lobectomy via simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteriovenous by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. All patients were followed up for 6-12 months after the procedure through clinic visits or telephone/e-mail interviews. RESULTS Of the 62 patients (mean age, 57.2 ± 8.7 years), 28 were men (45.2%) and 34 (54.8%) were women. All procedures were successfully performed by thoracoscopy, with a mean operating time of 66.2 ± 9.0 min. The mean blood loss was 40.3 ± 19.5 mL. Only 1 (1.61%) patient required blood transfusion. The mean number of endoscopic linear stapling devices used was 2.6 ± 0.7. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 16.0 ± 1.6. Postoperative pneumonia was encountered in 4 (6.45%) patients. There was no postoperative mortality. The mean length of hospital stay was 5.3 ± 1.3 days. Six-month follow-up revealed an excellent clinical result and degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS Simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteries and veins is a feasible, economical, safe, and effective therapeutic procedure for right upper lung carcinoma. This novel procedure shows promise as a viable surgical approach for right upper lobectomy.","Lin, Jian-Bo; Qiu, Ming-Lian; Lin, Chun-Jin; Li, Xu; Chen, Jian-Feng; Lai, Fan-Cai; Liu, Bo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-06659-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617423/,98

METHODS In a series of 10 injected cadaver heads, the transtuberculum (""above"") and transclival (""below"") approaches were combined, without pituitary transposition. Using 0-degree, 30-degree, and 45-degree endoscopes, the extent of overlap and if a blind spot occurred were determined. Also, the visualization of the IC was compared with the transposition of the pituitary gland approach. Nonparametric statistics were used to evaluate the results. The approach was implemented in 2 patients. RESULTS For both the ""above"" and ""below"" views, there was a statistically significant increase in field of view when comparing the 0-degree endoscope with either the 30-degree endoscope (P < 0.05) or the 45-degree endoscope (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the 30-degree endoscope and the 45-degree endoscope (P > 0.05) in the ""below"" approach, but there was a difference (P < 0.05) in the ""above"" approach. There was no blind spot with any combination of endoscopes. There was no practical statistically significant difference between the transposition approach and the ""above and below"" approach. The ""above and below"" approach was used successfully in 2 surgeries. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to work both ""above"" and ""below"" the pituitary gland to reach the IC through an endoscopic endonasal approach. The advantages are the maintenance of normal pituitary and parasellar anatomy and the minimization of the size of the skull base defect. There is no blind spot using this approach that would be revealed with a pituitary transposition. The feasibility of this approach has been confirmed in 2 patients.","Silva, Danilo; Attia, Moshe; Kandasamy, Jothy; Alimi, Marjan; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2012.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022634/,98

Eligible patients were identified from an administrative claims database, and consenting patients were asked to complete a structured telephone interview and several validated questionnaires. Questionnaires assessed pain interference with function (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form), health status (Short Form 12 [SF-12] Health Survey), disability (Sheehan Disability Scale), work performance (World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire), and mood (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Screener [GAD-7] and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2]).

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence surrounding the treatment of these patients during this pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations with attention to increased risk in this setting. DATA SOURCES A review of the literature was performed with PubMed. Because recently published articles on this topic may not yet be indexed into PubMed, otolaryngology journals were hand searched for relevant articles. Guidelines from national organizations were reviewed to identify additional relevant sources of information. REVIEW METHODS Two groups of search terms were created: one with terms related to COVID-19 and another with terms related to head and neck cancer and its management. Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups. Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state. Care must be taken at all stages of treatment to minimize the risk to patients and health care workers while maintaining focus on minimizing use of limited resources.

156991,A New Lung Ultrasound Protocol Able to Predict Worsening in Patients Affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pneumonia.,2020-11-06,"IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats-1) is an effector of the host innate immune antiviral response that prevents propagation of virus infection by selectively inhibiting translation of viral mRNA. It relies on its ability to compete with the translation initiation factor eIF4F to specifically recognize foreign capped mRNAs, while remaining inactive against host mRNAs marked by ribose 2'-O methylation at the first cap-proximal nucleotide (N1). We report here several crystal structures of RNA-bound human IFIT1, including a 1.6-Å complex with capped RNA. IFIT1 forms a water-filled, positively charged RNA-binding tunnel with a separate hydrophobic extension that unexpectedly engages the cap in multiple conformations (syn and anti) giving rise to a relatively plastic and nonspecific mode of binding, in stark contrast to eIF4E. Cap-proximal nucleotides encircled by the tunnel provide affinity to compete with eIF4F while allowing IFIT1 to select against N1 methylated mRNA. Gel-shift binding assays confirm that N1 methylation interferes with IFIT1 binding, but in an RNA-dependent manner, whereas translation assays reveal that N1 methylation alone is not sufficient to prevent mRNA recognition at high IFIT1 concentrations. Structural and functional analysis show that 2'-O methylation at N2, another abundant mRNA modification, is also detrimental for RNA binding, thus revealing a potentially synergistic role for it in self- versus nonself-mRNA discernment. Finally, structure-guided mutational analysis confirms the importance of RNA binding for IFIT1 restriction of a human coronavirus mutant lacking viral N1 methylation. Our structural and biochemical analysis sheds new light on the molecular basis for IFIT1 translational inhibition of capped viral RNA.","Abbas, Yazan M; Laudenbach, Beatrice Theres; Martínez-Montero, Saúl; Cencic, Regina; Habjan, Matthias; Pichlmair, Andreas; Damha, Masad J; Pelletier, Jerry; Nagar, Bhushan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1612444114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28251928/,98

Here we examine two 5'-proximal cis-replication signals of different character in a defective interfering (DI) RNA of the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) that map within a 322-nucleotide (nt) sequence (136 nt from the genomic 5' untranslated region and 186 nt from the nonstructural protein 1 [nsp1]-coding region) not found in the otherwise-identical nonreplicating subgenomic mRNA7 (sgmRNA7). The natural DI RNA is structurally a fusion of the two ends of the BCoV genome that results in a single open reading frame between a partial nsp1-coding region and the entire N gene. (i) In the first examination, mutation analyses of a recently discovered long-range RNA-RNA base-paired structure between the 5' untranslated region and the partial nsp1-coding region showed that it, possibly in concert with adjacent stem-loops, is a cis-acting replication signal in the (+) strand. We postulate that the higher-order structure promotes (+)-strand synthesis. (ii) In the second examination, analyses of multiple frame shifts, truncations, and point mutations within the partial nsp1-coding region showed that synthesis of a PEFP core amino acid sequence within a group A lineage betacoronavirus-conserved NH2-proximal WAPEFPWM domain is required in cis for DI RNA replication. We postulate that the nascent protein, as part of an RNA-associated translating complex, acts to direct the DI RNA to a critical site, enabling RNA replication. We suggest that these results have implications for viral genome replication and explain, in part, why coronavirus sgmRNAs fail to replicate. IMPORTANCE cis-Acting RNA and protein structures that regulate (+)-strand RNA virus genome synthesis are potential sites for blocking virus replication. Here we describe two: a previously suspected 5'-proximal long-range higher-order RNA structure and a novel nascent NH2-terminal protein component of nsp1 that are common among betacoronaviruses of group A lineage.","Su, Yu-Pin; Fan, Yi-Hsin; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00738-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872586/,98

162666,Large Scale Manufacturing Strategy for Production of Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Support of Clinical Trials,2021,"BACKGROUND Proportional assist ventilation+ (PAV+) delivers airway pressure (P aw) in proportion to patient effort (P mus) by using the equation of motion of the respiratory system. PAV+ calculates automatically respiratory mechanics (elastance and resistance); the work of breathing (WOB) is estimated by the ventilator. The accuracy of P mus estimation and hence accuracy of the delivered P aw and WOB calculation have not been assessed. This study aimed at assessing the accuracy of delivered P aw and calculated WOB by PAV+ and examining the factors influencing this accuracy. METHODS Using an active lung model with different respiratory mechanics, we compared (1) the actual delivered P aw by the ventilator to the theoretical P aw as defined by the equation of motion and (2) the WOB value displayed by the ventilator to the WOB measured from a Campbell diagram. RESULTS Irrespective of respiratory mechanics and gain, the ventilator provided a P aw approximately 25 % lower than expected. This underassistance was greatest at the beginning of the inspiration. Intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi), associated with an increase in trigger delay, was a major factor affecting PAV+ accuracy. The absolute value of total WOB displayed by the ventilator was underestimated, but the changes in WOB were accurately detected by the ventilator. CONCLUSION The assistance provided by PAV+ well follows P mus but with a constant underassistance. This is associated with an underestimation by the ventilator of the WOB. PEEPi can be a major factor contributing to PAV+ inaccuracy. Clinical recommendations should include using a high trigger sensitivity and a careful PEEP titration.","Beloncle, Francois; Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Rittayamai, Nuttapol; Lyazidi, Aissam; Brochard, Laurent",Annals of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-016-0131-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076185/,98

Generally, type I and II interferons are essential cytokines to combat viral infections including COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 adopts evasion mechanisms to overcome interferon-mediated antiviral responses and neutralizes a key human defensive strategy. The aim of this mini-review is to survey both beneficial and non-beneficial effects of interferon during COVID-19 disease course. The indication of interferon-α2b or interferon β-1a has shown benefit at the early stages of COVID-19 in some clinical trials;though, interferon administration could only help in the incubation period or before the peak viral load. The incubation period and the duration from the symptom onset till the peak viral load has been estimated 5-6 and 2-3 days, respectively. On the other hand, an increase of interferon level in the disease’s late stages leads to delayed recovery and probably increased mortality rates due to the upregulation of ACE-2 expression in human airway epithelial cells, leading to the facilitation of virus entry into the host cells. Besides, it promotes the overactivation of inflammatory responses, which often happens in the disease’s pulmonary phase causing the cytokine storm. In this stage, antiviral agents might not work, and anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids (dexamethasone or prednisolone), tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), or anakinra (a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist), are beneficial. Some other proposed drugs such as TNF-α inhibitors and JAK inhibitors need further investigations in future studies.","Parashkouhi, S. N.; Mosaddeghi, P.; Bagheri, A.; Moezzi, S. M. I.; Hoseini, S.

RNAs exhibit about 100 modified bases that are essential for proper function. Among internal modified bases, the N6-methyladenosine, or m6A, is the most frequent, and is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 immune response evasion. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is RNA, almost all genomes sequenced so far are in fact, reverse transcribed complementary DNAs. This process reduces the true complexity of these viral genomes because incorporation of dNTPs hides RNA base modifications. Here, in this perspective paper, we present an initial exploration of the Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the m6A residues in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10 and the 3’-untranslated region. We identified 15 m6A methylated positions, of which, 6 are in ORF N. Also, because m6A is associated with the DRACH motif, we compared its distribution in major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although DRACH is highly conserved among variants we show that variants Beta and Eta have a fourth position C>U change in DRACH at 28,884b that could affect methylation. The Nanopore technology offers a unique opportunity for the study of viral epitranscriptomics. This technique is PCR-free and is not sequencing-by-synthesis, therefore, no PCR bias and synthesis errors are introduced. The modified bases are preserved and assessed directly with no need for chemical treatments or antibodies. This is the first report of direct RNA sequencing of a Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sample coupled with the identification of modified bases.","Campos, João H.; Maricato, Juliana T.; Braconi, Carla T.; Antoneli, Fernando; Janini, Luiz Mario R.; Briones, Marcelo R.

The initial impression that children have been less susceptible to the virus when compared with adults has changed recently, with an increasing number of paediatric data becoming more available. The paediatric data have shown a very low mortality rate among the children. The studies in children from China showed the predominance of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms;however, few studies outside china reported the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Also, the guidelines on the use of specific antiviral and other therapeutic agents in children are limited to few drugs with the use of some of them on compassionate ground.

173498,Effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-08-28,"Most people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus show respiratory illness. As the virus is newly discovered, the world is not ready with an adequate number of testing kits so as to test each individual in the world. So, a different method that tells if a person may be infected or not will prove to be a big relief and will also help in decreasing the tension and fear among people. This problem can be solved by training machines using deep learning algorithms. The proposed CNN model takes input as chest X-ray images and predicts whether a person needs to go for COVID-19 testing or not. This will decrease the fear of being COVID-19 infected and can be easily implemented even in rural areas;which will also decrease the load of the COVID-19 testing team. At present, the COVID-19 tests are being done clinically through blood tests or nose/throat swab tests which requires around 24 h to give results. The proposed recommendation system takes around 35 min to give the result of a sample and curbs down the chances of virus spread through contact while testing, unlike the presently used methods. The experimental results yielded an accuracy of 97.62% using the chest X-ray scans and requires less computational time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sinha, N.; Karjee, P.; Agrawal, R.; Banerjee, A.; Pradhan, C.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74761-9_7,98

However, therapeutic applications of short to medium chain fatty acids are limited by physical characteristics such as immiscibility in aqueous solutions. We evaluated a novel proprietary formulation based on an emulsion of short chain caprylic acid, ViroSAL, for its ability to inhibit a range of viral infections in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, ViroSAL inhibited the enveloped viruses Epstein-Barr, measles, herpes simplex, Zika and orf parapoxvirus, together with Ebola, Lassa, vesicular stomatitis and SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Evaluation of the components of ViroSAL revealed that caprylic acid was the main antiviral component; however, the ViroSAL formulation significantly inhibited viral entry compared with caprylic acid alone. In vivo, ViroSAL significantly inhibited Zika and Semliki Forest Virus replication in mice following the inoculation of these viruses into mosquito bite sites. In agreement with studies investigating other free fatty acids, ViroSAL had no effect on norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that its mechanism of action may be via surfactant disruption of the viral envelope. We have identified a novel antiviral formulation that is of great interest for prevention and/or treatment of a broad range of enveloped viruses.","Fletcher, Nicola F.; Meredith, Luke W.; Tidswell, Emma; Bryden, Steven R; Gonçalves-Carneiro, Daniel; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Lowe, Claire Shannon; Folan, Michael A.; Lefteri, Daniella A; Pingen, Marieke; Bailey, Dalan; McKimmie, Clive S.; Baird, Alan W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.009464,98

This study on a Russian sample (N = 308) took place during April-May 2020. We used verbal tasks on social distancing to test the hypotheses that individual differences in empathy, implicit theories of emotions, the Dark Triad traits, rationality, and risk readiness predict decisions on whether or not to wear a mask. We developed five verbal tasks - situations where decisions on whether to wear a mask or not were made by choosing from several given reasons. Among the reasons for wearing a mask, Care for Self was chosen by 46% of participants who received this as a reason, the Law-abidingness reason was chosen by 44%, and 31% selected Care for Others. Regarding the reasons for not wearing a mask, 16% of participants chose Autonomy for Oneself, 11% - Risk Underestimation and 5% - Autonomy for Others. Logistic regressions identified that empathy, rationality, and narcissism were significant predictors of a decision to wear a face mask, while risk readiness and psychopathy were predictors of a decision not to wear a mask. Implicit theories of emotions and problem-solving self-efficacy were significant predictors only for choices between the reasons for wearing a mask. Personality variables of empathy, rationality, risk readiness, and the Dark Triad traits influence decisions on adhering to physical distancing.","Zirenko, M. S.; Kornilova, T.

Although studies show good efficacy after two doses, there is limited data on the fate of the elicited antibody responses over time in groups with or without prior exposure to SARS-CoV2. Therefore, in this study we proposed to test naive or previously exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) longitudinally after both doses for anti-SARS-CoV2 spike antibody (ASSA) levels. Serum samples were collected from 205 HCWs at days 14 and 28 after first dose, and at days 14, 28 and 3-months after second dose. ASSA levels were quantitated by ECLIA method. Non-responder rate was 17% (35 of 205) on day 14 and 2% (5 of 205) on day 28 after the first dose. After the second dose, the responder rate was 100%. Non-responder rate was significantly higher among males (p<0.00001) and senior citizens (p=0.008). The second dose boosted a 27-fold increase in the COVID-19 naive (CN) group, but caused a 1.5-fold decline in the previously exposed groups. By three months, the antibody levels declined 3-4-folds in all the groups. In spite of high antibody levels (GM-1007 U per ml) after the second dose, 14% developed mild breakthrough infections (BTI). The booster effect was significantly higher when given 10-14 weeks later. The responder rate for Covishield was 98% after first dose and 100% after second dose. The vaccine elicited a prime-boost effect in CN HCWs and a boost-anergy effect in the previously exposed HCWs.

To address this issue, we propose an augmented multicenter graph convolutional network (AM-GCN) to diagnose COVID-19 with steps as follows. First, we use a 3-D convolutional neural network to extract features from the initial CT scans, where a ghost module and a multitask framework are integrated to improve the network's performance. Second, we exploit the extracted features to construct a multicenter graph, which considers the intercenter heterogeneity and the disease status of training samples. Third, we propose an augmentation mechanism to augment training samples which forms an augmented multicenter graph. Finally, the diagnosis results are obtained by inputting the augmented multi-center graph into GCN.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during November and December 2020. Study population included 57 nurses working in mobile COVID-19 testing units in Attica, Greece. We collected demographic data from the nurses, i.e. gender, age, marital status, children, living status (alone or with others), clinical experience, and chronic disease. We used the fear of COVID-19 scale to measure fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The mean score on the fear of COVID-19 scale was 14.3. Among nurses, 31.6% experienced elevated fear indicative of presence of anxiety symptoms, while the respective percentages for health anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptomatology were 22.8% and 17.5%. Fear of COVID-19 was not affected by demographic variables. However, fear was higher in females, nurses who had children and nurses who lived with others. Increased clinical experience was related with decreased fear. Conclusions: Creating a secure work environment for nurses in these units could decrease fear of COVID-19 and increase work performance.","Galanis, P.

187399,Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated With COVID-19.,2020-07-15,"Murine coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infect mouse cells via cellular receptors that are isoforms of biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) of the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family (G. S. Dveksler, C. W. Dieffenbach, C. B. Cardellichio, K. McCuaig, M. N. Pensiero, G.-S. Jiang, N. Beauchemin, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 67:1-8, 1993). The Bgp isoforms are generated through alternative splicing of the mouse Bgp1 gene that has two allelic forms called MHVR (or mmCGM1), expressed in MHV-susceptible mouse strains, and mmCGM2, expressed in SJL/J mice, which are resistant to MHV. We here report the cloning and characterization of a new Bgp-related gene designated Bgp2. The Bgp2 cDNA allowed the prediction of a 271-amino-acid glycoprotein with two immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane, and a putative cytoplasmic tail. There is considerable divergence in the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal domains of the proteins coded by the Bgp1 gene from that of the Bgp2-encoded protein. RNase protection assays and RNA PCR showed that Bgp2 was expressed in BALB/c kidney, colon, and brain tissue, in SJL/J colon and liver tissue, in BALB/c and CD1 spleen tissue, in C3H macrophages, and in mouse rectal carcinoma CMT-93 cells. When Bgp2-transfected hamster cells were challenged with MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, or MHV-3, the Bgp2-encoded protein served as a functional MHV receptor, although with a lower efficiency than that of the MHVR glycoprotein. The Bgp2-mediated virus infection could not be inhibited by monoclonal antibody CC1 that is specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR. Although CMT-93 cells express both MHVR and Bgp2, infection with the three strains of MHV was blocked by pretreatment with monoclonal antibody CC1, suggesting that MHVR was the only functional receptor in these cells. Thus, a novel murine Bgp gene has been identified that can be coexpressed in inbred mice with the Bgp1 glycoproteins and that can serve as a receptor for MHV strains when expressed in transfected hamster cells.","Nédellec, P; Dveksler, G S; Daniels, E; Turbide, C; Chow, B; Basile, A A; Holmes, K V; Beauchemin, N",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8207827/,98

201571,Distinctive trajectories of the COVID-19 epidemic by age and gender: A retrospective modeling of the epidemic in South Korea,2020,"BACKGROUND Almost all patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) eventually develop respiratory failure. Once 24 h ventilation is required, either due to incomplete effectiveness of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or bulbar weakness, it is common practice to recommend invasive tracheostomy ventilation; however, noninvasive daytime mouthpiece ventilation (MPV) as an addition to nocturnal mask ventilation is also an alternative. METHODS The authors' experience with 12 DMD patients who used 24 h NIV with mask NIV at night and MPV during daytime hours is reported. RESULTS The mean (± SD) age and vital capacity (VC) at initiation of nocturnal (only) NIV subjects were 17.8±3.5 years and 0.90±0.40 L (21% predicted), respectively; and, at the time of MPV, 19.8±3.4 years and 0.57 L (13.2% predicted), respectively. In clinical practice, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were measured using different methods: arterial blood gas analysis, transcutaneous partial pressure of CO2 and, predominantly, by end-tidal CO2. While the results suggested improved CO2 levels, these were not frequently confirmed by arterial blood gas measurement. The mean survival on 24 h NIV has been 5.7 years (range 0.17 to 12 years). Of the 12 patients, two deaths occurred after 3.75 and four years, respectively, on MPV; the remaining patients continue on 24 h NIV (range two months to 12 years; mean 5.3 years; median 3.5 years). CONCLUSIONS Twenty-four hour NIV should be considered a safe alternative for patients with DMD because its use may obviate the need for tracheostomy in patients with chronic respiratory failure requiring more than nocturnal ventilation alone.","McKim, Doug A; Griller, Nadia; LeBlanc, Carole; Woolnough, Andrew; King, Judy",Canadian respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23457679/,98
201981,Successful recovery of severe COVID-19 with cytokine storm treating with extracorporeal blood purification,2020,"Glycoproteins are proteins that carry N- and O-glycosidically-linked carbohydrate chains of complex structures and functions. N-glycan chains are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi by a controlled sequence of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase processing reactions involving dolichol intermediates. The assembly of O-glycans occurs in the Golgi and does not involve dolichol. For most reactions, families of glycosyltransferases exist; the expression of the individual enzymes within a family is often subject to complex regulation. The biosynthesis of N- and O-glycan is controlled at the level of gene expression, mRNA, enzyme protein activity and localization, and through substrate and cofactor concentrations at the site of synthesis. This complex regulation results in many hundreds of structures, the range of which varies in different species, cell types, tissue types, states of development and differentiation. In diseased cells, the relative proportions of these structures are often characteristically different from normal, and may be useful for the assessment of the stage of the disease and for diagnosis. Knowledge of disease-specific glycoprotein structures and their functions may be used therapeutically, in immunotherapy, in blocking cell adhesion or interfering with other binding or biological processes. Recently, some of the mechanisms underlying glycoprotein alterations in disease have been elucidated. This opens the possibility of an active interference in the disease process. The functions of glycans in diseased cells will become more clear with the tools of molecular biology and transgenic animal models.","Brockhausen, I; Schutzbach, J; Kuhns, W",Acta anatomica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9780351/,98

An effective treatment strategy for its prevention has not yet been defined. This review aimed to provide a viewpoint on the role of mesalazine, also note as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), in the prevention of diverticulitis. A systematic electronic search of relevant articles was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open trials, and retrospective studies, published between January 1999 and January 2020, were identified. Twelve eligible studies that analyzed primary or secondary outcomes of diverticulitis were included. The population included patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), or patients with a history of diverticulitis. All studies compared 5-ASA to placebo, rifaximin, or other treatments. Two studies, including 359 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA in preventing the first appearance of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD. Of these, one showed that 5-ASA was effective, and one did not. Ten studies, including 2.995 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with a history of diverticulitis. Four studies showed that 5-ASA had a certain degree of efficacy. All four RCTs demonstrated that 5-ASA did not significantly reduce the rate of diverticulitis recurrence. In a retrospective trial, 5-ASA was less effective than rifaximin in preventing diverticulitis recurrence. In an open trial, there was no difference between 5-ASA and probiotic treatment. Overall, there is currently conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in the prevention of diverticulitis and further RCTs are needed.","Stefanelli, G; Viscido, A; Valvano, M; Vernia, F; Frieri, G; Ashktorab, H; Latella, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,98

BACKGROUND: Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. METHODS: An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID-19 pandemic between October-December 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33 ± 15.05. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way.

205290,Right paraduodenal hernia with extensive bowel gangrene treated with staged surgery: a Bogota bag followed by resection in a low-resource setting,2021,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the relationship between nurses' exposure to violence and their professional commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. METHODS: An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID-19 pandemic between October-December 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33 ± 15.05. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way. In managing the pandemic process, the decisions and practices should not be left to the managers' initiative to prevent mobbing. Initiatives that will increase nurses' professional commitment during the pandemic process should be planned and implemented.","Özkan Sat, Sultan; Akbas, Pinar; Yaman Sözbir, Sengül",J. clin. nurs,,98
206233,"CCR5 inhibition in critical COVID-19 patients decreases inflammatory cytokines, increases CD8 T-cells, and decreases SARS-CoV2 RNA in plasma by day 14",2020,"BACKGROUND: Long waiting times for elective surgery are common to many publicly funded health systems. Inefficiencies in referral systems in high-income countries are more pronounced than lower and middle-income countries. Primary care practitioners play a major role in determining which patients are referred to surgeon and might represent an opportunity to improve this situation. With conventional methods of referrals, surgery clinics are often overcrowded with non-surgical referrals and surgical patients experience longer waiting times as a consequence. Improving the quality of referral communications should lead to more timely access and better cost-effectiveness for elective surgical care. This review summarises the research evidence for effective interventions within the scope of primary-care referral methods in the surgical care pathway that might shorten waiting time for elective surgeries. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases in December-2019 to January-2020, for articles published after 2013. Eligibility criteria included major elective surgery lists of adult patients, excluding cancer related surgeries. Both randomised and non-randomised controlled studies were eligible. The quality of evidence was assessed using ROBINS-I, AMSTAR 2 and CASP, as appropriate to the study method used. The review presentation was limited to a narrative synthesis because of heterogeneity. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42019158455. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 7543 records. Finally, nine articles were considered as eligible after deduplication and full article screening. The eligible research varied widely in design, scope, reported outcomes and overall quality, with one randomised trial, two quasi-experimental studies, two longitudinal follow up studies, three systematic reviews and one observational study. All the six original articles were based on referral methods in high-income countries. The included research showed that patient triage and prioritisation at the referral stage improved timely access and increased the number of consultations of surgical patients in clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The available studies included a variety of interventions and were of medium to high quality researches. Managing patient referrals with proper triaging and prioritisation using structured referral formats is likely to be effective in health systems to shorten the waiting times for elective surgeries, specifically in high-income countries.","Rathnayake, Dimuthu; Clarke, Mike",BMC Health Serv Res,,98

Alternatively, Universities worldwide has embraced digital learning in order to sustain the academic activities. Regrettably, Nigerians' Universities are still under lock and keys in view of poor or lack of digital learning equipment and experts. This study ascertains Nigeria's readiness towards digital learning, prospects, challenges and policy options amidst Covid 19 pandemic. Evaluation theory in line with qualitative research design was used to analyze the research questions. The finding showed that though meaningful efforts has been made by few of the private universities but the public universities are not good enough for full implementation of digital learning. The study suggested a liberalization of the educational sector from the bureaucratic bottleneck that has bedeviled its transformational development over the years and concluded that education as a key to national development cannot be relegated to the background but must be fully funded and adequately equipped to face the challenges of sustainable development.","Nwachukwu, Stephen Tochukwu Ugwu Chinweoke Methodius Wogu Joseph O.",Library Philosophy and Practice,,98
206507,Type I IFN immunoprofiling in COVID-19 patients,2020,"We propose a model with involuntary unemployment, incomplete markets, and nominal rigidity, in which the effects of government spending are state-dependent. An increase in government purchases raises aggregate demand, tightens the labor market and reduces unemployment. This in turn lowers unemployment risk and thus precautionary saving, leading to a larger response of private consumption than in a model with perfect insurance. The output multiplier is further amplified through a composition effect, as the fraction of high-consumption households in total population increases in response to the spending shock. These features, along with the matching frictions in the labor market, generate significantly larger multipliers in recessions than in expansions. As the pool of job seekers is larger during downturns than during expansions, the concavity of the job-finding probability with respect to market tightness implies that an increase in government spending reduces unemployment risk more in the former case than in the latter, giving rise to countercyclical multipliers.","Albertini, Julien; Auray, Stéphane; Bouakez, Hafedh; Eyquem, Aurélien",Journal of monetary economics,,98

209333,Routine asymptomatic testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation study,2021,"Although numerous reports predict huge growth potential for online shopping under COVID-19 pandemic, many do not know about determinants of user intention to continue using online shopping under such a pandemic. Given that how to motivate continuousness and retain consumers under a pandemic is critical to the online retailers and relevant stakeholders’ success, research on the determinants of intention to continuance using online shopping has attracted widespread attentiveness. The determinants of intention to continue using online shopping under COVID-19 pandemic, especially in India, have not yet been researched. Therefore, this study proposes a model combining the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) with task-technology fit (TTF) model and the trust factor to examine intention to continue using online shopping under COVID-19. Based on data gathered from 222 online participants during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19, the findings revealed that perceived TTF is much significant factor;satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and trust have positive impacts on consumers’ intention to continue usage of online shopping under COVID-19. Additionally, confirmation directly affects satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and indirectly affects consumers’ intention to continuance usage. The study’s findings provide online retailers and related stakeholders with significant managerial implications. © 2021 The Author(s).

An increased PCT level of PCT in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases would be assumed as bacterial coinfection. Could PCT level increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection without bacterial coinfection? Several SARS-CoV-2 proteins activate STAT3-dependent transcriptional pathways particularly in monocytes, that could lead to increased PCT production.

213059,Immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection - where do we stand and where are we heading?,2021,"BACKGROUND: FAP (fibroblast activation protein) plays an important role in cardiac wound healing and remodeling. Although initially developed as a theranostic ligand for metastasized cancer, FAPI (FAP inhibitor) tracers have recently been used to study cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction in small-animal models. The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of FAP via FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in human hearts. METHODS: FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 229 patients of 2 consecutive cohorts (modeling cohort: n=185; confirmatory cohort: n=44) suffering from metastasized cancer were analyzed applying the American Heart Association 17-segment model of the left ventricle. Logistic regression models were created using data from the modeling cohort. Multivariate regression models were established using Akaike information criterion in a step-down approach. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of patients had preexisting coronary artery disease (n=31), 33% arterial hypertension (n=75), and 12% diabetes mellitus type II (n=28). Forty-three percent had been treated with platin derivatives (n=100), 14% with anthracyclines (n=32), and 10% had a history of prior radiation to the chest (n=23). High left ventricular FAPI signals correlated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio [OR], 4.3, P=0.0029), a focal myocardial signal pattern (OR, 3.9, P=0.0068), diabetes mellitus type II (OR, 4.1, P=0.046), and beta-blocker use (OR, 3.8, P=0.049) in univariate regression models. In a multivariate analysis, increased signal intensity was significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (overweight [OR, 2.6, P=0.023], diabetes mellitus type II [OR, 2.9, P=0.041], certain chemotherapies [platinum derivatives; OR, 3.0, P=0.034], and a history of radiation to the chest [OR, 3.5, P=0.024]). A focal enrichment pattern was more frequently observed in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans represent a new imaging modality to investigate cardiac FAP. High signal intensities correlate with cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic disease.","Heckmann, Markus B; Reinhardt, Finn; Finke, Daniel; Katus, Hugo A; Haberkorn, Uwe; Leuschner, Florian; Lehmann, Lorenz H",Circ Cardiovasc Imaging,,98

216390,Heart transplant recipient patient with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab,2020,"The traditional manual age estimation method is crucial labor based on many kinds of the X-Ray image. Some current studies have shown that lateral cephalometric(LC) images can be used to estimate age. However, these methods are based on manually measuring some image features and making age estimates based on experience or scoring. Therefore, these methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the effect will be affected by subjective opinions. In this work, we propose a saliency map-enhanced age estimation method, which can automatically perform age estimation based on LC images. Meanwhile, it can also show the importance of each region in the image for age estimation, which undoubtedly increases the method's Interpretability. Our method was tested on 3014 LC images from 4 to 40 years old. The MEA of the experimental result is 1.250, which is less than the result of the state-of-the-art benchmark because it performs significantly better in the age group with fewer data. Besides, our model is trained in each area with a high contribution to age estimation in LC images, so the effect of these different areas on the age estimation task was verified. Consequently, we conclude that the proposed saliency map enhancements chronological age estimation method of lateral cephalometric radiographs can work well in chronological age estimation task, especially when the amount of data is small. Besides, compared with traditional deep learning, our method is also interpretable.","Liu, Ningtao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11805v1.pdf,98

There remains an urgent need to address the clinical significance of laboratory finding changes in predicting disease progression in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to analyze the clinical and immunological features of severe and critically severe patients with COVID-19 in comparison with non-severe patients and identify risk factors for disease severity and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. Methods: The consecutive records of 211 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of the 211 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 111 patients were classified as non-severe, 59 as severe, and 41 as critically severe cases. The median age was obviously higher in severe and critically severe cases than in non-severe cases. Severe and critically severe patients showed more underlying comorbidities than non-severe patients. Fever was the predominant presenting symptom in COVID-19 patients, and the duration of fever was longer in critically severe patients. Moreover, patients with increased levels of serum aminotransferases and creatinine (CREA) were at a higher risk for severe and critical COVID-19 presentations. The serum levels of IL-6 in severe and critically severe patients were remarkably higher than in non-severe patients. Lymphopenia was more pronounced in severe and critically severe patients compared with non-severe patients. Lymphocyte subset analysis indicated that severe and critically severe patients had significantly decreased count of lymphocyte subpopulations, such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells. A multivariate logistic analysis indicated that older age, male sex, the length of hospital stay, body temperature before admission, comorbidities, higher white blood cell (WBC) counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased levels of IL-6 were significantly associated with predicting the progression to severe stage of COVID-19. Conclusion: Older age, male sex, underlying illness, sustained fever status, abnormal liver and renal functions, excessive expression of IL-6, lymphopenia, and selective loss of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were related to disease deterioration and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. This study would provide clinicians with valuable information for risk evaluation and effective interventions for COVID-19.","Wang, Man; Fan, Yongzhen; Chai, Yuqiong; Cheng, Wenlin; Wang, Kun; Cao, Jianlei; Hu, Xiaorong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,98

217959,Severe consequences of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated kidney transplant recipients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid emergence and the high disease burden of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have created a medical need for readily available drugs that can decrease viral replication or blunt the hyperinflammatory state leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, known for its immunomodulatory properties. It has shown antiviral effect specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. METHODS: DAWn-AZITHRO is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID wards are eligible for study inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e., clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 h through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physician's discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. The primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. DISCUSSION: The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN consortium will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.

219726,Recurrent deep venous thromboses in a patient with adult-onset Still's disease,2021,"In the 21st century, an innovative method is the online medical integrated system. It has significant applications, such as reducing the expense of the healthcare system, enhancing the efficacy of the hospital management system, and improving the effectiveness of human capital. The online medical system can undoubtedly play a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, and it does as well. A road map of the secured acquisition of medical data from COVID-19 patients, encoding, and distribution to the cloud will be seen in this article. The major aim of this paper is to design a framework for protecting cloud medical data where resources are very limited. Blowfish and Elliptic-curve hybrid cryptographic techniques have been used for encryption. Using the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) method at the fog layer of the cloud, the encrypted data is then embedded into a stego-image format. For a stego-image, the distortion of the cover image must be left unnoticeable. The PSNR, MSE, and SSIM values are most important for maintaining this hiding capacity. The PSNR value differed from 53.08 to 60.36, while the MSE value varied from 0.06 to 0.31 with different data sizes with respect to different formats of the grayscale cover image. For all experimental conditions, the Structural Similarity Index Test (SSIM) values were 1. The proposed model with its stego image PSNR, MSE, and SSIM values has demonstrated that this proposed model can be a suitable substitute to secure medical data in cloud. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arfan, H.

220172,Innovations in COVID-19 testing: the road from pandemic response to control,2021,"Protein kinase MÎ¶ (PKMÎ¶) maintains long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory through persistent increases in kinase expression. Early-life adversity is a precursor to adult mood and anxiety disorders, in part, through persistent disruption of emotional memory throughout life. Here we subjected 10- to 16-wk-old male bonnet macaques to adversity by a maternal variable-foraging demand paradigm. We then examined PKMÎ¶ expression in their ventral hippocampi as 7- to 12-yr-old adults. Quantitative immunohistochemistry reveals decreased PKMÎ¶ in dentate gyrus, CA1, and subiculum of subjects who had experienced early-life adversity due to the unpredictability of maternal care. Adult animals with persistent decrements of PKMÎ¶ in ventral hippocampus express timid rather than confrontational responses to a human intruder. Persistent down-regulation of PKMÎ¶ in the ventral hippocampus might reduce the capacity for emotional memory maintenance and contribute to the long-lasting emotional effects of early-life adversity.","Fulton, Sasha L; Hsieh, Changchi; Atkin, Tobias; Norris, Ryan; Schoenfeld, Eric; Tsokas, Panayiotis; Fenton, André Antonio; Sacktor, Todd Charlton; Coplan, Jeremy D",Learn Mem,,98

225367,Rare case of Prevotella pleuritidis lung abscess,2020,"COVID-19, emerged at the end of 2019 have dramatically threatened the health, economy, and social mobility of people around the world and till date no medication is available for its treatment. An amazing herb, Nigella sativa, having antiviral, antihypertensive, anti- diarrhoeal, analgesics, and anti-bacterial properties, needs to be explored for its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In-silico studies were carried out to understand the role of its bioactive constituents in COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Firstly, the disease network was prepared by using ACE2 (Angiotensin-II receptor), as it is the entry site for virus. It was used to decipher the mechanism of SARS-COV-2 infection in humans. Second, the target receptors for N. sativa were predicted and protein interaction studies were conducted. Further, docking studies were also performed to analyse it for treatment purpose as well. This study concludes that pathways undertaken by N. sativa bioactive constituents were similar to the pathways followed in SARS-COV-2 pathology, like renin-angiotensin system, kidney functions, regulation of blood circulation, blood vessel diameter, etc. Also, in docking studies, the constituents of N. sativa, &#945;-hederin, Thymohydroquinone and Thymoquinone were observed to be efficiently binding to ACE2. Also, the bioactive phytoconstituents are involved in molecular pathways like HIF1, VEGF, IL-17, AGE-RAGE, chemokine and calcium signaling pathways which can be majorly helpful in combating hypoxia and inflammation caused due to compromised immune system and oxidative stress. Therefore, N. sativa standardized extract having the above phytoconstituents could be useful in COVID-19 and hence opens a new treatment line.","Jakhmola Mani, Ruchi; Sehgal, Nikita; Dogra, Nitu; Saxena, Shikha; Pande Katare, Deepshikha",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,98

METHODS: Non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted between 7 February and 12 February 2020 to Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, were included; clinical course through to 22 February was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1012 non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. Thirty (of 1012, 3.0%) individuals were asymptomatic on admission. During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic individuals developed different symptoms. Fourteen of 1012 patients (1.4%) remained asymptomatic from exposure to the end of follow up, with a median duration of 24 days (interquartile range 22-27). Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms. Small patchy opacities (355 of 917, 38.7%) and ground-glass opacities (508 of 917, 55.4%) were common imaging manifestations in chest CT scans. One hundred patients (9.9%) were transferred to designated hospitals due to aggravation of illness. Diarrhoea emerged in 152 of 1012 patients (15.0%). Male, older age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chills, dyspnoea, So2 value of &#8804;93%, white blood cell counts of >10 × 109/L and large consolidated opacities on CT images were all risk factors for aggravation of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Non-critically ill individuals had different clinical characteristics from critically ill individuals. Asymptomatic infections only accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19. Although with a low incidence, diarrhoea was observed in patients with COVID-19, indicating the possibility of faecal-oral transmission.","Wang, X; Fang, J; Zhu, Y; Chen, L; Ding, F; Zhou, R; Ge, L; Wang, F; Chen, Q; Zhang, Y; Zhao, Q",Clin. microbiol. infect,,98
227293,Addressing a rare cause of paediatric stridor: subglottic cyst,2020,"PURPOSE: Clinical characteristics and management of COVID-19 patients have evolved during the pandemic, potentially changing their outcomes. We analyzed the associations of changes in mortality rates with clinical profiles and respiratory support strategies in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at 126 Brazilian intensive care units between February 27th and October 28th, 2020. Assessing temporal changes in deaths, we identified distinct time periods. We evaluated the association of characteristics and respiratory support strategies with 60-day in-hospital mortality using random-effects multivariable Cox regression with inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Among the 13,301 confirmed-COVID-19 patients, 60-day in-hospital mortality was 13%. Across four time periods identified, younger patients were progressively more common, non-invasive respiratory support was increasingly used, and the 60-day in-hospital mortality decreased in the last two periods. 4188 patients received advanced respiratory support (non-invasive or invasive), from which 42% underwent only invasive mechanical ventilation, 37% only non-invasive respiratory support and 21% failed non-invasive support and were intubated. After adjusting for organ dysfunction scores and premorbid conditions, we found that younger age, absence of frailty and the use of non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) as first support strategy were independently associated with improved survival (hazard ratio for NIRS first [95% confidence interval], 0.59 [0.54-0.65], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Age and mortality rates have declined over the first 8 months of the pandemic. The use of NIRS as the first respiratory support measure was associated with survival, but causal inference is limited by the observational nature of our data.","Kurtz, Pedro; Bastos, Leonardo S L; Dantas, Leila F; Zampieri, Fernando G; Soares, Marcio; Hamacher, Silvio; Salluh, Jorge I F; Bozza, Fernando A",Intensive Care Med,,98

OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine the dissemination of this Miyara et al. study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes towards smoking occurred after its publication on April 21st, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14th and May 4th, 2020 by the Tweepy stream API, using a COVID-19 related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1,929 tweets were classified into three groups: 1) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study before it was published; 2) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study after it was published; 3) tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published. The tweets' attitudes towards smoking were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in statistical analysis software R. RESULTS: The temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al. study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than tweets not related to the Miyara et al. study either before (34.92%, P < 0.001) or after the Miyara et al. study was published (34.34%, P < 0.001).

Population health, not to mention planetary health, is suffering as a result. Nevertheless, the global health crisis in which we are embroiled has provided opportunities for effective collaboration, scientific innovation and real dialog around health and equity. Dr Amaylid Arteaga-García, director of Cuba's National Clinical Trials Coordinating Center (CENCEC), emphasized these opportunities when discussing Cuba's clinical trials in times of COVID-19. Founded in 1991 in response to the groundbreaking research emerging from the country's biopharmaceutical sector-including the first safe, effective vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease, VA-MENGOC-BC in 1989 and a recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B, Heberbiovac in 1990-CENCEC now coordinates some 100 clinical trials annually, many of them multi-site trials involving thousands of volunteers. Little did Dr Arteaga García know what problems lurked when she became CENCEC director in 2019. In February 2020, Cuba implemented its National COVID-19 Prevention & Control Plan. This included a scientific Innovation Committee tasked with evaluating promising projects, products and research that might be used in the health system to control and treat COVID-19.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) instructed people to take isolation measures and restrict their movement. Similarly, there was a gradual decrease in the number of visits to our emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVES: To describe the decline in the referrals to the ED and in-hospital beds occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it to the H1N1 2009 pandemic. METHODS: Employing a cross-sectional epidemiologic study, the pattern of visits to the ED during the COVID-19 was compared with the pattern of visits during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as well as a year without a pandemic. The data was adjusted to consider changes in population size. The Welch t test for unpaired, unequal samples was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Within 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the average number of visits to the ED dropped by 30.2% and the hospital occupancy by 29.2% (a minimum of 57%), compared to the same period, the year before. In comparison to the same period during the H1N1 outbreak, we witnessed a significant decline in the number of visits to the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: The behavior of people during the COVID-19 pandemic was different from their behavior during the H1N1 pandemic. People seemed to avoid visiting the ED. The boundary between precaution and panic in the generation of the media could be very thin. Decision-makers must take this into account.","Basis, Fuad; Zeidani, Hisam; Hussein, Khetam; Hareli, Shlomo",Int. j. health policy manag,,98

240498,Provider Satisfaction with Infectious Diseases Telemedicine Consults for Hospitalized Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The literature has reported a higher prevalence of negative clinical outcomes due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in obese individuals. This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (Î³Oz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the Î³Oz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Î³Oz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-Î³ in the adipose tissue. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar-fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar-fat diet + Î³Oz (HSF + Î³Oz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The Î³Oz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-Î³ gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. RESULTS: Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-Î³ underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The Î³Oz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-Î³ overexpression. CONCLUSION: Natural compounds as Î³Oz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.","Francisqueti-Ferron, Fabiane Valentini; Garcia, Jéssica Leite; Ferron, Artur Junio Togneri; Nakandakare-Maia, Erika Tiemi; Gregolin, Cristina Schmitt; Silva, Janaina Paixão das Chagas; Dos Santos, Klinsmann Carolo; Lo, Ângelo Thompson Colombo; Siqueira, Juliana Silva; de Mattei, Letícia; de Paula, Bruno Henrique; Sarzi, Felipe; Silva, Carol Cristina Vágula de Almeida; Moreto, Fernando; Costa, Mariane Róvero; Ferreira, Ana Lucia A; Minatel, Igor Otávio; Corrêa, Camila Renata",Mol Cell Endocrinol,,98

242183,The effect of real-time polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values on perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 and rapidly spread globally. Since there is still no specific treatment available, prevention of disease spread is crucial to manage the pandemic. Adequate public information is very important. To assess the optimal timing, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between web-based interest and new cases and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODS: Web-based interest for queries related to 'coronavirus' was assessed between 1 January and 19 June 2020, using Google Trends in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Reliability analysis of the used search terms was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. To investigate the association between web-based interest and new COVID-19 cases or deaths, the relative search volume was analysed for correlation with new cases and deaths. RESULTS: Reliability analysis revealed excellent reliability for COVID-19 search terms in all countries. Web-based interest peaked between 23 February and 5 April 2020, which was prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most included countries. There was a moderate to strong correlation between COVID-19 related queries and new cases or new deaths. CONCLUSION: Web-based interest in COVID-19 peaked prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most countries included. Thus, monitoring public interest via Google Trends might be useful to select the optimal-timing of web-based disease-specific information and preventive measures.","Schnoell, Julia; Besser, Gerold; Jank, Bernhard J; Bartosik, Tina J; Parzefall, Thomas; Riss, Dominik; Mueller, Christian A; Liu, David Tianxiang",Infect Dis (Lond),,98
242636,COVID-19 case management strategies: what are the options for Africa?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The shortage of blood products has become a worldwide problem, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Here, we investigated whether a point of care (POC) approach to perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) results could decrease perioperative blood loss and the perioperative consumption of blood products during lung transplantation. METHODS: Patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation were randomized into two groups: In the first group, designated the ""non POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy was based on the clinical experience of the anesthesiologist; in the second group, designated the ""POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding, and coagulopathy was based on the ROTEM results. RESULTS: After performing an interim statistical analysis, the project was prematurely terminated as the results were significantly in favor of the POC approach. Data were analyzed for the period January 2018 until June 2020 when 67 patients were recruited into the study. There was significantly decreased perioperative blood loss in the POC group (nâ¯=â¯31 patients) with pâ¯=â¯0.013, decreased perioperative consumption of RBC with pâ¯=â¯0.009, and decreased perioperative consumption of fresh frozen plasma with p < 0.0001 (practically no fresh frozen plasma was used in the POC group) without deteriorating clot formation in secondary and primary hemostasis as compared to the non POC group (nâ¯=â¯36). CONCLUSION: POC management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on ROTEM results is a promising strategy to decrease perioperative blood loss and the consumption of blood products in lung transplantation.","Durila, Miroslav; Vajter, Jaromir; Garaj, Michal; Pollert, Lukas; Berousek, Jan; Vachtenheim, Jiri; Vymazal, Tomas; Lischke, Robert",J. heart lung transplant,,98

246506,Covid-19 and children with immune thrombocytopenia: Emerging issues,2020,"With the availability of COVID-19-related clinical data, healthcare researchers can now explore the potential of computational technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to discover biomarkers for accurate detection, early diagnosis, and prognosis for the management of COVID-19. However, the identification of biomarkers associated with survival and deaths remains a major challenge for early prognosis. In the present study, we have evaluated and developed AI-based prediction algorithms for predicting a COVID-19 patient's survival or death based on a publicly available dataset consisting of clinical parameters and protein profile data of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients. The best classification model based on clinical parameters achieved a maximum accuracy of 89.47% for predicting survival or death of COVID-19 patients, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.71 and 92.45%, respectively. The classification model based on normalized protein expression values of 45 proteins achieved a maximum accuracy of 89.01% for predicting the survival or death, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.68 and 86%, respectively. Interestingly, we identified 9 clinical and 45 protein-based putative biomarkers associated with the survival/death of COVID-19 patients. Based on our findings, few clinical features and proteins correlate significantly with the literature and reaffirm their role in the COVID-19 disease progression at the molecular level. The machine learning-based models developed in the present study have the potential to predict the survival chances of COVID-19 positive patients in the early stages of the disease or at the time of hospitalization. However, this has to be verified on a larger cohort of patients before it can be put to actual clinical practice. We have also developed a webserver CovidPrognosis, where clinical information can be uploaded to predict the survival chances of a COVID-19 patient.

247215,Are surgical masks manufactured from sterilisation wrap safe?,2020,"The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the vaccines on social media. We adopt a human-guided machine learning framework using more than six million tweets from almost two million unique Twitter users to capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital, income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. People who have the worst personal pandemic experience are more likely to hold the anti-vaccine opinion. Next, by conducting counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform more effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.","Lyu, Hanjia; Wang, Junda; Wu, Wei; Duong, Viet; Zhang, Xiyang; Dye, Timothy D.; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02165v4.pdf,98

The aim of this rapid review is to describe the satisfaction, clinic productivity, clinical benefit, and costs associated with the virtual geriatric clinic model of care. METHODS: A rapid review of PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was conducted up to April 2020. Two independent reviewers extracted the information. Four subdomains were focused on: satisfaction with the virtual geriatric clinic, clinic productivity, clinical benefit to patients, costs and any challenges associated with the virtual clinic process. RESULTS: Nine studies with 975 patients met our inclusion criteria. All were observational studies. Seven studies reported patients were satisfied with the virtual geriatric clinic model of care. Productivity outcomes included reports of cost-effectiveness, savings on transport, and improved waiting list metrics. Clinical benefits included successful polypharmacy reviews, and reductions in acute hospitalisation rates. Varying challenges were reported for both clinicians and patients in eight of the nine studies. Hearing impairments and difficulty with technology added to anxieties experienced by patients. Physicians missed the added value of a thorough physical examination and had concerns about confidentiality. CONCLUSION: Virtual geriatric clinics demonstrate evidence of productivity, benefit to patients, cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction with the treatment provided. In the current suboptimal pandemic climate, virtual geriatric clinics may allow Geriatricians to continue to provide an outpatient service, despite the encountered inherent challenges.","Murphy, Robert P; Dennehy, Karen A; Costello, Maria M; Murphy, Evelyn P; Judge, Conor S; O039,; Donnell, Martin J; Canavan, Michelle D",Age Ageing,,98

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: After IRB approval, 112 patients were consecutively enrolled, having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalised in SIH. Patients' demographics and clinical data were retrieved from Radiology Information System (RIS). Chest radiographs (CXR) were retrieved from picture archive and communication system (PACS). CXR severity scoring was determined by three radiologists, and results were analysed. RESULTS: Lung opacities (98.2%), involvement of both lungs (96.4%), both peripheral and central region involvement (62.5%) and upper/mid/lower zone distribution (61.6%) were the most frequent findings. Males affected more than females with a mean age of 58.9 ± 13.1 years. Zonal involvement, density and extent of opacities peaked on 10-13th day of illness. In the last CXR, opacities showed decrease in extent as well as density, reduction in zonal involvement, and few having mixed interstitial thickening/fibrosis. One hundred and five out of 112 (93.8%) patients had residual radiographic abnormalities on discharge. CONCLUSION: Serial chest radiography can be used to monitor disease progression and temporal changes after initial HRCT. Patients who have CXR severity score of 4 or more at the time of admission, is a red flag for prolonged hospital stay and possible intubation. Severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-13 days. It is recommended to repeat CXRs every 3-4th day during hospital stay. Majority of the patients has residual radiographic abnormality on discharge.

The number of infections increases daily, without any approved antiviral therapy. The recently released viral nucleotide sequence enables the identification of therapeutic targets, e.g. by analyzing integrated human-virus metabolic models. Investigations of changed metabolic processes after virus infections and the effect of knock-outs on the host and the virus can reveal new potential targets. RESULTS: We generated an integrated host-virus genome-scale metabolic model of human alveolar macrophages and SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of stoichiometric and metabolic changes between uninfected and infected host cells using flux balance analysis (FBA) highlighted the different requirements of host and virus. Consequently, alterations in the metabolism can have different effects on host and virus, leading to potential antiviral targets. One of these potential targets is guanylate kinase (GK1). In FBA analyses, the knock-out of the GK1 decreased the growth of the virus to zero, while not affecting the host. As GK1 inhibitors are described in the literature, its potential therapeutic effect for SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to be verified in in-vitro experiments.

In particular, the manufacturing industry experienced a slowdown due to the sudden disruption in supply and demand. This situation stimulates the manufacturing industry to recover from this current challenging disruption. This study investigates the impact of supply chain integration on business performance through supply chain resilience, supply chain flexibility, and innovation system in Indonesia’s manufacturing companies. Data collection has obtained as many as 470 questionnaires considered valid for further analysis. Data analysis used the partial least square (PLS) technique using smartPLS software version 3.0. The results show that supply chain integration affects innovation system, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience because of its ability to share complete product information and share production planning. Innovation systems and supply chain flexibility enhance supply chain resilience through the ability to deal with sudden changes in customer demand and production problems. Supply chain integration improves business performance through innovation, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience in the COVID-19 era.

255094,Endobronchial tuberculosis polyps,2020,"Fractional calculus provides a promising tool for modeling fractional dynamics in computational biology, and this study tests the applicability of fractional-derivative equations (FDEs) for modeling the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the novel coronavirus for the first time. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the evolution dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed over the last three months (up to 3/22/2020) in China. The model results revealed that 1) the transmission, infection and recovery dynamics follow the integral-order SEIR model with significant spatiotemporal variations in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China, and 2) the evolution of number of deaths follows the time FDE, likely due to the time memory in the death toll. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. In addition, a time FDE model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the FDE model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread. Therefore, caution is needed when applying FDEs to model the coronavirus outbreak, since specific COVID-19 kinetics may not exhibit nonlocal behavior. Particularly, the spread of COVID-19 may be affected by the rapid improvement of health care systems which may remove the memory impact in COVID-19 dynamics (resulting in a short-tailed recovery curve), while the death toll and mitigation of COVID-19 can be captured by the time FDEs due to the nonlocal, memory impact in fatality and human activities.","Zhang, Yong; Yu, Xiangnan; Sun, HongGuang; Tick, Geoffrey R.; Wei, Wei; Jin, Bin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,98

The case study was used in this study conducted with seven science teachers. Data were collected through three scenarios developed about vaccination, curfew and distance education in the context of COVID-19. Within the context of the data obtained, the argument types of the teachers were evaluated through the deductive content analysis, and the supporting reasons they presented for their arguments were evaluated through the inductive content analysis. Study results showed that the science teachers offered more arguments, including a claim and the reasons supporting this claim and that the arguments where the pros and cons analysis was performed and the reasons for the different aspects of an issue are presented in detail could be presented less. In addition, although there were differences in the supporting reasons of the teachers according to the content of the scenario, these reasons were concentrated on the subject areas of health, social, value and personal experience. The findings can contribute to improving the science teachers' argumentation qualifications and increasing the quality of in-class argumentation practices.","Atabey, Nejla",International Journal of Psychology and Educational Studies,,98

260413,International heterogeneity in coronavirus disease 2019 pediatric mortality rates,2021,"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 has been felt worldwide, yet we are still unsure about its full impact. One of the gaps in our current knowledge relates to the long-term mental and physical impact of the infection on affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the Netherlands at the end of February 2020, resulting in over 900,000 people testing positive for the virus, over 24,000 hospitalizations, and over 13,000 deaths by the end of January 2021. Although many patients recover from the acute phase of the disease, experience with other virus outbreaks has raised concerns regarding possible late sequelae of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an online tool to assess the long-term burden of COVID-19 in patients. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of development, assessment, programming, implementation, and use of this new tool: the assessment of burden of COVID-19 (ABCoV) tool. This new tool is based on the well-validated assessment of burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool. RESULTS: As of January 2021, the new ABCoV tool has been used in an online patient platform by more than 2100 self-registered patients and another 400 patients in a hospital setting, resulting in over 2500 patients. These patients have submitted the ABCoV questionnaire 3926 times. Among the self-registered patients who agreed to have their data analyzed (n=1898), the number of females was high (n=1153, 60.7%), many were medically diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=892, 47.0%), and many were relatively young with only 7.4% (n=141) being older than 60 years. Of all patients that actually used the tool (n=1517), almost one-quarter (n=356, 23.5%) used the tool twice, and only a small group (n=76, 5.0%) used the tool 6 times. CONCLUSIONS: This new ABCoV tool has been broadly and repeatedly used, and may provide insight into the perceived burden of disease, provide direction for personalized aftercare for people post COVID-19, and help us to be prepared for possible future recurrences.","van Noort, Esther M J; Claessens, Danny; Moor, Catharina C; Berg, Carlijn A L Van Den; Kasteleyn, Marise J; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M; Van Schayck, Onno C P; Chavannes, Niels H",JMIR Form Res,,98
261647,More than a scratch: emergency setting eye evaluation during COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Background: Previous studies have shown that curcumin derivatives can improve the fatty degeneration of liver tissue that occurs in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the specific mechanism for that improvement remains unclear. We examined whether the curcumin derivative galangin could reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue in mice with NAFLD by inducing autophagy, from the perspective of both prevention and treatment. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a prevention group (given galangin and a HFD simultaneously) or a treatment group (given galangin after being fed an HFD). The prevention group was treated with galangin (100 mg/kg/d) or an equal volume of normal saline (NS) while being fed an HFD. Some mice were treated with an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA; 30 mg/kg/biwk, i.p.) while being fed an HFD and galangin. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing both free fatty acids and galangin. Results: Galangin was found to reduce the fatty degeneration of liver tissue induced by eating an HFD at both the prevention and treatment levels, and that effect might be related to an enhancement of hepatocyte autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA blocked the protective effect of galangin on hepatic steatosis. At the cellular level, galangin reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced the level of hepatocyte autophagy. Conclusion: In vitro and in vivo studies showed that galangin cannot only improve pre-existing hepatic steatosis but also prevent the development of stenosis by promoting hepatocyte autophagy.","Zhang, Xinxu; Deng, Yuanyuan; Xiang, Juan; Liu, Huixia; Zhang, Jiani; Liao, Jie; Chen, Ke; Liu, Bo; Liu, Jun; Pu, Ying",Drug Des Devel Ther,,98

266930,Associations Between Genetically Predicted Protein Levels and COVID-19 Severity,2021,"(1) Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began spreading across the globe in December and, as of 9 July 2020, had inflicted more than 550,000 deaths. Public health measures implemented to control the outbreak caused socio-economic havoc in many countries. The pandemic highlighted the quality of health care systems, responses of policymakers in harmony with the population, and socio-economic resilience factors. We suggest that different national strategies had an impact on mortality and case count. (2) Methods: We collected fatality data for 17 countries until 2 June 2020 from public data and associated these with implemented containment measures. (3) Results: The outcomes present the effectiveness of control mechanisms in mitigating the virus for selected countries and the UAE as a special case. Pre-existing conditions defined the needed public health strategies and fatality numbers. Other pre-existing conditions, such as temperature, humidity, median age, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations played minor roles and may have had no direct impact on fatality rates. (4) Conclusions: Prevention, fast containment, adequate public health strategies, and importance of indoor environments were determining factors in mitigating the pandemic. Development of public health strategies adapted to pre-existing conditions for each country and community compliance with implemented policies ensure the successful control of pandemics.","Haj Bloukh, Samir; Edis, Zehra; Shaikh, Annis A; Pathan, Habib M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,98
267104,Concurrent COVID-19 and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in a severely immunocompromised 25-year-old patient,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak, designated a ""pandemic"" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, has spread worldwide rapidly. Each country implemented prevention and control strategies, mainly classified as SARS LCS (SARS-like containment strategy) or PAIN LMS (pandemic influenza-like mitigation strategy). The reasons for variation in each strategy's efficacy in controlling COVID-19 epidemics were unclear and are investigated in this paper. On the basis of the daily number of confirmed local (imported) cases and onset-to-confirmation distributions for local cases, we initially estimated the daily number of local (imported) illness onsets by a deconvolution method for mainland China, South Korea, Japan and Spain, and then estimated the effective reproduction numbers Rt by using a Bayesian method for each of the four countries. China and South Korea adopted a strict SARS LCS, to completely block the spread via lockdown, strict travel restrictions and by detection and isolation of patients, which led to persistent declines in effective reproduction numbers. In contrast, Japan and Spain adopted a typical PAIN LMS to mitigate the spread via maintaining social distance, self-quarantine and isolation etc., which reduced the Rt values but with oscillations around 1. The finding suggests that governments may need to consider multiple factors such as quantities of medical resources, the likely extent of the public's compliance to different intensities of intervention measures, and the economic situation to design the most appropriate policies to fight COVID-19 epidemics.","Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yanni; Liu, Pei Yu; Cheke, Robert A; Li, Xuan Ya",Math Biosci Eng,,98

Their decay rate is vanishingly small in the thermodynamic limit, i.e. when the spontaneous emission noise $\beta$-factor tends to zero. We provide experimental evidence of mesoscopic limit cycles $-$with $\sim 10^3$ intracavity photons$-$ through photon statistics measurements. We first show that the order parameter quantifying the limit cycle amplitude can be reconstructed from the mode intensity statistics. As a main result we observe a maximum of the averaged amplitude at the mode switching, accounting for limit cycle oscillations. We finally relate this maximum to a dip of mode cross-correlations, reaching a minimum of $g_{ij}^{(2)}=2/3$, which we show to be a mesoscopic limit. Coupled nanolasers are thus an appealing testbed for the investigation of spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in presence of strong quantum fluctuations.","Marconi, Mathias; Raineri, Fabrice; Levenson, Ariel; Yacomotti, Alejandro M.; Javaloyes, Julien; Pan, Si H.; Amili, Abdelkrim El; Fainman, Yeshaiahu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10830v1.pdf,98

However, studies indicate significant rates of vaccine hesitancy among them and, therefore, of acceptance of vaccination recommendations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in Southern Italy to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCP about VPDs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimate their intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and search for determinants that may influence their choice. A self-administered questionnaire was used. HCP improved their knowledge about VPDs and were more favorable to vaccinations in September-December 2020 compared to January-December 2019. Overall, 75% of respondents would get a COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings indicate a potential role of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Italian HCP's knowledge and attitudes towards vaccines.","Ledda, Caterina; Costantino, Claudio; Cuccia, Mario; Maltezou, Helena C; Rapisarda, Venerando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,98

Here, we have utilised RNA-seq to define cellular pathways regulated by ILRUN in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of Caco-2 cells. We find that inhibition of ILRUN expression by RNA interference alters transcription profile of numerous cellular pathways, including upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and several other members of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. In addition, transcripts of the SARS-CoV-2 co-receptors TMPRSS2 and CTSL were also upregulated. Inhibition of ILRUN also resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, while overexpression of ILRUN had the opposite effect, identifying ILRUN as a novel antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents, to our knowledge, the first report of ILRUN as a regulator of the RAAS.IMPORTANCEThere is no doubt that the current rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had significant and far-reaching impacts on our health and economy and will continue to do so. Research in emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is growing rapidly, with new breakthroughs in the understanding of host-virus interactions in order to assist with the development of innovative and exciting therapeutic strategies. Here we present the first evidence that modulation of the human protein-encoding gene ILRUN functions as an antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, likely through its newly identified role in regulating the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. These data improve our understanding of biological pathways that regulate host factors critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the development of antiviral strategies to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Tribolet, Leon; Alexander, Marina R; Brice, Aaron M; van Vuren, Petrus Jansen; Rootes, Christina L; Mara, Kostlend; McDonald, Meg; Bruce, Kerri L; Gough, Tamara J; Shi, Shuning; Cowled, Christopher; Bean, Andrew G D; Stewart, Cameron R",J. virol,,98

This study was designed to investigate the effects of Liuzijue exercise on the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Thirty three eligible patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study after discharge. All the participants practiced Liuzijue exercise once per day for 20 minutes over 4âweeks. Data were collected at baseline and the end of the intervention. Primary outcomes involved functional capacity and secondary outcomes involved quality of life. RESULTS: The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), and diaphragm movement in deep breathing (DM-DB) of patients increased significantly after 4âweeks of intervention. The dyspnea was also alleviated and exercise capacity was significantly improved. In terms of quality of life, physical functioning and role-physical scores were significantly increased. Moreover, Liuzijue could significantly alleviate the depression and anxiety status of the patients. CONCLUSION: Liuzijue exercise is a viable alternative home exercise program that produced better functional capacity and quality of life in discharged patients with COVID-19. These findings also showed the necessity of rehabilitation intervention for cured COVID-19 patients.","Tang, Yunliang; Jiang, Jian; Shen, Peng; Li, Moyi; You, Huangjun; Liu, Chongchong; Chen, Liwei; Wang, Ziwen; Zhou, Congyang; Feng, Zhen",Medicine (Baltimore),,98

272957,Bouveret syndrome: a clinicoradiological perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Rapid and effective emergency response to address health security relies on a competent and suitably trained local and international workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the health security workforce needs to be well equipped to tackle current and future challenges. In this study, we explored whether training in applied epidemiology was meeting the current needs of the applied epidemiology workforce. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was available in English and French. We used purposive and snowballing sampling techniques to identify potential survey respondents. An online social media advertisement campaign was used to disseminate a REDCap survey link between October 2019 and February 2020 through field epidemiology networks. Survey questions included demographic details of participants, along with their technical background, level of formal education, topics studied during epidemiology training, and years of experience as an epidemiologist. We used Pearson Chi-squared (Chi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to test the difference between categorical variables, and content analysis to evaluate responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: In total, 282 people responded to the survey. Participants had a range of formal public health and epidemiology training backgrounds. Respondents applied epidemiology experience spanned almost 30 years, across 64 countries. Overall, 74% (n = 210) were alumni of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). Basic outbreak and surveillance training was well reported by respondents, however training in specialised techniques related to emergency response, communication, and leadership was less common. FETP graduates reported higher levels of formal training in all survey topics. CONCLUSION: It is critical for the health security workforce to be well-trained and equipped with skills needed to ensure a rapid and effective response to acute public health events. Leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and specialist training in emergency response are lacking in current training models. Our study has demonstrated that applied epidemiology workforce training must evolve to remain relevant to current and future public health challenges.","Parry, A. E.; Kirk, M. D.; Durrheim, D.

273038,Systematic testing for influenza and COVID-19 among patients with respiratory illness,2020,"One of the main modes of transmission and propagation of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the direct contact with respiratory droplets transmitted among individuals at a certain distance. There are indoor spaces, such as dwellings, in which the transmission risk is high. This research aims to record and analyze risk close contacts in this scope, experimentally assessing the effectiveness of using electronic proximity warning sound devices or systems. For this purpose, the methodology is based on monitoring the location of the occupants of a dwelling. Then, the days in which a proximity warning sound system is installed and activated are compared to the days in which the system is not activated. The results stressed the significant reduction of time and number of close contacts among individuals when the warning was activated. Regarding the relation between the number and the duration of close contacts, together with the reductions mentioned, the possibility of making certain predictions based on the distributions obtained is proved. All this contributes to the progress in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission because of close contacts in dwellings.","Marín-García, David; Moyano-Campos, Juan J; Bienvenido-Huertas, J David",Indoor air,,98

274280,COVID-19: First data from Africa,2020,"Early identification of severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very important for individual treatment. We included 203 patients with COVID-19 by propensity score matching in this retrospective, case-control study. The effects of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at admission on patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. We found that serum LDH levels had a 58.7% sensitivity and 82.0% specificity, based on a best cut-off of 277.00 U/L, for predicting severe COVID-19. And a cut-off of 359.50 U/L of the serum LDH levels resulted in a 93.8% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity for predicting death of COVID-19. Additionally, logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model respectively indicated that elevated LDH level was an independent risk factor for the severity (HR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.25-5.97; P=0.012) and mortality (HR: 40.50, 95% CI: 3.65-449.28; P=0.003) of COVID-19. Therefore, elevated LDH level at admission is an independent risk factor for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. LDH can assist in the early evaluating of COVID-19. Clinicians should pay attention to the serum LDH level at admission for patients with COVID-19.","Li, Chang; Ye, Jianfang; Chen, Qijian; Hu, Weihua; Wang, Lingling; Fan, Yameng; Lu, Zhanjin; Chen, Jie; Chen, Zaishu; Chen, Shiyan; Tong, Junlu; Xiao, Wei; Mei, Jin; Lu, Hongyun",Aging (Albany NY),,98
274663,HIV in the age of COVID-19,2021,"Drawing from thematic analysis of qualitative data from 27 in-depth interviews with cisgender women street-based sex workers recruited through snowball sampling in Uyo, Nigeria, this article explores structural inequities, HIV vulnerability and women's agency. Structural and gendered inequities influenced women's decision to enter street-based sex work and created conditions that facilitated substance use and increased vulnerability to violence, unprotected sex and HIV transmission. Although women's agency and creative negotiation of structural forces offered possibilities for increased choices, their routine coping strategies ultimately posed as sources of risks. Women's socio-legal position constrained their choices, and this highlights how structural vulnerability is embodied as everyday survival strategies that shape exposure to harm and poor health. Findings indicate a need for policy shift towards decriminalisation of sex work and structural HIV interventions, economic empowerment measures to alleviate poverty and substance use treatment and trauma management services to improve the health and well-being of women involved in street-based sex work.","Nelson, Ediomo-Ubong Ekpo",Glob Public Health,,98
274664,HIV in the age of COVID-19,2021,"This study analyzes global health consequences of the new coronavirus disease by focusing on the roles of normative beliefs on social distancing and country-level factors, i.e., mobility estimate and globalization index. We fitted mixed effects models to examine the associations between two outcome measures, depression and self-rated health, and their multilevel determinants using a subset of Global Behaviors and Perceptions in the COVID-19 Pandemic, an online survey consisting of more than 100,000 participants from 67 nations. Results show that both personal beliefs and general beliefs significantly predict depression and poor health. There is also a contextual effect of globalization on depression. In addition, the relationship between general beliefs and depression is stronger in countries with lower rates of mobility. With respect to poor health, the effect of general beliefs similarly varies inversely with the level of globalization. Our study indicates that one's own beliefs and the perception of others' regarding social distancing, along with contextual factors (measures of mobility and globalization), critically shape mental and physical health. Subjective and objective factors should be considered, in other words, in properly understanding the differential impact of COVID-19 across the world.","Kim, Harris Hyun-Soo; Ryu, Jia",Prev Med,,98

The priority for all radiation oncology departments is to protect the staff and to maintain operations in providing access to those patients requiring radiation therapy services. Patients with tumors of the aerodigestive tract and pelvis amongst others often experience toxicity during treatment, and there is a baseline risk that adverse effects may require hospital-based management. Routine care during weekly visits is important to guide patients through treatment and to mitigate against the need for hospitalization. Nevertheless, hospitalizations occur and there is a risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread. During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical resources used to help manage patients, such as dental services, interventional radiology, rehabilitation and others are limited or not at all available. Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients.

METHODS: Information on COVID-19 clusters (n &#8805;2), and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 was collected. RESULTS: A total of 381 clusters with 3786 infected cases were collected, accounting for 23.9% of 15 852 cumulated cases on 9 May 2020. Although the cluster number (/107 subjects) in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly smaller compared with those in the other two groups, the cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly larger than that in non-medical/welfare facilities. Cluster numbers in general medical/welfare facilities and in non-medical/welfare facilities were significantly positively correlated with morbidity (/105 ), indicating relatively early identification of clusters in these facilities. Unlike in these facilities, cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly positively correlated with morbidity, indicating that clusters in LTC hospitals/facilities were finally identified after already having grown to a large size in areas where infection was prevalent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both cluster number and cluster size only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently associated with higher mortality (&#8805;median 0.64/105 subjects) after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive efforts against COVID-19 outbreaks even at the early phase of the epidemic are critically important in LTC hospitals/facilities, as both the larger number and size of clusters only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently linked to higher mortality in prefectures in Japan.

276512,What reinfections mean for COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on healthcare system globally. Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice. METHODS: Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when > 70% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or > 80% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square (&#967;2) test (p < 0·05 was considered as unstable). RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16-24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

AIMS: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86-97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59-76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34-68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.1%).

This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.","Maykrantz, Sherry A; Gong, Tao; Petrolino, Ashley V; Nobiling, Brandye D; Houghton, Jeffery D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,98

Hence, this evaluation was undertaken to have protocols based on robust recommendations and guidelines to be followed while handling the potentially infective samples in the clinical laboratories in order to ensure safety of the staff. However, these recommendations are based on the limited and rapidly evolving knowledge available at the moment and hence need to be reviewed periodically.","Misra, Pratibha; Bhatia, Kapil; Negi, Rakhi; Mukherjee, Bhasker; Sibin, Mk",J.

287560,Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays Reverted to Positive in 25 Discharged Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is limited current knowledge on feasibility and safety of kidney transplantation in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) survivors. METHODS: We present a retrospective cohort study of 75 kidney transplants in patients who recovered from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 performed across 22 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020, to January 31, 2021. We detail demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR tests, normal chest imaging with complete resolution of symptom for at least 28 d and significant social distancing for 14 d before surgery. RESULTS: Clinical severity in patients ranged from asymptomatic (n = 17, 22.7%), mild (n = 36.48%), moderate (n = 15.20%), and severe (n = 7.9.3%) disease. Median duration between PCR positive to transplant was 60 d (overall) and increased significantly from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe disease (49, 57, 83, 94 d, P 0.019), respectively.

287565,Estimating effects of intervention measures on COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan taking account of improving diagnostic capabilities using a modelling approach,2021,"The pandemic Covid-19 is responsible for a major education crisis globally and has a drastic impact on medical training as well. The objective of the present study was to envision the present and future impact of Covid-19 on anatomy learning and research. The virtual education is the only mode of teaching in current scenario. Every anatomist is unlocking technology to deliver best education however understanding of the subject without dissections or other practical teaching aids like bones, specimens, embryology models, microscopic slides etc. is challenging. This approach misses the feel and human visual impacts. Potential educational disruption is felt currently and will be experienced even after the pandemic is over due to scarcity of cadavers. As the body donor may be carrier or died of Covid-19 and there is no proven screening to rule out this infection in donor, so the acceptance of body donations is not advisable for the safety of medical students and health care workers. To conclude, anatomy education is cadaverless currently due to Covid-19 lockdown and it is prophesied that after the pandemic, real cadavers will be replaced by virtual cadavers because of paucity of cadavers. Research in the field of anatomy will also be adversely affected.","Singal, A; Bansal, A; Chaudhary, P",Morphologie,,98

288573,The COVID-19 pandemic preparedness simulation tool: CovidSIM,2020,"Purpose: The present study was undertaken to investigate epidemiological distribution, clinical manifestation, co morbid status, treatment strategy and case fatality index of emerging COVID-19 infection at SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan. It also evaluated efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treatment of patients and risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in relation to their co morbid status. Materials and methods: In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken on 522 patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at SMS Medical College and Attached Hospitals, Jaipur. The indoor admitted patient's information inclusive of demographic profile (age, sex, nationality, residence), date of confirmation for positive COVID-19 case, travel/ exposure history, date of recovery/ death, clinical features, co morbidities and treatment plan was recorded. A serial follow-up of recovered patients to evaluate infective period of the disease was also part of the study. Results: A total of 522 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adult in the age group with mean age of 35.42 years. 22.41% patients were below 20 years of age, majority of patients (58.80%) were in the age range of 21 to 50 years and only 18.79% patient population was in the age range of above 50 years. Females (39.08%) were affected less than males (60.91%) with an average sex ratio of female: male being 0.64. Out of the total analyzed patients, only 24.32% patients were symptomatic, among them fever (55.90%), cough (52.75%), sore throat (49.60%) and shortness of breath (46.45%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations while a few patients also had symptoms of headache (26.77%), chest pain (6.29%) and other symptoms (7.87%) like pain abdomen, fatigue, joints pain, altered sensorium etc. Most of symptomatic patients belonging to older age group. An average of 40.40% patient population of above 50 years of age, were symptomatic while none of the patients below 10 years of age were symptomatic. 13.98% patients had some or the other underlying co morbid disease. The most prevalent co morbidity was hypertension (42.46%) followed by Diabetes mellitus (39.72%), Old k-chest (20.54%), COPD/ Bronchial Asthma (16.43%), Coronary artery disease (13.69%), Chronic kidney disease (13.69%) and Valvular heart disease (6.84%) distributed in co morbid patients of COVID-19. 60.27% of patient population with underlying co morbid conditions were more prone to develop symptomatology complex as compared to that observed in patients with no co morbidity (18.42%). 116 patients had recovered with effective treatment till the date of data analysis. Time of recovery was counted from the date of positive report to 1st negative report of oropharyngeal sample by RT-PCR for COVID-19 with an average recovery time of 8.15 days. 23.27% patients recovered within 5 days, while 52.58% patients took about 6-10 days, 23.27% patients took 11-15 days and remaining 0.86% took more than 16 days to recover. In the present study 15 patients had died till analysis of data, among the deceased, 73.33% were above 50 year of age with a male preponderance (66.6%). Interestingly, all deceased (100%) had presented with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and all had underlying multiple co morbid conditions. Majority of patients had early mortality after admission to hospital with two third death account in initial three days. Asymptomatic patients (cases) treated with HCQ recovered early (average recovery time =5.4 days) compared to asymptomatic patients who did not receive any treatment (control group) and had longer recovery time (average recovery time =7.6 days). Conclusion: The varied spectra of COVID-19 mostly affects young adult age group (third to fifth decades of life). Interestingly, early age group was also affected in significant proportion when compared with similar data from other countries. It was observed that male population seemed to be was more prone to getting infected. Majority of COVID-19 positive patients (nearly three-fourth) were asymptomatic (mostly in young age range) at the time of diagnosis, which poses a major challenge for health care workers. Fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath were major symptoms that could be detected in such COVID-19 patients. Symptomatic clinical manifestations were more common in old age population. Infectivity was higher in patients that had underlying co morbid disease, especially in patients with multiple co morbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease. Average recovery time from COVID-19 was 8 days with effective treatment. Mortality in COVID-19 was higher in old age population, male gender, symptomatic and co morbid patients as compared to other similarly matched group. Most of mortality was noted within first few days of admission, suggestive of early mortality due to the primary disease process. Treatment with HCQ had early recovery without effectively influencing the overall mortality.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Singh, Ajeet; Sharma, Raman; Rankawat, Govind; Banerjee, S; Gupta, Vishal; Dube, Amitabh; Kakkar, Shivankan; Sharma, Shrikant; Keswani, Prakash; Agrawal, Abhishek; Tak, Amit; Nawal, C L",J Assoc Physicians India,,98
288760,Encouraging outcomes of solid organ recipients with covid-19,2020,"Purpose of this reportThe purpose of this rapid communication is to illustrate the effectiveness of different vaccination regimes for controlling the number of severe and critical COVID-19 cases in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany. Our results show that, despite numerous vaccinations in the past, further vaccinations are necessary to immunize the population and to keep the number of severe and critical cases low in the coming months. Considering that not all people can or want to receive vaccination, we compare different age-specific vaccination approaches. Applied MethodsWe use the agent-based epidemiological simulator Covasim for discussing the impact of different vaccination strategies. We calibrate it to reproduce the historical course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany; for this, we model and integrate numerous public health interventions imposed on the local population. As for some of the political actions rigorous quantification is currently not available, we fit those unknown (free) model parameters to published data on the measured epidemiological dynamics. Then we calculate the state of immunization of the population, gained through infections and vaccinations, at any time in the past, including models for time-dependent immunity decay that have been made available in Covasim. Finally, we define and compare scenarios of different vaccination regimes, especially with regard to vaccinating adolescents and providing booster vaccinations to the elderly. Key messageWithout further vaccinations, we expect a strong increase in severe and critical cases. In order to restrict their growth our simulations suggest that in all considered cases vaccinations of unvaccinated people is more effective than booster vaccinations for already fully vaccinated people. This applies even to vaccinations of young people who are not themselves at high risk of developing severe or critical illness. We attribute this observation to the fact that immunization of adolescents indirectly protects vulnerable age groups by preventing the spread of the virus more effectively than further immunizing other age groups. This indicates that with the pandemic ongoing, strategies focussed on minimizing individual health risks by vaccinations may no longer coincide with those needed to minimize the number of severe and critical cases.","Krebs, Tobias; Jouanne-Diedrich, Holger von; Moeckel, Michael J",,,98

As psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general population and university students go unnoticed. This review aims to present existing literature that reports the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and university students in different countries. Methods: A manual search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar and Mendeley from inception to 31st January 2021. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: During COVID-19 pandemic, relatively high rates of depression (4.5% to 72.3%), anxiety (12.7% to 85.7%) and stress (5% to 90.1%) were reported in the general population as well as in university students, depression (3% to 70.5%), anxiety (9% to 63.3%) and stress (61.5% to 25%) in India, Nepal, Pakistan, China, Spain, US, UK, France, Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Risk factors associated include female gender, younger age group (<40 years), unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and stress.

291518,Impact of lockdown on bed occupancy rate in a referral hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in northeast Brazil,2020,"The extraterritoriality doctrine of the Commerce Clause forbids a state from regulating activities wholly outside of its borders. There are three primary criticisms of the doctrine: first, that any ""dormant"" or ""negative"" component of the Commerce Clause is not supported by the text, structure, or history of the Constitution;second, that to recognize a specific ban on extraterritorial legislation is to misread core Commerce Clause cases;and third, that, even if there is a sound basis for a ban on extraterritorial legislation, such a prohibition is no longer needed because in today's modern economy regulated entities can comply easily with diverse state regulations. Despite these textual, jurisprudential, and practical criticisms, courts continue to invoke the doctrine to restrict the traditional police powers of the state. Recently, courts used the doctrine to block Maryland from ensuring that live-saving prescription drugs are affordable and New York from requiring that opioid manufacturers contribute to a fund for addiction treatment. To make matters worse, the courts' use of the doctrine is inconsistent, if not incoherent. Indeed, there are three live circuit splits on the existence and meaning of the doctrine. A new model is needed. This Article proposes that the extraterritoriality doctrine be collapsed into a Due Process inquiry. Doing so will give courts a familiar availment standard to deploy, will restore the authority of the states to set the terms of access to their market, and will respect the ability of market actors to weigh whether the proposed terms are worth the prospects of market entry. This Article offers this model as a reasoned and workable alternative to the current extraterritoriality framework, outlining its theoretical basis and applying it to recent circuit court cases as well as to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

291519,Impact of lockdown on bed occupancy rate in a referral hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in northeast Brazil,2020,"Despite the rapid growth of online shopping and research interest in the relationship between online and in-store shopping, national-level modeling and investigation of the demand for online shopping with a prediction focus remain limited in the literature. This paper differs from prior work and leverages two recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for 2009 and 2017 to develop machine learning (ML) models, specifically gradient boosting machine (GBM), for predicting household-level online shopping purchases. The NHTS data allow for not only conducting nationwide investigation but also at the level of households, which is more appropriate than at the individual level given the connected consumption and shopping needs of members in a household. We follow a systematic procedure for model development including employing Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to select input variables (features) in order to reduce the risk of model overfitting and increase model explainability. Extensive post-modeling investigation is conducted in a comparative manner between 2009 and 2017, including quantifying the importance of each input variable in predicting online shopping demand, and characterizing value-dependent relationships between demand and the input variables. In doing so, two latest advances in machine learning techniques, namely Shapley value-based feature importance and Accumulated Local Effects plots, are adopted to overcome inherent drawbacks of the popular techniques in current ML modeling. The modeling and investigation are performed both at the national level and for three of the largest cities (New York, Los Angeles, and Houston). The models developed and insights gained can be used for online shopping-related freight demand generation and may also be considered for evaluating the potential impact of relevant policies on online shopping demand.","Barua, Limon; Zou, Bo; Zhou, Yan; Liu, Yulin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03690v1.pdf,98

CASE PRESENTATION: A 78 years old woman was admitted to the Emergency Unit with respiratory symptoms, confusion and cyanosis at the extremity, in particular at the nose area, hands and feet fingers. A nasal swab for COVID-19 was performed, which resulted positive, and so therapy with doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents was started. At admission, the patient was hemodynamically unstable requiring circulatory support with liquids and norepinephrine; laboratory tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During hospitalization, the clinical condition worsened and the cyanosis of the nose, fingers, and toes rapidly increased and became dried gangrene in three days. Subsequently, the neurological state deteriorated into a coma and the patient died. DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 could be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. This case report shows the quick development of dried gangrene in a non-vasculopathic patient, as a consequence of COVID-19's coagulopathy and DIC.

It was found that career growth opportunities improved career commitment and reduced career regret via its boosting effect on employee thriving at work. The survey results also showed that the impact of career growth opportunities on thriving (directly), and on career commitment and career regret (indirectly), is heightened by employee anxiety triggered by COVID-19. This indicates that career growth opportunities are most needed and most beneficial for shaping employees’ career outcomes when they experience high levels of COVID-19 anxiety.","Huo, Meng-Long",Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,,98

299091,COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Focus on immunosuppression management,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is generally diagnosed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or serological assays. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreases a few days after symptom onset. Thus, the RT-PCR sensitivity peaks at three days after symptom onset (approximately 80%). We evaluated the performance of the ARCHITECT® SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (henceforth termed IgG assay; Abbott Laboratories, Lake County, IL, USA), and the combination of RT-PCR and the IgG assay for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: In this retrospective study, 206 samples from 70 COVID-19 cases at two hospitals in Tokyo that were positive using RT-PCR were used to analyze the diagnostic sensitivity. RT-PCR-negative (N=166), COVID-19-unrelated (N=418), and Japanese Red Cross Society (N=100) samples were used to evaluate specificity. Results: Sensitivity increased daily after symptom onset and exceeded 84.4% after 10 days. Specificity ranged from 98.2% to 100% for samples from the three case groups. Seroconversion was confirmed from 9 to 20 days after symptom onset in 18 out of 32 COVID-19 cases with multiple samples and from another case with a positive result in the IgG assay for the first available sample. Conclusions: The combination of RT-PCR and IgG assay improves the robustness of laboratory diagnostics by compensating for the limitations of each method.","Aoki, Kotaro; Takai, Kunitomo; Nagasawa, Tatsuya; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Mori, Nobuaki; Matsubayashi, Keiji; Satake, Masahiro; Tanaka, Ippei; Kodama, Nanae; Shimodaira, Takahiro; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Miyazaki, Taito; Ishii, Toshiaki; Morita, Toshisuke; Yoshimura, Toru; Tateda, Kazuhiro",Ann Lab Med,,98

301370,From China: hope and lessons for COVID-19 control,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest communicable disease outbreak to have hit Malaysia since the 1918 Spanish Flu which killed 34,644 people or 1% of the population of the then British Malaya. In 1999, the Nipah virus outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100 Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO.","Hashim, Jamal Hisham; Adman, Mohammad Adam; Hashim, Zailina; Mohd Radi, Mohd Firdaus; Kwan, Soo Chen",Front Public Health,,98

Considerando-se que, para o delineamento de medidas profiláticas adequadas ao controle de uma doença é necessário o conhecimento de suas causas, o presente trabalho teve por objetivo estudar de modo longitudinal a freqüência de ocorrência de coronavírus bovino (BCoV), rotavírus do grupo A (RV-A), protozoários, helmintos e enterobactérias em uma propriedade com casos esporádicos e em outra com casos recorrentes de diarréia em bezerros. Investigou-se, ainda, a presença de genes codificadores de para as toxinas shiga-like 1 e 2 , para as adesinas K99 e F41 e para a intimina (eae) nas E. coli isoladas. Para a detecção de BCoV, utilizou-se uma nested-RT-PCR direcionada ao gene codificador da RNA polimerase RNA dependente, e para a detecção de RV-A utilizou-se ELISA direto duplo sanduíche. O isolamento e caracterização bioquímica das colônias de bactérias foram conduzidos de acordo com técnicas de bacteriologia clássica. A caracterização genotípica das colônias de E. coli isoladas foi realizada através de uma Multiplex-PCR, utilizando primers para os genes codificadores dos seguintes fatores de virulência: Stx1, Stx2, Sta, K99, F41 e eae. A detecção de parasitas foi realizada por centrífugo sedimentação em água-eter e centrífugo-flutuação em solução supersaturada de sacarose, considerando-se como resultado final do exame coproparasitológico todos os parasitas encontrados em ambas as técnicas em sua maior contagem. A freqüência de ocorrência de coronavírus bovino e rotavírus do grupo A foi baixa, restrita a animais com até quatro meses de idade, enquanto que protozoários, helmintos e enterobactérias apresentaram tendência crescente em freqüência relacionada à progressão da idade dos animais. Foram identificados os patotipos STEC, AEEC e um padrão atípico com os genes de K99 e eae.

O presente trabalho colabora para a caracterização da microbiota entérica de bezerros, mas mantém abertas as questões relativas às diferenças específicas entre as biotas entéricas de bezerros sadios e com diarréia, enfatizando a importância de se realizarem mais estudos que investiguem simultaneamente diversos enteropatógenos potenciais nestes animais","Razera, Giselle Ayres",,,98
301465,Pre-market development times for innovative vaccines - to what extent are the COVID-19 vaccines outliers?,2021,"A most discussed topic of the new decade, COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2. With an exceedingly high transmission rate, COVID-19 has affected almost all the countries in the world. Absent any vaccine or specific treatment, the humanity is left with nothing but the legacy method of quarantine. However, quarantine can only be effective when combined with early diagnosis of suspected cases. With their high sensitivity and unmatched specificity, biosensors have become an area of interest for development of novel diagnostic methods. Compared to the more traditional diagnostics, nanobiotechnology introduces biosensors as different diagnostics with greater versatility in application. Today, a growing number of analytes are being accurately identified by these nanoscopic sensing machines. Several reports of validated application with real samples further strengthen this idea. As of recent, there has been a rise in the number of studies on portable biosensors. Despite the slow progression, certain devices with embedded biosensors have managed to be of diagnostic value in several countries. The perceptible increase in development of mobile platforms has revolutionized the healthcare delivery system in the new millennium. The present article reviews the most recent advancements in development of diagnostic nanobiosensors and their application in the clinical fields.

The impact of COVID-19 on the availability of donor organs and the impact on solid organ transplant remains unclear. We examine the impact of COVID-19 on a single, large-volume heart transplant program. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed examining all adult heart transplants performed at a single institution between March 2020 and June 2020. This was compared to the same time frame in 2019. We examined incidence of primary graft dysfunction, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and 30-day survival. RESULTS: From March to June 2020, 43 orthotopic heart transplants were performed compared to 31 performed during 2019. Donor and recipient demographics demonstrated no differences. There was no difference in 30-day survival. There was a statistically significant difference in incidence of postoperative CRRT (9/31 vs. 3/43; p = .01). There was a statistically significant difference in race (23 W/8B/1AA vs. 30 W/13B; p = .029). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a single, large-volume transplant program was able to grow volume with little difference in donor variables and clinical outcomes following transplant. While multiple reasons are possible, most likely the reduction of volume at other programs allowed us to utilize organs to which we would not have previously had access. More significantly, our growth in volume was coupled with no instances of COVID-19 infection or transmission amongst patients or staff due to an aggressive testing and surveillance program.","Balsara, Keki R; Rahaman, Zakiur; Sandhaus, Emily; Hoffman, Jordan; Zalawadiya, Sandip; McMaster, William; Lindenfeld, Joann; Wigger, Mark; Absi, Tarek; Brinkley, Douglas M; Menachem, Jonathan; Punnoose, Lynn; Sacks, Suzie; Schlendorf, Kelly; Shah, Ashish S",J Card Surg,,98

We carried out the present study to delineate the roles of these biomarkers in various strata of patients with coronavirus infection. Materials & methods: A retrospective study was carried out after obtaining approval from the relevant Ethics Committee. Patients established with COVID-19 infection as shown by positive real-time quantitative PCR test were included. Details on their demographics, diagnosis, whether they received tocilizumab, and the values of the following biomarkers were obtained: IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, D-dimer, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and correlation of biomarkers with IL-6 were estimated. Results: One-hundred and three patients were recruited. We observed that serum ferritin followed by D-dimer had better predictive accuracy in identifying patients with pneumonia compared with asymptomatic; and CRP in addition to the earlier markers had better accuracy for predicting severe illness compared with mild-moderate. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with severe illness admitted in intensive care unit. Significantly, higher levels of IL-6 and serum ferritin were observed in patients receiving tocilizumab. A trend of increased IL-6 levels was observed immediately following the initiation of tocilizumab therapy followed by a drop thereafter. Conclusion: We observed serum ferritin, D-dimer and CRP to accurately predict patients developing severe COVID-19 infections as well as those at risk of developing COVID pneumonia. A trend in IL-6 levels was observed in patients on tocilizumab therapy.","Farid, Eman; Sridharan, Kannan; Alsegai, Ola Am; Khawaja, Safa Al; Mansoor, Eman J; Teraifi, Noor A; Qahtani, Manaf Al; Salman, Jameela Al",Biomark Med,,98

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and CT manifestations between the ordinary patients and the severe/critical patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis.","Li, Kunhua; Wu, Jiong; Wu, Faqi; Guo, Dajing; Chen, Linli; Fang, Zheng; Li, Chuanming",Invest Radiol,,98

As the world is becoming more digitally oriented, the health care industry is increasingly visualizing SM as an important channel for health care promotion, employment, recruiting new patients, marketing for health care providers (HCPs), building a better brand name, etc. HCPs are bound to ethical principles toward their colleagues, patients, and the public in the digital world as much as in the real world. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to shed light on SM use worldwide and to discuss how it has been used as an essential tool in the health care industry from the perspective of HCPs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted between March and April 2020 using MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for all English-language medical studies that were published since 2007 and discussed SM use in any form for health care. Studies that were not in English, whose full text was not accessible, or that investigated patients' perspectives were excluded from this part, as were reviews pertaining to ethical and legal considerations in SM use. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 83 studies. More studies were included from article references, and a total of 158 studies were reviewed. SM uses were best categorized as health promotion, career development or practice promotion, recruitment, professional networking or destressing, medical education, telemedicine, scientific research, influencing health behavior, and public health care issues. CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional health care, including the pairing of health care with SM and other forms of communication, has been shown to be very successful. Striking the right balance between digital and traditional health care is important.","Farsi, Deema",J Med Internet Res,,98

313731,COVID-19: A PCR-defined pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, a RNA virus that emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China and took hold of the whole world, affects children as well as all age groups. In our country, we started to observe the first cases by March 2020. SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted by droplets and by way of contact with surfaces contaminated by these droplets, is generally transmitted to children from adults through close contact. There is no proven information about other transmission routes such as fecal-oral transmission. Similar to adults, the primary symptoms at presentation include fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, nasal dis-charge, and rarely, vomiting and diarrhea in children. Although the majority of pediatric patients are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, severe cases have been reported in children with underlying chronic diseases. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Supportive treatment is recommended in children with a mild course, and some treatments are recommended in children with comorbidities or in children who are observed to have a more severe course. Asymptomatic pediatric patients or pediatric patients who have a mild course constitute an important group in terms of transmission of the infection to the advanced age group who carry high risk. Prevention of infection is very important in terms of reducing new cases and alleviating the load on the health-care system. In order to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, hygienic rules should be pursued in the community, social distancing should be observed, and the family members and contacts of patients who have been diagnosed should be screened and isolated.","Çokuğraş, Haluk; Önal, Pınar",Turk Pediatr.

The uncontrolled influx of patients in need of emergency care has rapidly brought several national health systems to near-collapse with deadly consequences to those afflicted by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other critical diseases associated with COVID-19. Solid scientific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 remains scarce; there is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology to facilitate precise and targeted treatments. The capacity for rapid information dissemination has emerged as a double-edged sword; the existing gap of high-quality data is frequently filled by anecdotal reports, contradictory statements, and misinformation. This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity. Specifically, focus is given on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and preclinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning. The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring, and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.

Desde entonces su distribución se ha ampliado mundialmente causando una emergencia en los sistemas de salud. MÉTODO: Corresponde al reporte de caso clínico. Este estudio es descriptivo y se basa en el manejo realizado a paciente embarazada con COVID-19 confirmado. Esta publicación cuenta con la autorización del comité de ética local para la revisión de ficha clínica. CASO: Mujer de 40 años con un embarazo de 31 semanas, se le diagnostica COVID-19 tras contacto estrecho con caso confirmado. Evoluciona con disnea y por posibilidad de interrupción del embarazo se traslada a centro de mayor complejidad. Allí se pesquisa compromiso de función pulmonar, uso de musculatura accesoria y alteración sensorial, requiriendo oxigenoterapia. Se evalúa interdisciplinariamente decidiendo intubar y realizando manejo en unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI). Se realiza cesárea de urgencia a las 31+4 semanas debiendo realizarse histerectomía total por inercia uterina. Tras el procedimiento evoluciona tórpidamente con deterioro de función pulmonar, describiéndose un pronóstico catastrófico con probabilidad de fallecer por insuficiencia respiratoria. Un mes después despierta con una mejoría en su función pulmonar, sin otra falla orgánica. Actualmente se encuentra en buenas condiciones y es tratada multidisciplinariamente para lograr una rehabilitación integral. DISCUSIÓN: En epidemias pasadas, las embarazadas mostraron altas tasas de letalidad y riesgo de ingreso a UCI. Basados en una revisión de reportes de casos, parece ser que COVID-19 durante el embarazo se asocia a morbilidad materna severa, riesgo que aumenta en mujeres con comorbilidades, lo cual hace cuestionarnos si la infección por COVID-19 intensifica el riesgo materno o estos casos ya eran embarazos de riesgo. Se necesitan futuras investigaciones al respecto.","Orostizaga A, Ana; Apablaza R, Francisca; Garrido L, Bárbara; Zúñiga F, Paulina; Vaccarezza P, Italo; Wittkopf, Doreen",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

324979,Rare cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Descriptions of clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised withCOVID-19, their clinical course and short-term inpatient and outpatient outcomes in deprived urban populations in the UK are still relatively sparse. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequelae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London National Health Service Trust during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three respiratory units in the trust. RESULTS: Increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow-up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 70% of survivors, with 39% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be crucial in understanding the effect of differences in risk, as well as the effectiveness of new interventions and vaccination between the successive waves of the pandemic.","Cheng, Daryl; Calderwood, Claire; Skyllberg, Erik; Ainley, Adam",,,98
325454,Estimation of COVID-19 outbreak size in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, to angiotensin-(1-7) and is also a membrane protein that enables coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infectivity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of ACE2 enhances ACE2 stability. This mode of posttranslational modification of ACE2 in vascular endothelial cells is causative of a pulmonary hypertension (PH)-protective phenotype. The oncoprotein MDM2 (murine double minute 2) is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates its substrates to cause their degradation. In this study, we investigated whether MDM2 is involved in the posttranslational modification of ACE2 through its ubiquitination of ACE2, and whether an AMPK and MDM2 crosstalk regulates the pathogenesis of PH. METHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were used to explore E3 ligase that ubiquitinates ACE2. Cultured endothelial cells, mouse models, and specimens from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were used to investigate the crosstalk between AMPK and MDM2 in regulating ACE2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in the context of PH. RESULTS: Levels of MDM2 were increased and those of ACE2 decreased in lung tissues or pulmonary arterial endothelial cells from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and rodent models of experimental PH. MDM2 inhibition by JNJ-165 reversed the SU5416/hypoxia-induced PH in C57BL/6 mice. ACE2-S680L mice (dephosphorylation at S680) showed PH susceptibility, and ectopic expression of ACE2-S680L/K788R (deubiquitination at K788) reduced experimental PH. Moreover, ACE2-K788R overexpression in mice with endothelial cell-specific AMPK&#945;2 knockout mitigated PH. CONCLUSIONS: Maladapted posttranslational modification (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) of ACE2 at Ser-680 and Lys-788 is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and experimental PH. Thus, a combined intervention of AMPK and MDM2 in the pulmonary endothelium might be therapeutically effective in PH treatment.","Shen, Hui; Zhang, Jiao; Wang, Chen; Jain, Pritesh P; Xiong, Mingmei; Shi, Xinxing; Lei, Yuyang; Chen, Shanshan; Yin, Qian; Thistlethwaite, Patricia A; Wang, Jian; Gong, Kaizheng; Yuan, Zu-Yi; Yuan, Jason X-J; Shyy, John Y-J",Circulation,,98

Neurodevelopmental effects of in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection are widely speculated but currently unknown. The COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) initiative was established at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in New York City to prospectively study the health and wellbeing of infants with and without in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report findings on 6-month neurodevelopmental outcomes using the parental-report Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Edition (ASQ-3), from 107 in utero exposed and 131 unexposed full-term infants born between March and December, 2020. We compare these infants to a historical cohort comprised of 62 infants born at CUIMC at least two months prior to the onset of the pandemic. In utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with differences on any ASQ-3 subdomain regardless of infection timing or severity, however, infants born during the pandemic had significantly lower scores on gross motor, fine motor, and personal-social subdomains when compared to the historical cohort. Infants born to women who were in the first trimester of pregnancy during the peak of the pandemic in NYC had the lowest personal-social scores. Birth during the pandemic, but not maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6-months. These early findings suggest significantly higher public health impact for the generation born during the COVID-19 pandemic than previously anticipated.","Shuffrey, Lauren C.; Firestein, Morgan R.; Kyle, Margaret; Fields, Andrea; Alcantara, Carmela; Amso, Dima; Austin, Judy; Bain, Jennifer M.; Barbosa, Jennifer; Bence, Mary; Bianco, Catherine; Fernandez, Cristina; Goldman, Sylvie; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Hott, Violet; Hu, Yunzhe; Hussain, Maha; Factor-Litvak, Pam; Lucchini, Maristella; Mandel, Arthur; Marsh, Rachel; McBrian, Danielle; Mourad, Mirella; Muhle, Rebecca; Noble, Kimberly; Penn, Anna A.; Rodriguez, Cynthia; Sania, Ayesha; Silver, Wendy G.; Reilly, Kally C.

326425,CT scan does not make a diagnosis of Covid-19: a cautionary case report,2020,"Gut microbiota play an important role in host health. Yet, the drivers and patterns of microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) in wild animals remain largely unexplored. One hypothesised outcome of stress on animal microbiomes is a destabilised microbial community that is characterised by an increase in inter-individual differences compared with microbiomes of healthy animals, which are expected to be (a) temporally stable and (b) relatively similar among individuals. This set of predictions for response of microbiomes to stressors is known as the Anna Karenina principle (AKP) for animal microbiomes. We examine the AKP in a wild mammal inhabiting disturbed environments by conducting a capture-mark-recapture survey of bank voles Myodes glareolus in areas that contrast in levels of radionuclide contamination (Chernobyl, Ukraine). Counter to key predictions of the AKP, bank voles that are not exposed to radionuclides harbour variable (increased inter-individual differences) and temporally dynamic gut microbiota communities, presumably tracking the natural spatio-temporal variation in resources. Conversely, bank voles exposed to radionuclides host more similar gut microbiota communities that are temporally stable, potentially due to a dysbiosis or selection (on host or bacteria) imposed by chronic radiation exposure. The implication of these data is that environmental stress (radiation exposure) can constrain the natural spatial and temporal variation of wild animal gut microbiota.","Lavrinienko, Anton; Tukalenko, Eugene; Kesäniemi, Jenni; Kivisaari, Kati; Masiuk, Sergii; Boratynski, Zbyszek; Mousseau, Timothy A; Milinevsky, Gennadi; Mappes, Tapio; Watts, Phillip C",J. anim. ecol,,98

The relationship between the metrics or the goal of a target content and the content itself are non-trivial. While large scale language models show promising text generation capabilities, guiding and informing the generated text with external metrics is challenging. These metrics and the content tend to have inherent relationships and not all of them may directly impact the content. We introduce a CaM-Gen: Causally-aware Generative Networks guided by user-defined input metrics incorporating the causal relationships between the metric and the content features. We leverage causal inference techniques to identify the causally significant aspects of text that leads to the target metric and then explicitly guide the generative model towards these by a feedback mechanism. We propose this mechanism for variational autoencoder-based and transformer-based generative models. The proposed models beat baselines in terms of the target metric accuracy while maintaining the fluency and the language quality of the generated text. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the early attempts at incorporating a metric-guide using causal inference towards controlled generation.","Goyal, Navita; Paneri, Roodram; Agarwal, Ayush; Kalani, Udit; Sancheti, Abhilasha; Chhaya, Niyati",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12795v1.pdf,98

We aim to evaluate the critical care outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids for coexisting conditions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review within our hospital network to identify COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids for coexisting diseases. We collected data on patient characteristics and critical care outcomes. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and on corticosteroids (equivalent of Prednisone &gt; 5 mg daily) for at least 30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis met inclusion criteria. We excluded patients less than 18 years of age and patients treated as an outpatient. The means and frequencies of patient characteristics and critical care outcomes were calculated utilizing SPSS version 26. P-values were calculated through chi-square and Fisher exact test as indicated. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 948 charts were reviewed and 139 met inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into elderly (&gt; 65 years) and non-elderly (&lt; 65 years) groups. Median age amongst the elderly was 79 years (range 65-97 years) and 58 years (range 19-64 years) amongst the non-elderly. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the elderly group were Caucasian and nursing homes residents while the non-elderly group had a higher proportion of obese patients. There were no additional statistically significant variations between other characteristics, the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU or in the complications they subsequently suffered during hospital course (Table 1). Significantly more patients from the non-elderly group received steroids, vasopressors (p=0.03) and mechanical ventilation (p=0.03);however, the mortality was high in both groups of ICU patients (p=0.30). When comparing overall mortality, there was a significantly larger proportion of patient deaths in the elderly group (35.0% vs 7.6%, p= 0.001) and the hospital stay duration was significantly less (8.5 vs 11.7 days, p=0.04). These results contributed to fact that the elderly were sicker on admission and died shortly after limiting their access to critical care and overall admission length. Conclusion: Our data shows that COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids have higher mortality rates than the general population, and identifies elderly, obese, non-Caucasians and those requiring critical care support as high risk groups. Therefore, our study supports current literature that advocates cautious use of chronic corticosteroids when only clinically necessary.","Liaquat, H.; Shupp, B.; Rollins, S.; Patel, N.; Matin, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,98

Over the course of this journey, the author grapples with her inner biases and struggles with the emotional trauma associated with bearing witness to extraordinary suffering and social isolation imposed by COVID-19. Not only does the ethics of care approach embodied here lead to the creation of enduring vibrant works of art for this patient and others, but it also affirms a guiding principle of palliative care in which interdisciplinary collaboration is marshalled in the service of cultivating relationships, upholding responsibilities, and intensifying empathy among persons tied together by a common narrative.","Berlin, Assistant Professor Of Surgery And Medicine Ana",J. pain symptom manage,,98
329835,Containment of COVID-19 among ancillary healthcare workers: an integral component of infection control,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of single stranded RNA viruses, of which some of them such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with deadly worldwide human diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a condition caused by SARS-CoV-2, results in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality in the elderly and in people with underlying comorbidities. Results from several studies suggest that CoVs localize in mitochondria and interact with mitochondrial protein translocation machinery to target their encoded products to mitochondria. Coronaviruses encode a number of proteins; this process is essential for viral replication through inhibiting degradation of viral proteins and host misfolded proteins including those in mitochondria. These viruses seem to maintain their replication by altering mitochondrial dynamics and targeting mitochondrial-associated antiviral signaling (MAVS), allowing them to evade host innate immunity. Coronaviruses infections such as COVID-19 are more severe in aging patients. Since endogenous melatonin levels are often dramatically reduced in the aged and because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin has been proposed to be useful in CoVs infections by altering proteasomal and mitochondrial activities. Melatonin inhibits mitochondrial fission due to its antioxidant and inhibitory effects on cytosolic calcium overload. The collective data suggests that melatonin may mediate mitochondrial adaptations through regulating both mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. We propose that melatonin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage by regulating mitochondrial physiology.","Mehrzadi, Saeed; Karimi, Mohammad Yahya; Fatemi, Alireza; Reiter, Russel J; Hosseinzadeh, Azam",Pharmacol Ther,,98

This study aimed to investigate the qualitative impact of COVID-19 on surgical training in the United Kingdom (UK) & Republic of Ireland (ROI) METHODS: This national, collaborative, cross-sectional study involving 13 surgical trainee associations distributed a pan-surgical specialty questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training over 4 weeks in May 2020. Various aspects of training were assessed. RESULTS: 810 completed responses were analysed (malesâ¯=â¯401, femalesâ¯=â¯390) from all deaneries and training grades. The perceived negative overall impact of the pandemic on surgical training experience was significant. (Weighted averageâ¯=â¯8.66). 41% of respondents (nâ¯=â¯301) were redeployed with 74% redeployed for >4 weeks. Complete loss of training was reported in elective operating (69.5%), outpatient activity (67.3%) and endoscopy (69.5%). A reduction of >50% was reported in emergency operating (48%) and completion of work-based assessments (WBAs) (46%). 3.3% (nâ¯=â¯17) of respondents reported plans to leave medicine altogether. Cancellations in study leave and regional teaching programmes without rescheduling were reported in 72% and 60% of the cohort respectively. Elective operative exposure and WBAs completion were the primary reported factors affecting potential trainee progression. Only 9% of trainees reported that they would definitely meet all required competencies. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on surgical training across all grades and specialties, with implications for trainee progression, recruitment and retention of the surgical workforce. Further investigation of the long-term impact at a national level is required.",,Int J Surg,,98

Given the novelty of the disease, risk factors of mortality and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients remain to be elucidated. We present the results of a retrospective cohort study including patients admitted to a large tertiary-care, academic university hospital with COVID-19. Patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 April 2020. Baseline clinical characteristics and admission laboratory variables were retrospectively collected. Patients were grouped based on mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation. Prevalence of clinical co-morbidities and laboratory abnormalities were compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality, ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Predictors significant at P &#8804; .10 were included in multivariate analysis. Five hundred and sixty patients were included in the analysis. Age and myocardial injury were only independent predictors of mortality, in patients with/without baseline co-morbidities. Body mass index, elevated ferritin, elevated d-dimer, and elevated procalcitonin predicted need for ICU care, and these along with vascular disease at baseline predicted need for mechanical ventilation. Hence, inflammatory markers (ferritin and d-dimer) predicted severe disease, but not death.","Harmouch, Farah; Shah, Kashyap; Hippen, John T; Kumar, Ashish; Goel, Harsh",J Med Virol,,98

The aim of this investigation was to assess FPs mental health, as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding the pandemic, and opinions on non-communicable disease (NCD) health care provided to patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 613 FPs. Anxiety and depression levels were estimated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, subjective perceived stress with the Perceived Stress Scale, while trauma-related symptoms were assessed using the Impact on Event Scale-COVID19. KAPs toward the pandemic and opinions regarding NCD patients were evaluated with questionnaires accordingly. Results have shown that age (ß = -0.02, p = 0.013) and personal risk of COVID­19 (ß = 1.05, p < 0.001) were significant independent correlates of the knowledge score. A total of 87.7% FPs expressed moderate/high perceived stress, 45.2% moderate/severe trauma-related symptoms, 60.4% borderline/abnormal anxiety levels, and 52.4% borderline/abnormal depression levels. Knowledge score was an independent predictor of perceived stress (ß = -0.33, p = 0.023) and anxiety (ß = -0.31, p = 0.006) levels. Limited accessibility to healthcare services and decreased number of newly-diagnosed NCD cases were mostly agreed on. The pandemic puts a considerable strain on FPs mental health, as well as on public health measures, due to the decreased overall quality of NCD patient health care. Educational programs may bridge the gaps between FPs' knowledge. Thus lowering anxiety and improving patient care.","Vilovic, Tina; Bozic, Josko; Vilovic, Marino; Rusic, Doris; Zuzic Furlan, Sanja; Rada, Marko; Tomicic, Marion",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,98

340056,In-Depth Evaluation of a Case of Presumed Myocarditis After the Second Dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine,2021,"The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients and is included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We divided 741 ADNI participants with blood microarray data into three groups based on their most recent CDR assessment: cognitive normal (CDR = 0), mild cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5), and probable Alzheimer's disease (CDR &#8805; 1.0). We then used machine learning to predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels. Only one probe for chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) was significant after correction. However, by combining individually nonsignificant probes with p-values less than 0.1, we averaged 87.87% (s = 1.02) predictive accuracy for classifying the three groups, compared to a 55.46% baseline for this study due to unequal group sizes. The best model had an overall precision of 0.902, recall of 0.895, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.904. Although we identified one significant probe in CLIC1, CLIC1 levels alone were not sufficient to predict dementia status and cannot be used alone in a clinical setting. Additional analyses combining individually suggestive, but nonsignificant, blood RNA levels were significantly predictive and may improve diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we propose that patient features that do not individually predict cognitive status might still contribute to overall cognitive decline through interactions that can be elucidated through machine learning.","Miller, Justin B; Kauwe, John S K",,,98

Studies are warranted that examine socio-ecological factors associated with these outcomes to inform interventions that support healthcare workers during future disease outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study of healthcare workers during May 2020 to assess the socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed factors at four socio-ecological levels: individual (e.g., gender), interpersonal (e.g., social support), institutional (e.g., personal protective equipment availability), and community (e.g., healthcare worker stigma). The Personal Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise scales assessed probable major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,092 participants, 72.0% were female, 51.9% were frontline workers, and the mean age was 40.4 years (standard deviation = 11.5). Based on cut-off scores, 13.9%, 15.6%, 22.8%, and 42.8% had probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD, respectively. In the multivariable adjusted models, needing more social support was associated with significantly higher odds of probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD. The significance of other factors varied across the outcomes. For example, at the individual level, female gender was associated with probable PTSD. At the institutional level, lower team cohesion was associated with probable PTSD, and difficulty following hospital policies with probable MD. At the community level, higher healthcare worker stigma was associated with probable PTSD and AUD, decreased satisfaction with the national government response with probable GAD, and higher media exposure with probable GAD and PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform targeted interventions that promote healthcare workers' psychological resilience during disease outbreaks.","Hennein, Rachel; Mew, Emma J; Lowe, Sarah R",PLoS One,,98

Organizing Pneumonia (OP) may be occurring more frequently than realized in patients with lung injury from COVID-19. This case report reviews the presentation and disease course of AFOP in a patient with COVID-19. Case description:A 49-year-old male with a history of Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma on Venetoclax and Obinutuzumab presented with fever, exertional dyspnea, and dry cough and was diagnosed with COVID-19. His CT scan showed extensive peripheral predominant patchy and heterogenous ground glass opacities with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Image A). His serum aspergillus galactomannan index was 4.37 and he was started on voriconazole. He however remained febrile;so, he had a transbronchial cryobiopsy. His pathology revealed marked interstitial T-cell lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. There was proliferative bronchiolitis and evidence of acute pulmonary hemorrhage, without features of vasculitis/capillaritis. No evidence of malignancy or organisms were identified. He was started on methylprednisolone daily and he initially improved, however, his fever returned and his oxygen requirements increased rapidly with steroid taper. His repeat chest CT scan showed a marked increase in bilateral patchy areas of consolidation with surrounding areas of ground glass opacity and intralobular septal thickening (""crazy paving"") Image B. His infectious work up was extensive but negative. At this point, he required invasive mechanical ventilation;after which he received pulse dose steroids for three days followed by high dose maintenance. He improved and was extubated. However, he required high flow supplemental oxygen and was unable to be weaned past 100% fraction of inspired oxygen;as a result, Ruxolitinib was added. Unfortunately, his hypoxemia remained refractory and he developed sudden cardiovascular collapse which led to his demise. The patient died 40 days after admission. Discussion: Understanding the histopathology, disease course, and sequelae of COVID-19 is of paramount importance, because AFOP in COVID-19 adds complexity to management. Our patient's antemortem biopsy was performed prior to acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanical ventilation as opposed to previous case reports with post mortem findings of AFOP after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Notably, 30% - 60% of intensive care patients with SARS CoV 1 had OP and AFOP. Additionally, the CT findings of COVID-19 are similar to OP and this lends support to the possibility that OP is an underlying pattern of lung injury in COVID-19.","Forson, M.; Bajaj, D.; Ramalingam, V.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,98

349181,What does 95% COVID-19 vaccine efficacy really mean?,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mathematical, statistical, and computational models provide insight into the transmission mechanisms and optimal control of healthcare-associated infections. To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts. SUMMARY: As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations. However, with effective communication of findings and interdisciplinary collaboration, opportunities for implementing models for clinical decision-making and public health decision-making are bound to increase.","Stachel, Anna; Keegan, Lindsay T; Blumberg, Seth",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,98

Since the pathogenesis of CARDS it probably involves a direct viral attack to pulmonary and endothelium cells, and immune-mediated inflammation with dysfunctional coagulation, it was suggested to interfere with interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity by using the IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ). We reported the case of a 54-year-old 100 kg male COVID-19 patient (BMI 29) with severe respiratory insufficiency featuring dyspnea and hypoxia (SpO2 89% on room; PaO2 53 mmHg). Despite treatment with antiviral and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), after 24 h there was a progressive worsening of clinical conditions with higher fever (40 °C), increased dyspnea, and hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio of 150). The patient was at the limit to be sedated and intubated for IMV. He was treated with tocilizumab (8 mg/Kg i.v., single shot 800 mg) and NIV in the prone positioning. After only 96 h, the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings showed incredible improvement. There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of C-reactive protein values, and a decrease of the fever. Both the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the derived NLR ratio dropped down to 44%. Chest imaging confirmed the favorable response. This case suggested that for CARDS management efforts are needed for reducing its underlying inflammatory processes. Through a multiprofessional approach, the combination of IL-6-targeting therapies with calibrated ventilatory strategies may represent a winning strategy for improving outcomes.","Cascella, Marco; Mauro, Immacolata; De Blasio, Elvio; Crispo, Anna; Del Gaudio, Alfredo; Bimonte, Sabrina; Cuomo, Arturo; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio",Medicina (Kaunas),,98

Predictions of the further course of the epidemic are decisive to deploy targeted disease control measures. We consider a network-based model to describe the 2019-nCoV epidemic in the Hubei province. The network is composed of the cities in Hubei and their interactions (e.g., traffic flow). However, the precise interactions between cities is unknown and must be inferred from observing the epidemic. We propose a network-based method to predict the future prevalence of the 2019-nCoV virus in every city.

351441,Herd immunity and vaccination of children for COVID-19,2020,"Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR or susceptible-infectious-recovered) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.","Thomas, Loring J; Huang, Peng; Yin, Fan; Luo, Xiaoshuang Iris; Almquist, Zack W; Hipp, John R; Butts, Carter T",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,98

AIM: To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation. METHOD: An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs. RESULTS: A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor. CONCLUSIONS: Family health, news media consumption, and loss of work hours are associated with COVID-19 protection motivation. COVID-19 protection motivation might be enhanced through policies and messaging that can affect ecological sources of influence.","Hanson, Carl L; Crandall, Ali; Barnes, Michael D; Novilla, M Lelinneth",Health Educ Behav,,98

Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis. METHODS: To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group. RESULTS: Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that dialysis had a limited effect on cognitive improvement.","Ma, Shaohui; Zhang, Ming; Liu, Yang; Ding, Dun; Li, Peng; Ma, Xueying; Liu, Hongjuan; Mu, Junya",BMC Nephrol,,98

354414,That Escalated Quickly: Remdesivir's Place in Therapy for COVID-19,2020,"Neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are among the most promising approaches against COVID-191,2. A bispecific IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) has been developed on the basis of C121 and C135, two antibodies derived from donors who had recovered from COVID-193. Here we show that CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable spike binding to the cellular receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonal antibodies. We also found that in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, the simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, and combines the advantages of antibody cocktails with those of single-molecule approaches.","De Gasparo, Raoul; Pedotti, Mattia; Simonelli, Luca; Nickl, Petr; Muecksch, Frauke; Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Mazzola, Federica; Magrì, Davide; Michalcikova, Tereza; Haviernik, Jan; Honig, Vaclav; Mrazkova, Blanka; Polakova, Natalie; Fortova, Andrea; Tureckova, Jolana; Iatsiuk, Veronika; Di Girolamo, Salvatore; Palus, Martin; Zudova, Dagmar; Bednar, Petr; Bukova, Ivana; Bianchini, Filippo; Mehn, Dora; Nencka, Radim; Strakova, Petra; Pavlis, Oto; Rozman, Jan; Gioria, Sabrina; Sammartino, Josè Camilla; Giardina, Federica; Gaiarsa, Stefano; Pan-Hammarström, Qiang; Barnes, Christopher O; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Calzolai, Luigi; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Bieniasz, Paul D; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Prochazka, Jan; Sedlacek, Radislav; Robbiani, Davide F; Ruzek, Daniel; Varani, Luca",Nature,,98

To evaluate the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies induced in convalescent patients against emerging variants, we isolate anti-spike mAbs from two convalescent COVID-19 patients infected with prototypic SARS-CoV-2 by single-cell sorting of immunoglobulin-G-positive (IgG+) memory B cells. Anti-spike antibody induction is robust in these patients, and five mAbs have potent neutralizing activities. The efficacy of most neutralizing mAbs and convalescent plasma samples is maintained against B.1.1.7 and mink cluster 5 variants but is significantly decreased against variants B.1.351 from South Africa and P.1 from Brazil.

361864,The time-varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and synchronous actions in China,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats. Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called 'COVID-19', as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements.

The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration. METHODS: The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa <0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa >0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively).

363784,Preliminary Assessment of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Children Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Analysis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency medicine (EM) is a high-risk specialty for burnout. COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Rodrick; Aarsen, Kristine Van; Gray, Sara; Rang, Louise; Fitzpatrick, Jada; Fischer, Lisa",CJEM,,98

The study describes 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who developed an acute erythematous rash with nonfollicular pinhead-sized pustules, without mucosal involvement. The clinical differential diagnosis was viral rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), or multiform erythema. computed tomography with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia and a respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients had signs of respiratory distress and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Punch biopsies showed subcorneal pustules typical of AGEP. Dermal microvascular injury and thrombosis as described in skin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed. The direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative in 8 patients investigated. A polymerase chain reaction for RNA SARS-CoV-2 performed on frozen skin was negative in 5 of 6 patients. Most of our patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. After some days (4-10), the diffuse erythema and pustules had improved. AGEP is classified as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, provoked by drugs and acute infections. Characteristically, removal of the offending agent leads to spontaneous resolution typically in less than 15 days. The recognition of AGEP is important, in order to avoid confusion with a systemic infection and consequently to avoid incorrect treatment. Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs are common and are major health problems worldwide causing considerable costs for health care systems. We suggest that in the patients with AGEP during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, viral infection is a risk factor for developing drug reaction.","Pezzarossa, Enrico; Ungari, Marco; Caresana, Gioachino; Sagradi, Fabio; Cimardi, Leonardo; Pan, Angelo; Testa, Sophie; Aguggini, Sergio; Varotti, Elena; Tanzi, Giulia; Manotti, Laura; Ferrero, Giuseppina; Gusolfino, Marino Daniel; Trombatore, Monica",Am. j. dermatopathol,,98

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for diagnostic, development of antibodies, entry inhibitors, and vaccines. COVID-19 also recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor binding to viral S protein. Several antiviral drugs and vaccines have been evaluated for the treatment and prevention of the infection by the virus. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, the problems associated with antiviral drugs and vaccines development for containing the spread of COVID-19 are discussed. There is an urgent need to study deeply on the structure, mutations, and function of COVID-19 as well as its pathophysiology from a large population. Construction of expression vectors for any protein targeting to the cell plasma membrane via the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, GPI, anchor for studying intermolecular interactions, as described in Ref. # 62 (Nguyen, K.

We describe the serum lipid profile of the patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected the first clinical laboratory data of 114 patients on admission, and 80 healthy controls. Meanwhile, we monitored the serum lipid profile, COVID-19 nucleic acid and chest CT scan of a severe patient from the early stage of infection to the recovery period for a total of 80 days. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients had sharply decreased concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001). Among the patients, HDL-cholesterol concentration in severe groups was significantly lower than the common groups [1.01 (0.88-1.20) vs 1.21 (1.02-1.48) mmol/l, P < 0.001]. The lipid profile of a severe patient showed that serum cholesterol concentration significantly decreased in the early stage and returned to be normal in the recovery period. Moreover, the change of HDL-cholesterol in this patient was consistent with the results of nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans. In correlation analysis, HDL-cholesterol concentration was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP, r = -0.396, P < 0.001) and positively correlated with lymphocytes (r = 0.336, P < 0.001). The area under curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of HDL-cholesterol was 0.732 (P < 0.001), and, the adjusted odd ratio (OR) of HDL-cholesterol was 0.023 (95% CI 0.002-0.227). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased serum HDL-cholesterol is associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Hu, Xingzhong; Chen, Dong; Wu, Lianpeng; He, Guiqing; Ye, Wei",Clin Chim Acta,,98
368094,Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic COVID-19 in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Copper appears to have strong antimicrobial properties under laboratory conditions. AIM: We conducted a systematic review to examine the potential effect of copper treating of commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities. METHODS: We included controlled trials comparing the effect of copper-treated surfaces (furniture or bed linens) in hospital rooms versus standard rooms on hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Two reviewers independently screened retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the occurrence of healthcare acquired infections. FINDINGS: We screened 638 records; 7 studies comprising 12362 patients were included. From risk of bias assessment, all included studies were judged to be at high risk in &#8805;2 of the 7 domains of bias. All 7 included studies reported the effect of various copper-treated surfaces on HAIs. Overall, we found low quality evidence of a potential clinical importance that copper-treated hard surfaces and/or bed linens and clothes reduced healthcare acquired infections by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94; I2 = 44%, p-value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Given the clinical and economic costs of healthcare acquired infections, the potentially protective effect of copper-treated surfaces appears important. However, the current evidence is insufficient to make a strong positive recommendation. However, it would appear worthwhile and urgent to conduct larger scale publicly funded clinical trials of the impact of copper coating.","Albarqouni, Loai; Byambasuren, Oyuka; Clark, Justin; Scott, Anna Mae; Looke, David; Glasziou, Paul",J. hosp. infect,,98

This paper aims to review the most recent medical imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and their potential contributions to attenuate the pandemic. Recent researches, including artificial intelligence tools, will be described. METHODS: We review the main clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by different medical imaging techniques. First, we present the clinical findings of each technique. Then, we describe several artificial intelligence approaches introduced for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: CT is the most accurate diagnostic modality of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the most common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in CT images. However, other findings such as reticular pattern, and crazy paving could be observed. We also found that pleural effusion and pneumothorax features are less common in SARS-CoV-2. According to the literature, the B lines artifacts and pleural line irregularities are the common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in ultrasound images. We have also stated the different studies, focusing on artificial intelligence tools, to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 severity. We found that most of the reported works based on deep learning focused on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from medical images while the challenge for the radiologists is how to differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections with the same clinical features. CONCLUSION: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 manifestations on medical images is a key step in radiological workflow for the diagnosis of the virus and could be useful for researchers working on computer-aided diagnosis of pulmonary infections.","Benameur, Narjes; Mahmoudi, Ramzi; Zaid, Soraya; Arous, Younes; Hmida, Badii; Bedoui, Mohamed Hedi",Clin Imaging,,98

The challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic can contribute to increase procrastination behaviors in academic activities that the student does not like and in those he/she is passionate. The main objective of this research was to test an integrative model of passion, procrastination, satisfaction with life and psychological distress in students during pandemic. The sample was comprised of 416 university students aged between 18 and 57 years (M age = 24.81 ± 7.02, 78.1% women). Structural Equation Modeling results revealed that academic procrastination is negatively linked to harmonious passion, and positively linked to obsessive passion. Academic procrastination in turn is negatively linked to satisfaction with life and positively linked to psychological distress. Harmonious passion also was directly positively associated to satisfaction with life and negatively associated to psychological distress. These results suggest that students' harmonious passion for their studies plays a protective role against academic procrastination and mental health indicators, while obsessive passion represents a risk factor.","Peixoto, Evandro Morais; Pallini, Ana Celi; Vallerand, Robert J; Rahimi, Sonia; Silva, Marcus Vinicius",Soc Psychol Educ,,98

METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with stakeholders (N=14) and peer specialists (N=37) to better understand delivery of peer support services for justice-involved individuals in Pennsylvania. Thematic analysis followed by directed content analysis was used to identify factors in three a priori implementation categories based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) model: initial facilitators (adoption), barriers (implementation), and facilitators (maintenance) to long-term sustainability. RESULTS: Initial service adoption was facilitated by buy-in from recovery-oriented gatekeepers in the criminal justice system. Unique implementation barriers included the chasm between the orientations of the two systems (recovery vs. punitive) and formal and informal limitations on the employment of individuals with criminal justice system exposure. For services to be sustainable and have an impact over the long term, FPS advocates and workers must develop rapport with on-the-ground employees of the criminal justice system. Funding barriers specific to the criminal justice system limited the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of FPS services. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the factors that affect FPS service implementation were similar to those identified in the broader peer support literature, important differences must be addressed for successful FPS service delivery. Within the criminal justice system, both policies and norms presented barriers to the expansion of peer support services for justice-involved individuals.","Adams, Wallis E; Lincoln, Alisa K",Psychiatr Serv,,98

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of central nervous system (CNS) tissue in brain model systems and from adults with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have begun to uncover potential mechanisms for neurological damage during COVID-19. These studies suggest that direct viral invasion of the CNS occurs in a subset of cases but does not frequently cause overt viral meningoencephalitis. Vascular abnormalities including microvascular thrombi and endothelial activation, as well as parainfectious processes, including CNS specific immune responses, may contribute to neurological symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. SUMMARY: Neuroimmune perturbations and vascular inflammation observed in people with COVID-19 may warrant investigation of immune-modulating interventions to ameliorate neurological complications associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. These therapies may also impact the trajectory of potential long-term complications of COVID-19.","Farhadian, Shelli F; Seilhean, Danielle; Spudich, Serena",Curr Opin Neurol,,98
380654,Unusual case of cholecystocolonic fistula secondary to megabowel,2020,"In response to the rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), with ten thousands of deaths and intensive-care hospitalizations, a large number of regions and countries have been put under lockdown by their respective governments. Policy makers are confronted in this situation with the problem of balancing public health considerations, with the economic costs of a persistent lockdown. We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rates evolve dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. Social distancing measures are triggered by the number of infections, providing a dynamic feedback-loop which slows the spread of the virus. We estimate the total cost of several distinct containment policies incurring over the entire path of the endemic. Costs comprise direct medical cost for intensive care, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, the total costs are highest at a medium level of reactivity when value of life costs are omitted. Very strict measures fare best, with a hands-off policy coming second. Our key findings are independent of the specific parameter estimates, which are to be adjusted with the COVID-19 research status. In addition to numerical simulations, an explicit analytical solution for the controlled continuous-time SIR model is presented. For an uncontrolled outbreak and a reproduction factor of three, an additional 28% of the population is infected beyond the herd immunity point, reached at an infection level of 66%, which adds up to a total of 94%.","Gros, Claudius; Valenti, Roser; Valenti, Kilian; Gros, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00493v1.pdf,98

382436,"Children's Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, Associated With a New Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19): Relevant Information and Clinical Observation",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented time for healthcare and has substantially changed resource availability in surgeons' work practices and routines. Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of &#8804; 7 , 8 to 10, and &#8805; 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean ± SD age was 30 ± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

382445,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients: A case-control study,2020,"We study a generalized operating room planning and scheduling (GORPS) problem at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) in Ontario, Canada. GORPS allocates elective patients and resources (i.e., operating rooms, surgeons, anesthetists) to days, assigns resources to patients, and sequences patients in each day. We consider patients’ due-date, resource eligibility, heterogeneous performances of resources, downstream unit requirements, and lag times between resources. The goal is to create a weekly surgery schedule that minimizes fixed- and over-time costs. We model GORPS using mixed-integer and constraint programming models. To efficiently and effectively solve these models, we develop new‘ multi-featured logic-based Benders decomposition approaches. Using data from TGH, we demonstrate that our best algorithm solves GORPS with an average optimality gap of 2.71% which allows us to provide our practical recommendations. First, we can increase daily OR utilization to reach 80%—25% higher than the status quo in TGH. Second, we do not require to optimize for the daily selection of anesthetists—this finding allows for the development of effective dominance rules that significantly mitigate intractability. Third, solving GORPS without downstream capacities (like many papers in literature) makes GORPS easier to solve, but such OR schedules are only feasible in 24% of instances. Finally, with existing ORs’ safety capacities, TGH can manage 40% increase in its surgical volumes. We provide recommendations on how TGH must adjust its downstream capacities for varying levels of surgical volume increases (e.g., current urgent need for more capacity due to the current Covid-19 pandemic). © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society","Naderi, B.; Roshanaei, V.; Begen, M.

As the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to increase amid supply shortages, many laboratories have investigated the use of sources other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and mid-turbinate nasal swabs are attractive alternatives as they allow for self-collection and are well-accepted by patients. Saliva also requires limited consumables. We compared the performance of health care provider-collected NP swabs, patient-collected mid-turbinate (MT) swabs, and patient-collected saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection using a laboratory developed PCR assay that had received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Of 281 total evaluable samples, 33 (11.7%) NP swabs, 33 (11.7%) MT swabs, and 32 (11.4%) saliva specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 following resolution of discordant results. When compared to NP swabs, saliva exhibited a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248), while patient-collected MT swabs exhibited a sensitivity of 93.9% (31/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248). When comparing to the consensus standard, the sensitivity was 100% (31/31) for both NP and MT swabs and 96.8% (30/31) for saliva specimens, while specificity was the same in both NP swabs and saliva specimens (98.8% [247/250]) and 99.2% (248/250) for MT swabs. Pre-treatment of saliva with proteinase K and heating for 15 minutes prior to extraction reduced the invalid rate from 26.7% (52/195) to 0% (0/195). These data show that patient-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs and saliva are suitable sources for self-collection in individuals who require routine monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Boerger, Aimee C; Buckwalter, Seanne; Fernholz, Emily C; Jannetto, Paul J; Binnicker, Matthew J; Reed, Katelyn; Walchak, Robert; Woodliff, Ethan; Johnson, Michael; Pritt, Bobbi S",J Clin Microbiol,,98
385375,Association of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with COVID-19 prognosis,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, identifying which risk factors are associated with the most serious forms of the disease is important. Blood group A has been presented in various studies as a poor prognostic factor. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients with blood group A were associated with more important comorbidities, measured by the Charlson Index, which may explain their worse clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective and consecutive study examined 100 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted in March 2020. A multivariate linear regression model was used to evaluate the association of blood group A with the Charlson Index. RESULTS: Patients in group A had a higher Charlson Index (P=.037), rate of lymphopenia (P=.039) and thrombopenia (P=.014), and hospital mortality (P=.044). Blood group A was an independent factor associated with the Charlson Index (B 0.582, 95% CI 0.02-1.14, P=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Group A was independently associated with greater comorbidity, associated with an increase of 0.582 points in the Charlson Index compared to other blood groups. It was also associated with lower hospital mortality.","Tamayo-Velasco, Álvaro; Jiménez García, María Teresa; Sánchez Rodríguez, Alba; Hijas Villaizan, Milagros; Carretero Gómez, Juana; Miramontes-González, José Pablo",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,98

We demonstrate here that Favipiravir predominantly exerts an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp complex is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and higherror rates allowing facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome.

This study aimed to discover the behaviour of a group of dependent drinkers of spirits during a 33-day period of complete closure of physical stores selling spirits during COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland, New Zealand, March 2020. METHODS: Electronic clinical records of drinkers waitlisted to complete an alcohol detox at the in-patient service were followed from day 1 of lockdown and outcomes at the end of the period analysed. RESULTS: Drinkers of spirits were statistically more successful in stopping drinking (P = 0.002) than those of wine or beer. Only 26% chose to switch to an alternate alcohol type initially. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A sudden reduction in availability of spirits resulted in positive behaviour change in spirits drinkers compared to those of other alcohol types, aided by the support of detox services. Internet alcohol purchasing, while not used by this group, deserves close future scrutiny due to its potential to increase alcohol availability in dependent drinkers.","Falkner, Carolyn; Neave, Hamish",Drug alcohol rev,,98

Cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy using oxaliplatin has attracted attention; however, the short half-life of oxaliplatin and its rapid clearance from the peritoneal cavity limit its clinical application. Here, a multivesicular liposomal (MVL) depot of oxaliplatin was prepared for IP administration, with an expected prolonged effect. After optimization, a combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, and triolein was used based on its ability to produce MVL depots of monomodal size distribution (1-20 µm; span 1.99) with high entrapment efficiency (EE) (92.16% ± 2.17%). An initial burst release followed by a long lag phase of drug release was observed for the MVL depots system in vitro. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study mimicking the early postoperative IP chemotherapy regimen in rats showed significantly improved bioavailability, and the mean residence time of oxaliplatin after IP administration revealed that slow and continuous erosion of the MVL particles yielded a sustained drug release. Thus, oxaliplatin-loaded MVL depots presented in this study have potential for use in the treatment of colorectal cancer.","Abuzar, Sharif Md; Park, Eun Jung; Seo, Yeji; Lee, Juseung; Baik, Seung Hyuk; Hwang, Sung-Joo",,,98

392290,When Epidemics Collide: Why People with HIV May Have Worse COVID-19 Outcomes and Implications for Vaccination,2021,"Objectives: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 caused a worldwide pandemic. This disease also impacts European countries, including Germany. Without effective medicines or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the best strategy to reduce the number of cases. Study design: A deterministic model was simulated to evaluate the number of infectious and healthcare demand. Method: Using an age-structured SEIR model for the COVID-19 transmission, we project the COVID-19-associated demand for hospital and ICU beds within Germany. We estimated the effectiveness of different control measures, including active case-finding and quarantining of asymptomatic persons, self-isolation of people who had contact with an infectious person, and physical distancing, as well as a combination of these control measures. Results: We found that contact tracing could reduce the peak of ICU beds as well as mass testing. The time delay between diagnosis and self-isolation influences the control measures. Physical distancing to limit the contact rate would delay the peak of the outbreak, which results in the demand for ICU beds being below the capacity during the early outbreak. Conclusions: Our study analyzed several scenarios in order to provide policymakers that face the pandemic of COVID-19 with insights into the different measures available. We highlight that the individuals who have had contact with a virus-positive person must be quarantined as soon as possible to reduce contact with possible infectious cases and to reduce transmission. Keeping physical distance and having fewer contacts should be implemented to prevent overwhelming ICU demand.","Chadsuthi, Sudarat; Modchang, Charin",Public Health Pract (Oxf),,98

We present a single academic center's experience providing physical and occupational therapy to critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods:All patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated illness admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 1st to July 31st, 2020 were identified in this retrospective chart review. Patients who received at least one therapy treatment session were included in the study. Results:Three-hundred and seventy-nine physical and occupational therapy sessions were conducted with 116 patients. The majority (85%) of patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median number of treatment sessions during ICU admission per patient was 2, (IQR: 1-4). The median time from ICU admission to first PT session was 4 days (IQR, 3-5). The median percentage of ICU days with physical and occupational therapy treatment was 33% (IQR, 21-50). The median session length was 25 minutes (IQR, 25-30min). Sitting was achieved in 353 sessions, (93%) standing was achieved in 261 sessions (69%), walking was achieved in 185 sessions (48%), and sitting in the bedside chair 118 times (31%).Patients with respiratory failure completed therapy sessions while receiving mechanical ventilation (21% of sessions), high flow nasal cannula (45% of sessions), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation by helmet and facemask (7% of sessions), and ECMO (12% of sessions). Patients requiring vasoactive medications (4%) and continuous renal replacement therapy (6%) were also treated by physical and occupational therapy. Delirium, determined by confusion assessment method (CAM-ICU), was frequently encountered by the physical and occupational therapy teams and was not an absolute barrier (32%) (Table 1).

394761,The correlation between clinical features and viral RNA shedding in outpatients with COVID-19,2020,"We report the emergency development and application of a robust serologic test to evaluate acute and convalescent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. The assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used for clinical trials and therapies across the country. Using this protocol, about 80% of convalescent donor plasmas were potentially suitable for therapies. Here, we demonstrate the importance of providing a robust and specific serologic assay for generating new information about antibody kinetics in infected individuals and mitigation policies to cope with pandemic needs.","Ojeda, Diego S; Gonzalez Lopez Ledesma, María Mora; Pallarés, Horacio M; Costa Navarro, Guadalupe S; Sanchez, Lautaro; Perazzi, Beatriz; Villordo, Sergio M; Alvarez, Diego E; Echavarria, Marcela; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian S; Lee, Benhur; Carradori, Jorge; Caramelo, Julio J; Yanovsky, Marcelo J; Gamarnik, Andrea V",PLoS Pathog,,98

Methods: In line with the suggestions by Rabenau and colleagues, the automated ARIES SARS-CoV-2 Assay was challenged with strongly positive samples, weakly positive samples and negative samples. Further, intra-assay and inter-assay precision as well as the limit-of-detection (lod) were defined with quantified target RNA and DNA. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-Cov-2 Assay was used as gold standard. Results: Concordance between the ARIES assay and the Cepheid assay was 100% for strongly positive samples and for negative samples, respectively. For weakly positive samples as confirmed applying the Cepheid assay, a relevant minority of 4 out of 15 samples (26.7%) went undetected by the ARIES assay. Intra- and inter-assay precision were satisfactory, while the lod was in the 103 DNA copies/reaction-range, in the 103 virus copies/reaction-range, or in the 103-104 free RNA copies/reaction-range in our hands. Conclusions: The automated ARIES assay shows comparable test characteristics as the Cepheid assay focusing on strongly positive and negative samples but a slightly reduced sensitivity with weakly positive samples.

In this article, we explore: what does building back better look like if gender equality was at its core? What kinds of feminist dilemmas arise with respect to how we frame women’s voice and agency as we advocate for transformative systemic change? We start with a vision for building back better with a gender lens;and move on to discuss the gender-specific impacts of Covid-19 that exacerbate the vulnerabilities of women and girls In connection with the latter, we discuss the feminist dilemmas that arise with respect to discourse on women’s agency, representation, participation, and the key issues that we need to consider for transforming systemic gender power hierarchies © 2021 The Authors IDS Bulletin © Institute of Development Studies","Nazneen, S.; Araujo, S.",IDS Bulletin,,98

Three-generation transmission was observed. Through epidemiological investigation, we observed asymptomatic transmission to a cohabiting family member, as well as person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Wuhan city. The asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here provides evidence that there could be a greater risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. This cluster also demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmissible during the incubation period of an asymptomatic person. Early isolation and treatment, stressing prevention of cluster outbreaks, could help prevent further spread of the epidemic.","Sun, Yong; Tian, Lin; Du, Xiaomei; Wang, Hua; Li, Yueshan; Wu, Rangbing",Epidemiol Infect,,98
405377,Will environmental changes in temperature affect the course of COVID-19?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Children with sensory food aversions (SFAs) are at risk for nutritional problems and occupational dysfunction during daily meals. To facilitate optimal occupational performance for children with SFAs, it is critical that clinicians understand child behaviour and caregiver strategy use to manage child behaviour during meals. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reliability of a novel coding scheme, the Behavioural Mealtime Coding System (BMCS) and identify associations among child acceptance of preferred and targeted foods, child food exploration and caregiver use of strategies to manage child behaviour. METHODS: Twenty-one children (aged 18-60 months) with SFAs and their caregivers were recruited using a convenience sample. An observational video coding system was developed to code mealtime behaviour in 63 typical mealtime videos recorded by caregivers in the home environment. Inter-rater reliability, descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were calculated. RESULTS: The BMCS demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = .95). Child bites of targeted foods were associated with mealtime duration (rs = .51, p = .02) and events of the child licking food (rs = .57, p = .007). Caregiver use of threats was positively associated with child age (rs = .48, p = .03) and negatively associated with caregiver education level (rs = -.49, p = .03). CONCLUSION: For children with SFAs, increasing mealtime duration by embedding positive activities to encourage food exploration may improve acceptance of healthy targeted foods. Future research is needed to better understand the complex relationships among caregiver strategy use, mealtime duration and child mealtime behaviour.","Caldwell, Angela R; Krause, Elise K",,,98

We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role. VI may augment future recruitment cycles with care taken to not disadvantage applicants, who rely heavily on the interview process to create personal connections with programs.","Hamade, Nour; Bhavsar-Burke, Indira; Jansson-Knodell, Claire; Wani, Sachin; Patel, Swati G; Ehrlich, Adam C; Paine, Elizabeth; Hosseini-Carroll, Pegah; Menard-Katcher, Paul; Fayad, Nabil",Dig. dis. sci,,98
407150,The COVID-19 infodemic,2020,"IMPORTANCE: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges to orthodontic profession by adversely impacting provision of in-office orthodontic care due to prevailing uncertainty around risks pertaining to splatter and 'aerosol-generating procedures' (AGPs). This review aims to provide an insight into the prevailing and emerging evidence informing potential risks related to splatter and AGPs, and risk mitigation strategies employed for reducing the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from dental bioaerosols. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, LILACS, WHO COVID-19 databases and preprint databases were searched for eligible English language publications. Citation chasing was undertaken up until the review date of 4 January 2021. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was undertaken independently in duplicate, or else by consultation with a third author. RESULTS: Following filter application and duplicates removed, a total of 13 articles assessing procedural mitigation measures were included. Seven included studies revealed overall low-risk of bias. The overall risk varied from unclear to high for rest of the studies, with the most concerning domains being blinding of the participants and the personnel and blinding of the outcome assessors. Accumulated consensual evidence points towards the use of dental suction devices with wide bore aspirating tips as effective procedural mitigation strategies. Variations in the literature can be observed concerning aerosol transmission associated with water spray use during debonding. Emerging direct evidence consistently supports adjunctive use of pre-procedural povidone-iodine mouthrinse to mitigate direct transmission risk in the orthodontic practice. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough risk assessment concerning AGPs and implementation of consistent and evidence-based procedural mitigation strategies may play an indispensable role in navigating optimal orthodontic practice through unforeseen similar pandemic threats. High-quality robust research focussing on more biologically relevant models of dental bioaerosols in orthodontic settings is warranted.","Singh, Harpreet; Maurya, Raj Kumar; Sharma, Poonam; Kapoor, Pranav; Mittal, Tanmay",Int. orthod,,98

Despite often being slow growing, they can lead to significant gastrointestinal complications including intestinal failure (IF). The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in neoplastic conditions is rising, primarily for palliation and bridging through treatments for cancer, but remains a challenging decision with a paucity of high-grade evidence-based guidance. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with NET on HPN was performed. Data collected included the cause of IF, complications encountered with HPN and changes in nutritional assessments. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified, all with metastatic NET. Median weight improved following HPN commencement and line sepsis was the sole complication. All patients had stabilisation and optimisation of nutritional and hydration status. CONCLUSIONS: HPN is commenced to improve or maintain patients' nutritional status during often lifelong treatment. The principle aim in providing HPN was to improve survival and quality of life. While NETs are cancers, our case series demonstrates the potential of HPN to actively support longer term survival in the subgroup of patients who develop IF.","Sagar, Vandana M; Shah, Tahir; Malhi, Hardip; Parkinson, Sharmalie; Shetty, Shishir; Cooper, Sheldon C",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,98

Using a high-density transposon screen in the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we find that the bacterium requires amino acid biosynthesis pathways to colonize conventionally raised mice, but not germ-free or antibiotic-treated animals. These metabolic pathways are induced during infection by the presence of the gut microbiota. Reduced amounts of amino acids are found in the guts of conventionally raised mice compared with germ-free animals. Dietary administration of high protein increases amino acid levels in the gut and promotes pathogen colonization. Thus, the depletion of amino acids by the microbiota limits pathogen colonization, and in turn, the pathogen activates amino acid biosynthesis to expand in the presence of the microbiota.","Caballero-Flores, Gustavo; Pickard, Joseph M; Fukuda, Shinji; Inohara, Naohiro; Núñez, Gabriel",Cell host microbe,,98

Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included patients presenting between March 23, 2020 and April 19, 2020. All patients who presented to the emergency department were included as cases. The data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Results: Overall, 1,192 patients (mean 42.57 per day) presented to the ocular emergency department and were included for analysis. The median age of the patients was 35 (Interquartile range, IQR: 20-52) years and they were mostly adults (77.85%). The majority of patients were male (62.16%) and presented from the local metropolitan region (56.21%). On triaging based on the ocular disorders at presentation, the majority of the patients were emergency related (65.02%), followed by urgent (8.14%) and routine (26.85%) in nature. The most common emergencies were microbial keratitis (23.74%), followed by corneal trauma (16.39%). There was an increasing trend seen in emergency patients (46.11%; week 1 to 71.78%; week 4) and a decreasing trend seen in routine patients (45%; week1 to 21.20%; week 4). A subset of patients (23.49%) underwent surgery where indicated and the most commonly performed procedures were vitreo-retinal procedures (32.86%) followed by trauma related (31.43%). Conclusion: The enforcement of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 resulted in a fewer patients presenting to the hospital.

The aim of this study was to look at the outcomes of VSC and its role in the post-COVID era. Methods: Prospective outcomes audit was done for all patients referred to the VSC for a 6-year period (March 2014-April 2020). VSC is led by specialist stone nurses for on-going surveillance of KSD patients. Results: A total of 290 patients were seen (468 individual appointments; 1.6 ± 1.0 per patient), with a mean age of 57.0 ± 15.8 years (range: 17-92) and a men-women ratio of 3:2. The referral was for surveillance of asymptomatic small renal stones (230, 79.3%); history of recurrent stone disease (45, 15.5%); solitary kidneys (5, 1.7%); cystine stones; young age; and other conditions (10, 3.4%). The mean stone size was 5.0 ± 2.7 mm, followed up with kidney, ureter, and bladder radiograph (225, 77.6%) and ultrasound scan (USS) (65, 22.4%), for median duration of 12 months (range: 3-24 months). At the end, 132 patients (45.6%) remained in VSC, 106 (36.6%) were discharged, 47 (16.2%) returned to face-to-face clinic or treatment, and 5 (1.7%) had emergency admissions. Of 47 patients who returned, 23 (48.9%) developed new symptoms, 21 (44.6%) had stone growth, and 3 defaulted to face-to-face appointment. Thirty-five patients needed surgical intervention (URS-21, SWL-13, and PCNL-1) and 10 were managed conservatively. VSC reduced the cost per clinic appointment from £27.9 to £2 per patient (93% reduction), equating to a total saving of £12,006 for the study period. Conclusion: Nurse-led VSC not only provided a safe follow-up but also allowed to substantially reduce the cost of treatment by allowing patients to be either discharged or return to a face-to-face clinic or surgical intervention if needed. Post-COVID, this model using telemedicine will have a much wider uptake and further help to optimize health care resources.","Hughes, Thomas; Pietropaolo, Amelia; Archer, Matthew; Davis, Tania; Tear, Loretta; Somani, Bhaskar K",J. endourol,,98

The individuals who go to the workplace during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) process have higher unrealistic relationship expectancy score and total score of interpersonal cognitive distortion. Interpersonal cognitive distortions were determined to explain 5% of task and relationship performance in family role performance. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It was determined that the relationships in the spouses were associated with cognitive distortions and family role performance. Interpersonal cognitive distortions in spouses were found to affect role performance in the family.,"Aydin, Adeviye; Malak Akgün, Bahanur",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,98

419296,Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Genetic Variant rs12252-C Associated With Disease Severity in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Effects of dietary hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora (ZE) on growth performance, plasma and hepatic antioxidant capacities, and humoral and skin mucus immune parameters were evaluated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles. in vitro tests showed that ZE had antioxidant property comparable to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) at 100-200 µg/mL concentrations, although its antioxidant property was lower than BHT at concentration below 100 µg/mL. Moreover, ZE had anti-bacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, which was 30-50% lower than that of tetracycline. After feeding the fish with diets supplemented with 0 (CT, 1 (ZE1), 2 (ZE2), and 3 (ZE3) g/kg ZE for eight weeks, there were no significant differences in growth performance and feed efficiency among the treatments; however, the fish in ZE2 and ZE3 treatments showed significantly higher survival than the fish in CT treatment. Blood leukocyte counts, plasma globulin, total immunoglobulin, lysozyme and bactericidal activity against A. hydrophila in ZE2 and ZE3 groups were significantly higher than that of CT group. All the ZE-treated groups had higher plasma complement activity compared to the CT group. Mucosal lysozyme and bactericidal activities of the ZE2 fish were significantly higher than the other treatments. Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and lysozyme genes increased in head kidney of the fish treated with ZE; the highest increases were related to the ZE2 treatment. Plasma total antioxidant (TA) activities of ZE2 and ZE3 treatments were significantly higher than that of the CT treatment. Plasma and hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities of ZE2 group were significantly higher than the other treatments. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly lower in ZE2 treatment, compared to the other treatments. However, hepatic MDA level of ZE2 treatment was significantly lower than those of the ZE1 and CT treatments. In conclusion, dietary ZE supplementation level of 2 g/kg is suggested for rainbow trout feed supplementation to augment fish survival, antioxidant and immune strength.","Taheri Mirghaed, Ali; Hoseini, Seyyed Morteza; Hoseinifar, Seyed Hossein; Van Doan, Hien",Fish Shellfish Immunol,,98

421822,Health-education to prevent COVID-19 in schoolchildren: a call to action,2020,"The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, plays an important role in host defense and innate immunity due to its broad antibacterial and antiviral properties. Ferritin, an iron storage protein is often associated with iron deficiency, hypoferritinemia, hypoxia, and immune complications, which are all significant concerns for systemic infection in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS) dementia. Serum and post-mortem brain samples were collected from AD, DS and age-matched control subjects. Serum samples were analyzed with ELISA for ferritin, hepcidin and IL-6. Additionally, post-mortem brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemistry for iron-related and inflammatory proteins. A significant increase in serum hepcidin levels was found in DS, compared to controls and AD subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Hepcidin protein was visible in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus, meningeal macrophages and in the astrocytes close to the endothelium of blood vessels. Hepcidin co-localized with IL-6, indicating its anti-inflammatory properties. We found significant correlation between hypoferritinemia and elevated levels of serum hepcidin in AD and DS. Hepcidin can be transported via macrophages and the majority of the vesicular hepcidin enters the brain via a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB). Our findings provide further insight into the molecular implications of the altered iron metabolism in acute inflammation, and can aid towards the development of preventive strategies and novel treatments in the fight against neuroinflammation.","Raha, A.

423415,Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in Australia,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Prior research has reported an increased risk of fatality for patients with cancer, but most studies investigated the risk by comparing cancer to non-cancer patients among COVID-19 infections, where cancer might have contributed to the increased risk. This study is to understand COVID-19's imposed HR of fatality while controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, metastasis status and cancer type. METHODS: We conducted survival analyses of 4606 cancer patients with COVID-19 test results from 16 March to 11 October 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the overall HR of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the HRs of 13 specific cancer types with at least 100 patients using a stratified analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 resulted in an overall HR of 7.76 (95% CI 5.78 to 10.40, p<10-10) by following 4606 patients with cancer for 21 days after the tests. The HR varied among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false discovery rate &#8804;0.02) for melanoma, haematological malignancies, uterine cancer and kidney cancer. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localised versus distant metastasis cancers, those of distant metastases yielded higher overall fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects. DISCUSSION: The results confirmed prior reports for the increased risk of fatality for patients with COVID-19 plus hematological malignancies and demonstrated similar findings of COVID-19 on melanoma, uterine, and kidney cancers. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the heightened risk that COVID-19 imposes on localised and haematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate uninfected patients with cancer promptly, particularly for the cancer types most influenced by COVID-19. Results also suggest the importance of timely care for patients with localised cancer, whether they are infected by COVID-19 or not.","Li, Haiquan; Baldwin, Edwin; Zhang, Xiang; Kenost, Colleen; Luo, Wenting; Calhoun, Elizabeth A; An, Lingling; Bennett, Charles L; Lussier, Yves A",,,98

Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of the immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced in SARS-CoV-2-infected animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral loads in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in almost 100% survival in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus infection using the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). A group of neutrophils that contributes to the uncontrolled pathological damage and onset of COVID-19 was dramatically induced by coronavirus infection. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain anti-viral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and aberrant neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Guo, Qirui; Zhao, Yingchi; Li, Junhong; Liu, Jiangning; Yang, Xiuhong; Guo, Xuefei; Kuang, Ming; Xia, Huawei; Zhang, Zeming; Cao, Lili; Luo, Yujie; Bao, Linlin; Wang, Xiao; Wei, Xuemei; Deng, Wei; Wang, Nan; Chen, Luoying; Chen, Jingxuan; Zhu, Hua; Gao, Ran; Qin, Chuan; Wang, Xiangxi; You, Fuping",Cell Host Microbe,,98

428272,ANCA associated glomerulonephritis in tuberculosis: a paradoxical reaction,2021,"Regional monitoring, reporting and verification of soil organic carbon change occurring in managed cropland are indispensable to support carbon-related policies. Rapidly evolving gridded agronomic models can facilitate these efforts throughout Europe. However, their performance in modelling soil carbon dynamics at regional scale is yet unexplored. Importantly, as such models are often driven by large-scale inputs, they need to be benchmarked against field experiments. We elucidate the level of detail that needs to be incorporated in gridded models to robustly estimate regional soil carbon dynamics in managed cropland, testing the approach for regions in the Czech Republic. We first calibrated the biogeochemical Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model against long-term experiments. Subsequently, we examined the EPIC model within a top-down gridded modelling framework constructed for European agricultural soils from Europe-wide datasets and regional land-use statistics. We explored the top-down, as opposed to a bottom-up, modelling approach for reporting agronomically relevant and verifiable soil carbon dynamics. In comparison with a no-input baseline, the regional EPIC model suggested soil carbon changes (~0.1-0.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) consistent with empirical-based studies for all studied agricultural practices. However, inaccurate soil information, crop management inputs, or inappropriate model calibration may undermine regional modelling of cropland management effect on carbon since each of the three components carry uncertainty (~0.5-1.5 Mg C ha-1 y-1) that is substantially larger than the actual effect of agricultural practices relative to the no-input baseline. Besides, inaccurate soil data obtained from the background datasets biased the simulated carbon trends compared to observations, thus hampering the model's verifiability at the locations of field experiments. Encouragingly, the top-down agricultural management derived from regional land-use statistics proved suitable for the estimation of soil carbon dynamics consistently with actual field practices. Despite sensitivity to biophysical parameters, we found a robust scalability of the soil organic carbon routine for various climatic regions and soil types represented in the Czech experiments. The model performed better than the tier 1 methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which indicates a great potential for improved carbon change modelling over larger political regions.","Balkovic, Juraj; Madaras, Mikulás; Skalský, Rastislav; Folberth, Christian; Smatanová, Michaela; Schmid, Erwin; van der Velde, Marijn; Kraxner, Florian; Obersteiner, Michael",J Environ Manage,,98

432118,COVID-19 in Northeast Bosnia and Herzegovina and patient's length of hospitalization,2021,"BACKGROUND: To maintain curricular integrity in response to COVID-19, nurse educators are increasingly required to transition from traditional (face-to-face) to virtual pedagogy. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this analysis was to compare the HESI scores based on a traditional pedagogy with the HESI scores following implementation of virtual pedagogy during Spring 2020. METHODS: Student (n = 115; 81% female; mean age = 25.71 years) HESI scores were compared after each eight-week session using the Mann Whitney U test, permutation test and Wilcoxon rank test. Logistic regression was used to identify students achieving at least 850. Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between pedagogy and students meeting 850 HESI scores. Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were also compared with Spring 2020 Exit HESI scores. RESULTS: Students from diverse backgrounds (53.9% White; 27.8% Hispanic; 10.4% Asian; 5.2% Black; 1% Unknown) increased (p = 0.022) MHESI scores following virtual pedagogy in Fundamentals, although no difference was found in Maternity (p = 0.311), Psychiatric (p = 0.129) or Medical Surgical Nursing (p = 0.692). Wilcoxon rank test revealed significant differences in MHESI scores in same cohort of students between traditional (Psychiatric) and virtual strategies (Medical-Surgical) (p < 0.01); and traditional (Medical-Surgical) and virtual (Psychiatric) strategies (p = 0.023). White students' MHESI scores were higher than Asian students', as revealed by Logistic regression with no differences based on gender. Spring 2020 and Fall 2019 Exit HESI scores were comparable (p = 0.499). Chi-square analysis revealed no relationship between pedagogy and achieving at least 850 on HESI (&#967;2 = 0.027, p = 0.871). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the exit HESI scores, virtual pedagogy was as effective as traditional pedagogy for maintaining student competency in a community college associate degree nursing program. Future analyses of the effectiveness of virtual pedagogy in meeting curricular outcomes is warranted, regardless of exit degree option.","Moxley, Elizabeth; Saravanan, Anitha; Habtezgi, Desale; Dixon, Larinda; Miller, Janice; Waller, Maureen",Nurse Educ Today,,98
432537,How to manage thromboembolic risk in patient with SARS-CoV-2-related disease in the Emergency Department: A case report of cardiogenic shock due to massive pulmonary embolism,2020,"Vitamin D deficiency significantly correlates with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molecular docking-based virtual screening studies predict that novel vitamin D and related lumisterol hydroxymetabolites are able to bind to the active sites of two SARS-CoV-2 transcription machinery enzymes with high affinity. These enzymes are the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which play important roles in viral replication and establishing infection. Based on predicted binding affinities and specific interactions, we identified 10 vitamin D3 (D3) and lumisterol (L3) analogs as likely binding partners of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and RdRP and, therefore, tested their ability to inhibit these enzymes. Activity measurements demonstrated that 25(OH)L3, 24(OH)L3, and 20(OH)7DHC are the most effective of the hydroxymetabolites tested at inhibiting the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro causing 10%-19% inhibition. These same derivatives as well as other hydroxylumisterols and hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites inhibited RdRP by 50%-60%. Thus, inhibition of these enzymes by vitamin D and lumisterol metabolites may provide a novel approach to hindering the SARS-CoV-2 infection.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Active forms of vitamin D and lumisterol can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery enzymes, which indicates that novel vitamin D and lumisterol metabolites are candidates for antiviral drug research.","Qayyum, Shariq; Mohammad, Taj; Slominski, Radomir M; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz; Tuckey, Robert C; Raman, Chander; Slominski, Andrzej T",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,,98

We examine the incidence of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing compensated chronic liver disease (CLD). METHODS: From 20 Jan 2020 to 7 Feb 2020, we studied 140 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to either Fuyang Second People's Hospital (FYSPH), Anhui or the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (PLAGH) in Beijing, China. Pre-existing CLD includes those with liver cirrhosis assessed by APRI/FIB-4 score and /or ultrasound; NAFLD as identified by either ultrasound or hepatic steatosis index with significant liver fibrosis and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or hepatitis C (CHC) infection. The diagnosis, grading of severity and clinical management of COVID-19 patients complied to the guideline and clinical protocol issued by the China National Health Commission. All patients had liver function test at least twice weekly till discharge with full recovery or death. RESULTS: In total, 3 had liver cirrhosis, 6 patients had CHB, 13 had NAFLD with significant liver fibrosis (one also had CHB). On admission, none had liver decompensation. COVID-19 disease progression was significantly less frequent in non-CLD patients (10/118 8.5%) than CLD patients (13/22 59.1%, p < 0.001). One patient with CLD had acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). CONCLUSION: Disease progression is significantly higher in those COVID-19 patients with CLD as compared to those with no CLD. ACLF can also occur in patient with pre-existing compensated CLD who had severe COVID-19.","Ji, Dong; Zhang, Dawei; Yang, Tieniu; Mu, Jinsong; Zhao, Peng; Xu, Jing; Li, Chen; Cheng, Gregory; Wang, Yudong; Chen, Zhu; Qin, Enqiang; Lau, George",Hepatol Int,,98

Nursing schools all over the world as well as in developing countries responded to the pandemic following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation and different countries specific guidelines regarding the pandemic. AIM: This reflective piece aims to describe the effect of COVID-19 on nursing education in developing countries. RESULT: Face-to-face teaching and learning were converted to virtual remote learning and clinical experiences suspended to protect the students from the pandemic. Specific but broader responses to the pandemic in the Caribbean and other developing countries have been shaped by financial, political and other contextual factors, especially the level of information technology infrastructure development, and the attendant inequities in access to such technology between the rural and urban areas. Internet accessibility, affordability and reliability in certain areas seem to negatively affect the delivery of nursing education during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY: The impact of COVID-19 on nursing education in the Caribbean and other parts of the world has shown that if adequate measures are put in place by the way of disaster preparedness and preplanned mitigation strategies, future crises like COVID-19 will have less impact on nursing education. Therefore, health policymakers and nursing regulatory bodies in the developing countries should put policies in place that will help in responding, coping and recovering quickly from future occurrences.","Agu, Chinwendu F; Stewart, Jodian; McFarlane-Stewart, Nadine; Rae, Tania",Int. nurs. rev,,98

439134,The COVID-19 pandemic: Pathologists support the clinical infectious diseases team,2021,"We assessed the relation between COVID-19 waves in Italy, which was severely affected during the pandemic. We evaluated the hypothesis that a larger impact from the first wave (February-May 2020) predicts a smaller peak during the second wave (September-October 2020), in the absence of local changes in public health interventions and area-specific differences in time trends of environmental parameters. Based on publicly available data on province-specific SARS-CoV-2 infections and both crude and multivariable cubic spline regression models, we found that for provinces with the lowest incidence rates in the first wave, the incidence in the second wave increased roughly in proportion with the incidence in the first wave until an incidence of about 500-600 cases/100,000 in the first wave. Above that value, provinces with higher incidences in the first wave experienced lower incidences in the second wave. It appears that a comparatively high cumulative incidence of infection, even if far below theoretical thresholds required for herd immunity, may provide noticeable protection during the second wave. We speculate that, if real, the mechanism for this pattern could be depletion of most susceptible individuals and of superspreaders in the first wave. A population learning effect regarding cautious behavior could have also contributed. Since no area-specific variation of the national policy against the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was allowed until early November 2020, neither individual behaviors nor established or purported environmental risk factors of COVID-19, such as air pollution and meteorological factors, are likely to have confounded the inverse trends we observed in infection incidence over time.","Vinceti, Marco; Filippini, Tommaso; Rothman, Kenneth J; Di Federico, Silvia; Orsini, Nicola",Environ Res,,98

This study aims to evaluate the use of open-source data from the epidemic observatory, EpiWATCH, to identify the early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause as a proxy for COVID-19 in Indonesia. Methods: Using open-source data on pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia between 1 November 2019 and 31 March 2020 (extracted from EpiWATCH, an open-source epidemic observatory), a descriptive analysis was performed to identify the trend of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia before official notification of COVID-19 cases. Results: A rise in reports of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Indonesia, starting from late January 2020. There were 304 reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, 30 of which occurred before the identification of the first COVID-19 cases on 2 March 2020. The early signals of pneumonia of unknown cause in Indonesia may indicate possible unrecognized circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before official detection. Discussion: Open-source data may provide rapid, unvalidated information for early detection of outbreaks. Although unvalidated, such information may be used to supplement or trigger investigation and testing. As EpiWATCH sources global information, this methodology can be repeated for other countries within the Western Pacific Region, and for other diseases.","Thamtono, Yoser; Moa, Aye; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",Western Pac Surveill Response J,,98

Incorrect imputation of missing values could lead to a wrong prediction. In this era of big data, when a massive volume of data is generated in every second, and utilization of these data is a major concern to the stakeholders, efficiently handling missing values becomes more important. In this paper, we have proposed a new technique for missing data imputation, which is a hybrid approach of single and multiple imputation techniques. We have proposed an extension of popular Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) algorithm in two variations to impute categorical and numeric data. We have also implemented twelve existing algorithms to impute binary, ordinal, and numeric missing values. We have collected sixty-five thousand real health records from different hospitals and diagnostic centers of Bangladesh, maintaining the privacy of data. We have also collected three public datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, ETH Zurich, and Kaggle. We have compared the performance of our proposed algorithms with existing algorithms using these datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves 20% higher F-measure for binary data imputation and 11% less error for numeric data imputations than its competitors with similar execution time.","Khan, Shahidul Islam; Hoque, Abu Sayed Md Latiful",J.

445802,"Undoubtedly, kidney transplant recipients have a higher mortality due to COVID-19 disease compared to the general population",2021,"Disgust sensitivity plays a key role in generating and maintaining outgroup biases. To test our hypotheses, we used a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, in which participants were randomly assigned to a disgust induction condition (N = 102) or a non-induction neutral group (N = 92). The induction scenario featured the return of the diaspora to their home country due to COVID-19 concerns. In one scenario, the diaspora lied about the country they arrived from, and in the other, there was no moral transgression. We hypothesized that the effect of disgust sensitivity on dehumanization and aggressive tendencies passed through contamination fear and the moderated mediation model indicated that this indirect effect was stronger for participants in the disgust-induction than in the non-induction group. This effect was found for biological dehumanization and passive aggression outcomes, both related to outgroup bias. Consistent with the role of disgust as a disease-avoidance mechanism, our results suggest that disgust could facilitate stronger outgroup bias in the context of a high health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Luca, Andreea I; Podina, Ioana R; Boian, RareÈ",Curr Psychol,,98

The percentage of total COVID-19 positive patients in the country died from the disease was under 4% in November 2020. Total deaths in England (all-cause) from June to October 2020 were similar to the historic averages. Age was the single most determinator of COVID-19 associated mortality, 50 years or older accounted for 98% of total COVID deaths. Age distribution of COVID-19 associated deaths in 2020 was similar to all-cause mortality age distribution in 2019. There was no significant improvement in the survival rate of COVID-19 patients receiving critical care.

Many of the targeted signaling pathways are also essential in nonmalignant immune cells. The current coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic catalyzed clinical exploration of TKIs in the treatment of the various stages of COVID-19, which are characterized by distinct immune-related complications. Most of the reported effects of TKIs on immune regulation have been explored in vitro, with different class-specific drugs having nonoverlapping target affinities. Moreover, many of the reported in vivo effects are based on artificial animal models or on observations made in symptomatic patients with a hematologic malignancy who often already suffer from disturbed immune regulation. Based on in vitro and clinical observations, we attempt to decipher the impact of the main TKIs approved or in late-stage development for the treatment of hematological malignancies, including inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, BCR-Abl, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ mammalian target of rapamycin, JAK/STAT, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, to provide a rationale for how such inhibitors could modify clinical courses of diseases, such as COVID-19.","Jacobs, Chaja F; Eldering, Eric; Kater, Arnon P",Blood Adv,,98

Methods: The complete lockdown lasted 6 weeks (from March 16 to April 26, 2020), after which the hospital in Bludenz started day surgery again and in Feldkirch the capacity was slowly increased. We compared how oncological and acute operations differed during those 6 weeks to the 6 weeks before lockdown. Results: Our findings show a clear increase in emergency operations for acute cholecystitis (+133%) and acute appendicitis (+157%). While the acute operations increased, some oncological operations decreased, which was especially apparent for oncological colorectal resections (-66%) and oncological lung resections (-43%). Conclusion: This survey shows that due to the increased catchment area, more acute operations were performed and also demonstrated that we were confronted with more advanced stages of those diseases. Furthermore, cancer operations which rely on short-term peripheral diagnostics decreased considerably.","Lechner, Daniel; Tschann, Peter; Girotti, Paolo C N; Königsrainer, Ingmar",Eur Surg,,98

However, little is known about the impact of ethnicity and household size on acquiring infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study, in Leicester (UK), of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 1st March and 28th April 2020. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic, clinical and temporal factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity before/after lockdown. Findings: 971/4051 (24.0%) patients with suspected COVID-19 were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PCR positivity was more common amongst individuals from ethnic minortiy backgrounds than their White counterparts (White 20.0%, South Asian 37.5%, Black 36.1%, Other 32.2%; p<0.001 for all ethnic minority groups vs White). After adjustment, compared to White ethnicity, South Asian (aOR 2.44 95%CI 2.01, 2.97), Black (aOR 2.56 95%CI 1.71, 3.84) and Other (aOR 2.53 95%CI 1.74, 3.70) ethnicities were more likely to test positive, as were those with a larger estimated household size (aOR 1.06 95%CI 1.02, 1.11). We saw increasing proportions of positive tests in the three weeks post-lockdown amongst the ethnic minority , but not the White, cohort. Estimated household size was associated with PCR positivity after, but not before, lockdown (aOR 1.10 95%CI 1.03, 1.16). Interpretation: In individuals presenting with suspected COVID-19, those from ethnic minority communities and larger households had an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Pandemic control measures may have more rapid impact on slowing viral transmission amongst those of White ethnicity compared to ethnic minority groups, Research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities and whether public health interventions have differential effects on individuals from ethnic minority groups.

However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6-11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (April-June 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models. RESULTS: A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale. CONCLUSIONS: During the UK lockdown, children's depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery.","Bignardi, Giacomo; Dalmaijer, Edwin S; Anwyl-Irvine, Alexander L; Smith, Tess A; Siugzdaite, Roma; Uh, Stepheni; Astle, Duncan E",Arch. dis. child,,98

METHODS: Consecutive adult admissions with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this single-centre retrospective UK cohort study. We analysed all electronic clinical observations recorded within 28 days of admission until discharge or occurrence of a serious event, defined as any of the following: initiation of respiratory support, admission to intensive care, initiation of end of life care, or in-hospital death. RESULTS: 133/296 (44.9%) patients experienced at least one serious event. NEWS2 &#8805; 5 heralded the first occurrence of a serious event with sensitivity 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), specificity 0.28 (0.21-0.35), positive predictive value (PPV) 0.53 (0.47-0.59), and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.96 (0.90-1.00).

There is scarce data on rural populations' knowledge of MI, even though they are disadvantaged in access to medical emergency services. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the rural patients' awareness of MI risk factors, symptoms, necessity of calling an ambulance in response to MI symptoms, and its determinants. Materials and Methods: An anonymous and voluntary survey was conducted among 194 patients and their caregivers with median age 68 years at a rural non-public healthcare facility in Poland. R e s u l t s: 60.3% perceive their knowledge of MI as insufficient. Only 26.3% were able to recognise all suggested MI risk factors. 44.8% did not know whether they are at risk of MI. Furthermore, 78% of respondents who had at least three MI risk factors were unaware of being at risk. 45.4% recognised at least three out of four suggested MI symptoms. 76.2% would call an ambulance in response to chest pain suggesting they have MI. Merely 80% were able to provide the emergency phone number. Moreover, among respondents who declared they would not call an ambulance, 38.7% were afraid of in-hospital COVID-19 infection or healthcare system collapse. C o n c l u s i o n s: Rural patients' knowledge of MI risk factors, symptoms, and proper response to them is insufficient. The problem is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

459515,"Lessons learned from the investigation of a COVID-19 cluster in Creil, France: effectiveness of targeting symptomatic cases and conducting contact tracing around them",2021,"IntroductionHigh-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is the mainstay of therapy for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) in severe COVID-19 pneumonia when conventional oxygen therapy is inadequate. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can worsen AHRF, and the use of positive airway pressure (PAP) leads to improvement in these selected patients. Obtaining inpatient sleep testing for qualification of ambulatory PAP therapy is challenging. We report the successful use of home sleep testing (i.e. WatchPAT™) in the hospital setting for a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and undiagnosed severe OSA. Case A 32-year-old woman with medical history of morbid obesity (BMI 51) presented with hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, and chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy infiltrates and consolidations. On admission, she was treated with IV remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, and IV ceftriaxone. Overnight, supplemental oxygen requirements escalated to 10 liters per minute via nasal pendent, and she was transferred to the ICU. Given her body habitus and nocturnal desaturations, co-existing OSA was suspected, and the patient was empirically started on auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with inline oxygen supplementation. This resulted in improvement in her oxygen desaturations, and she was transferred out of the ICU the next day. Subsequently, a portable home sleep apnea test (i.e. WatchPAT™) was performed, showing an elevated AHI of 31.4/hour, and confirming a severe OSA diagnosis. The patient was prescribed home-going CPAP and discharged home without supplemental oxygen. At her two-month follow-up visit, the patient had a residual AHI of 0.3. Discussion In our patient with increased risk for sleep-disordered breathing, CPAP use with inline oxygen supplementation before trial of HFNC stabilized her respiratory status and shortened her intensive care stay. Performing a portable sleep study in the hospital expedited this patient's workup and facilitated the immediate ambulatory treatment of her underlying sleep-disordered breathing. Without initiation of this treatment in the hospital and during her recovery at home, this patient's severe untreated OSA would likely have prolonged her hospital course and negatively influenced her recovery. Portable sleep studies are an accurate tool to diagnose sleep apnea in selected hospitalized patients and lead to earlier treatment initiation compared to outpatient in-lab polysomnography, especially for COVID-19 patients where safety regulations might prohibit their presence in the lab. Utilizing a portable sleep study in the hospital setting for COVID-19 positive patients can be an efficient and effective intervention, as shown in our unique case.","Zhang, Z.; Johnson, K.; Escalante, P.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,98

460678,A butterfly flaps its wings: Extinction of biological experience and the origins of allergy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of COVID-19 related to prevention, coping, and testing of African American residents in under-resourced communities in Alabama. DESIGN: Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS: Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. CONCLUSION: Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes. While addressing the social determinants of health (e.g. income, education, medical trust) would be an effective path by which to diminish health disparities related to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Interventions should focus on downstream determinants, such as those emerging from our study.","Bateman, Lori Brand; Schoenberger, Yu-Mei M; Hansen, Barbara; Osborne, Tiffany N; Okoro, Grace C; Speights, Kimberly M; Fouad, Mona N",Ethn Health,,98

While there are mRNA agents on the horizon as apotential prevention, adefinitive drug therapy is an unmet medical need. The hyperinflammatory response, known as the 'cytokine storm', is chiefly responsible for complications and deaths. The binding of spike-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR4 receptors has been documented in several studies and has been found to play arole in hyperinflammation; hence, there is an interest in TLR4 as apotential drug target.Areas covered: This review discusses the neurological and respiratory complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progresses to examine the role of the 'cytokine storm' and the involvement of TLR4 receptors in these complications. The possibility of using TLR4 modulators to curb the complications are considered and finally, ashort perspective on future potential drug treatments is offered. Various databases were searched including Pub-Med, Google Scholar, and Medline. The search mainly included research articles, meta-analysis, retrospective studies, reports, and systematic reviews.Expert opinion: TLR4 modulators are being investigated in clinical trials for COVID-19. Challenges in terms of structural diversity of the agents, their natural origin, and efficacy demand extensive research.","Kaushik, Dhriti; Bhandari, Ranjana; Kuhad, Anurag",Expert Opin Ther Targets,,98

465674,Providing Guidance During a Global Viral Pandemic for the Care of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies unveiled a relation between the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and obesity. The aims of this multicenter retrospective cohort study were to disentangle the association of BMI and associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted in intensive care for COVID-19, in 21 centers (Europe, Israel, USA) between 02/19/2020 and 05/19/2020. Primary and secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,461 patients were enrolled, median(IQR) age was 64 years (40.9-72.0); 73.2% males; BMI 28.1 kg/m2 (25.4-32.3); 1,080 patients (73.9%) required IMV; the 28-day mortality estimate was 36.1% (95%CI, 33.0-39.5). Adjusted mixed logistic regression model showed a significant linear relation between BMI and IMV: OR 1.27 (95%CI, 1.12-1.45) per 5 kg/m2 . Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant association between BMI and mortality, which was only increased in obesity class III (&#8805;40 kg/m2 ) (HR 1.68 (95%CI 1.06-2.64). CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, we observed a linear association between BMI and the need for IMV, independent of other metabolic risk factors, and a non-linear association between BMI and mortality risk.

Early results of the MonarchE trial investigating the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy indicated a lower recurrence rate in the combination group in a high-risk population of patients with early stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative BC. In contrast, the PALLAS study evaluating adjuvant palbociclib could not confirm these results. Subtle differences in the respective trial populations, a higher discontinuation rate in PALLAS, or substance-specific differences may be responsible. In HER2-positive early stage BC, long-term results of the ADAPT-TP trial support the notion that chemotherapy-free treatment may be possible in a subset of patients with favourable response to HER2-directed therapy without compromising long-term outcome. The phase III IMpassion031 trial evaluated the addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy in triple-negative BC (TNBC). A significant improvement in terms of pathologic complete remission rate was observed but data concerning long-term outcome must be awaited. Final overall survival (OS) analysis of IMpassion130 confirmed the clinically relevant OS improvement observed with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. In contrast, no benefit was observed with the addition of atezolizumab to solvent-based paclitaxel in a similar population. This contradiction is commonly explained by the need for corticosteroid co-medication with conventional paclitaxel, but the exact reason remains poorly understood. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been successfully established in HER2-positive breast cancer; in TNBC, the phase III ASCENT trial compared the ADC sacituzumab govitecan with chemotherapy by physician's choice in pretreated metastatic patients. A significant improvement in terms of progression-free survival and OS was observed rendering this drug a potential novel standard in this patient population.","Bartsch, Rupert",Memo,,98

With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed. Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention. In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern. Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.","Chen, Pan; Zhang, Guiying; Zhan, Yi",J Dermatolog Treat,,98

Unexpectedly, the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract. Altogether, our results confirmed the presence of virus RNA in extra-pulmonary sites.","Chen, Weilie; Lan, Yun; Yuan, Xiaozhen; Deng, Xilong; Li, Yueping; Cai, Xiaoli; Li, Liya; He, Ruiying; Tan, Yizhou; Deng, Xizi; Gao, Ming; Tang, Guofang; Zhao, Lingzhai; Wang, Jinlin; Fan, Qinghong; Wen, Chunyan; Tong, Yuwei; Tang, Yangbo; Hu, Fengyu; Li, Feng; Tang, Xiaoping",Emerg Microbes Infect,,98
472692,Chlamydia (lymphogranuloma venereum) peritonitis in a male patient,2021,"Reactive poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (PPFPA)-grafted surfaces offer a versatile platform to immobilize biomolecules. Here, we utilize PPFPA-grafted surface and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) recognizing J2 antibody to construct a universal virus detection platform with enhanced sensitivity. PPFPA on silicon substrates is prepared, and surface hydrophilicity is modulated by partial substitution of the pentafluorophenyl units with poly(ethylene glycol). Following dsRNA antibody immobilization, the prepared surfaces can distinguish long dsRNAs from single-stranded RNAs of the same length and short dsRNAs. As long dsRNAs are common byproducts of viral transcription/replication, these surfaces can detect the presence of different kinds of viruses without prior knowledge of their genomic sequences. To increase dsRNA detection sensitivity, a two-step method is devised where the captured dsRNAs are visualized with multiple fluorophore-tagged J2 antibodies. We show that the developed platform can differentiate foreign long dsRNAs from cellular dsRNAs and other biomolecules present in the cell lysate. Moreover, when tested against cells infected with hepatitis A or C viruses, both viruses are successfully detected using a single platform. Our study shows that the developed PPFPA platform immobilized with J2 antibody can serve as a primary diagnostic tool to determine the infection status for a wide range of viruses.","Ku, Jayoung; Kim, Sura; Park, Jaemin; Kim, Tae-Shin; Kharbash, Raisa; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Char, Kookheon; Kim, Yoosik; Li, Sheng",Biomacromolecules,,98
472998,Travel health risk perceptions of Chinese international students in Australia - Implications for COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 brought about most unprecedented public health and socio-economic crisis in our lifetime. It affects us all, especially the vulnerable populations, which refugees and migrants often find themselves in. COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Refugees and migrants are potentially at increased risk of contracting diseases, including COVID-19, because they typically live in overcrowded conditions without access to basic sanitation. The ability to access health-care services in humanitarian settings is usually compromised and exacerbated by shortages of medicines and lack of health-care facilities. Moreover, refugees typically face administrative, financial, legal and language barriers to access the health system. Forced migration is at record highs in 2020, with around 70.8 million people around the world being forcibly displaced. The risk of communicating the novel covid 19 increases in case of the refugees because they come from the diverse regions of the world which might be facing a higher risk to lives due to the pandemic. Therefore, the health professionals need to be more vigilant. As the COVID-19 situation around the world changes, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is monitoring COVID-19 risk in each destination and making travel recommendations. Travel Health Notices inform travelers and clinicians about current health issues that impact travelers’ health, like disease outbreaks, special events or gatherings, and natural disasters, in destinations around the world. The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has posed a serious ultimatum to the world of providing proper shelter, asylum and healthcare facilities to the refugees. However, public health professionals, community organizations as World Health Organization (WHO) and UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), resettlement agencies, and healthcare providers can assist refugees arriving in the United States by providing them with information they need to protect themselves from COVID-19.","Grewal, R.; Koul, R.

Using flight data from the WAN, along with a drastically simplified epidemic model, we are able to predict epidemic arrival times, for arbitrary initial conditions, in a computationally efficient manner. Our framework provides some theoretical justification to the `effective distance' originally introduced by Brockmann \&Helbing (2013), however we also observed that the predictive power of such heuristics is significantly lower than previously reported. Further improvements to our framework allow predictions to be made, even in parameter regimes where past methods are known to fail, and illuminate the circumstances under which this class of methods can be expected to fail.","Jamieson-Lane, Alastair; Blasius, Bernd",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05557v1.pdf,98
474104,Broad clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammatory joint disease in adults: a report of 35 cases from the COVID-19 & Autoimmune Systemic Disease Italian study group,2021,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive cognitive, memory, and learning dysfunction that affects the aging population. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) might be beneficial for postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. However, the exact mechanism underlying the protective role of Dex against cognitive impairment requires further elucidation. The present study aims to determine whether miR-129 is involved in the protective effect of Dex against Aß1-42-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis and cognitive impairment in mice. In our study, Y-shaped maze and water maze tests were conducted to evaluate the cognitive function of AD mice, while neuronal apoptosis was measured by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The findings showed that Dex administration resulted in the enhancement of miR-129 expression with declined hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in Aß1-42-injected mice. miR-129 targeted YAP1 and disrupted its interaction with JAG1, leading to a decline in hippocampal neuron apoptosis and attenuated cognitive impairment in Aß1-42-injected mice. In conclusion, the miR-129/YAP1/JAG1 axis could potentially be the mechanism by which Dex protects AD mice from cognitive impairment.","Sun, Weiying; Zhao, Jun; Li, Chunzhi",Mol. Neurobiol,,98

478992,CCR5Δ32 mutations do not determine COVID-19 disease course,2021,"Novel Coronavirus is deadly for humans and animals. The ease of its dispersion, coupled with its tremendous capability for ailment and death in infected people, makes it a risk to society. The chest X-ray is conventional but hard to interpret radiographic test for initial diagnosis of coronavirus from other related infections. It bears a considerable amount of information on physiological and anatomical features. To extract relevant information from it can occasionally become challenging even for a professional radiologist. In this regard, deep-learning models can help in swift, accurate and reliable outcomes. Existing datasets are small and suffer from the balance issue. In this paper, we prepare a relatively larger and well-balanced dataset as compared to the available datasets. Furthermore, we analyze deep learning models, namely, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 with numerous variations such as training the models from scratch, fine-tuning without pre-trained weights, fine-tuning along with updating pre-trained weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with pre-trained weights along with applying augmentation. Our results show that fine-tuning with augmentation generates best results in pre-trained models. Finally, we have made architectural adjustments in MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 models to learn more intricate features, which are then merged in our proposed ensemble model. The performance of our model is statistically analyzed against other models using four different performance metrics with paired two-sided t-test on 5 different splits of training and test sets of our dataset. We find that it is statistically better than its competing methods for the four metrics. Thus, the computer-aided classification based on the proposed model can assist radiologists in identifying coronavirus from other related infections in chest X-rays with higher accuracy. This can help in a reliable and speedy diagnosis, thereby saving valuable lives and mitigating the adverse impact on the socioeconomics of our community.","Ahmad, Fareed; Ghani Khan, Muhammad Usman; Javed, Kashif",Comput Biol Med,,98

479394,Discordant courses of COVID-19 in a cohabiting couple of lung transplant recipients,2020,"PURPOSE: To use a randomized controlled design to explore the effects of evidence-based medicine (EBM) education on physician assistant (PA) students' EBM knowledge, self-efficacy, and evidence-seeking behavior in a simulated clinical situation and to present a model of EBM competence. METHODS: Sixty-one didactic-year PA students from one Midwestern University (2 sequential cohorts) were randomized to receive the standard PA curriculum plus EBM training (intervention) or the standard PA curriculum only (control). Evidence-based medicine knowledge was measured with a validated Fresno test. Self-efficacy was measured with a validated Likert scale. Clinical application of EBM skills was measured with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). RESULTS: Evidence-based medicine education led to significant improvements on the Fresno and self-efficacy tests, both within and between groups. On the OSCE, the intervention group performed no better than the control group. Higher Fresno pretest scores were significantly related to decreasing improvements in the posttest scores: R = -0.634. CONCLUSION: Teaching EBM to PA students improved their EBM knowledge and self-efficacy but not their clinical application. Future research should focus on enhancing EBM evaluation and application in the clinical setting.","Stack, Matthew A; DeLellis, Nailya O; Boeve, Wallace; Satonik, Robert C",J Physician Assist Educ,,98

RESULTS: The proportion of normal chest CT in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were 35.4% (17/48) and 3.3%(2/61), respectively (P< 0.001). In 17 asymptomatic patients, their images of chest CT maintained normal during the whole course of diseases, while the normal images of chest CT in 2 pre-symptomatic patients progressed to abnormal later (P< 0.001). All the six asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection maintained unilateral lesion, while the proportion was 29.4%(5/17) in pre-symptomatic patients(P= 0.003).

482229,Attenuated early inflammatory response in solid organ recipients with COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes respiratory problems similar to those caused by SARS-CoV (2003). Currently, swab samples are being used for its diagnosis. The most common testing method used is the RT-PCR method, which has high specificity but variable sensitivity. AI-based detection has the capability to overcome this drawback. In this paper, we propose a prospective method wherein we use chest CT scans to diagnose the patients for COVID-19 pneumonia. We use a set of open-source images, available as individual CT slices, and full CT scans from a private Indian Hospital to train our model. We build a 2D segmentation model using the U-Net architecture, which gives the output by marking out the region of infection. Our model achieves a sensitivity of 96.428% (95% CI: 88%-100%) and a specificity of 88.39% (95% CI: 82%-94%). Additionally, we derive a logic for converting our slice-level predictions to scan-level, which helps us reduce the false positives.","Lokwani, Rohit; Gaikwad, Ashrika; Kulkarni, Viraj; Pant, Aniruddha; Kharat, Amit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13212v1.pdf,98

487986,A review of prevention and adjuvant therapy in acute respiratory syndrome caused by covid-19 from the perspective of persian medicine,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The worldwide pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to date. Given that some of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are asymptomatic, antibody tests are useful to determine whether there is a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we measured IgM and IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of asymptomatic healthy subjects in The University of Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: From June 2020, we recruited participants, who were students, staff, and faculty members of The University of Tokyo in the project named The University of Tokyo COVID-19 Antibody Titer Survey (UT-CATS). Following blood sample collection, participants were required to answer an online questionnaire about their social and health information. We measured IgG and IgM titers against SARS-CoV-2 using iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection kit which applies a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection. RESULTS: There were 6609 volunteers in this study. After setting the cutoff value at 10 AU/mL, 32 (0.48%) were positive for IgG and 16 (0.24%) for IgM. Of six participants with a history of COVID-19, five were positive for IgG, whereas all were negative for IgM. The median titer of IgG was 0.40 AU/mL and 0.39 AU/mL for IgM. Both IgG and IgM titers were affected by gender, age, smoking status, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Positive rates of IgG and IgM titers were relatively low in our university.

491565,Stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: Perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pregnancy. Methods: Databases (Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched electronically on 6th April and updated regularly until 8th June 2020. Reports of pregnant women with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were included. Meta-analytical proportion summaries and meta-regression analyses for key clinical outcomes are provided. Findings: 86 studies were included, 17 studies (2567 pregnancies) in the quantitative synthesis; other small case series and case reports were used to extract rarely-reported events and outcome. Most women (73.9%) were in the third trimester; 52.4% have delivered, half by caesarean section (48.3%). The proportion of Black, Asian or minority ethnic group membership (50.8%); obesity (38.2%), and chronic co-morbidities (32.5%) were high. The most commonly reported clinical symptoms were fever (63.3%), cough (71.4%) and dyspnoea (34.4%). The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised CRP or procalcitonin (54.0%), lymphopenia (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%). Preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was common (21.8%), usually medically-indicated (18.4%). Maternal intensive care unit admission was required in 7.0%, with intubation in 3.4%. Maternal mortality was uncommon (~1%). Maternal intensive care admission was higher in cohorts with higher rates of co-morbidities (beta=0.007, p<0.05) and maternal age over 35 years (beta=0.007, p<0.01). Maternal mortality was higher in cohorts with higher rates of antiviral drug use (beta=0.03, p<0.001), likely due to residual confounding. Neonatal nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was positive in 1.4%. Interpretation: The risk of iatrogenic preterm birth and caesarean delivery was increased.

We classify the feasibility of working at home for all occupations and merge this classification with occupational employment counts. We find that 37% of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home, with significant variation across cities and industries. These jobs typically pay more than jobs that cannot be done at home and account for 46% of all US wages. Applying our occupational classification to 85 other countries reveals that lower-income economies have a lower share of jobs that can be done at home.","Dingel, Jonathan I.; Neiman, Brent",J.

It is spreading at peak levels since the first case reported and the need for vaccines is in immense demand globally. Numerous treatment and vaccination strategies that were previously employed for other pathogens including coronaviruses are now being been adopted to guide the formulation of new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Several vaccine targets can be utilized for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we highlighted the potential of various antigenic targets and other modes for formulating an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. There are a varying number of challenges encountered during developing the most effective vaccines, and measures for tackling such challenges will assist in fast pace development of vaccines. This review will give a concise overview of various aspects of the vaccine development process against SARS-CoV-2, including 1) potential antigen targets 2) different vaccination strategies from conventional to novel platforms, 3) ongoing clinical trials, 4) varying challenges encountered during developing the most effective vaccine and the futuristic approaches.","Malik, Jonaid Ahmad; Mulla, Almas Hanif; Farooqi, Tahmeena; Pottoo, Faheem Hyder; Anwar, Sirajudheen; Rengasamy, Kannan R R",Biomed Pharmacother,,98
497421,Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines to make a global impact,2021,"Respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza and coronavirus are a serious global problem due to their high infection rates and potential to spark pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although preventing these infections by using vaccines has been the most successful strategy to date, effective vaccines are not always available. Therefore, developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat such infections is essential, especially in the case of immunocompromised patients, or for outbreaks of novel virus strains. Sialic acids have been highlighted as a key molecule in the viral infection cycle, with terminally sialylated glycans acting as a target for several viral proteins involved in infection, particularly respiratory infection. Inhibitors of one such protein, neuraminidase, are the only anti-influenza drugs currently on the market. Problems with neuraminidase inhibitors, including development of resistance and a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, drive the need for an improved understanding of the viral infection cycle and the development of more resilient, broader-spectrum anti-viral treatments. Hence, this review outlines the various roles played by sialic acids in respiratory viral infection and provides examples of drugs that exploit sialic acids to inhibit viral infections. It has been concluded that drugs targeting host cell expression of sialic acid could be especially well suited to inhibiting a broad spectrum of respiratory infections. This warrants the continued design and improvement of such drugs in an attempt to lessen the burden of respiratory infections.","Steele, Harrison; Tague, Andrew J; Skropeta, Danielle",Curr. med. chem,,98

503610,Reporting of Infectious Diseases in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Patients affected with Covid-19 that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, manifest various gastrointestinal and hepatic abnormalities alongside respiratory disorder. The identification of this virus in the feces of more than 50% of infected individuals indicates the possibility of viral shedding and fecal to oral transmission. Preliminary reports have also identified alterations in the intestinal microbiota profile in the infected individuals. Moreover, Covid-19 patients manifest various degrees of liver injury characterized by alterations in liver function enzymes. Interestingly, the manifestation of digestive symptoms and liver abnormalities correlate with disease severity, the incidence of the critical outcome, and the recovery time of the patients. However, the pathogenic mechanisms behind Covid-19 induced abnormalities in the gut-liver axis seem multifactorial in origin. This review compiles the current knowledge sourced from pre-clinical and clinical research and summarizes the various gastrointestinal and hepatic dysfunction observed following infection with Covid-19 virus, and also explores the possible mechanistic link precipitating the abnormalities in the gut-liver axis.

Here, we report FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that utilizes a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleobase and nucleotide sequences without trans-cleavage of reporter molecules. We also demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including heterozygous carriers, and present a simple web-tool JATAYU to aid end-users. FELUDA is semi-quantitative, can adapt to multiple signal detection platforms, and deploy for versatile applications such as molecular diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Employing a lateral flow readout, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all ranges of viral loads in clinical samples within 1hr.

504390,IL-6-based mortality risk model for hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented levels of disruption to the local and regional transportation networks throughout the United States, especially the Motor City: Detroit. That was mainly a result of swift restrictive measures such as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders to confine the spread of the virus. This work is driven by analyzing five types of real-world data sets from Detroit related to traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing index, and crashes from January 2019 to June 2020. The primary goal is figuring out the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation network usage (traffic volume) and safety (crashes) for the Detroit, exploring the potential correlation between these diverse data features, and determining whether each type of data (e.g., traffic volume data) could be a useful factor in the confirmed-cases prediction. In addition, a deep learning model was developed using long short-term memory networks to predict the number of confirmed cases within the next one week. The model demonstrated a promising prediction result with a coefficient of determination (R^2) of up to approximately 0.91. Moreover, in order to provide statistical evaluation measures of confirmed-case prediction and to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data, the prediction results of six feature groups are presented and analyzed. Furthermore, six essential observations with supporting evidence and analyses are presented. The goal of this paper is to present a proposed approach which can be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated for analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on a transportation network and prediction of the anticipated COVID-19 cases using a similar data set obtained for other large cities in the USA or from around the world.","Yao, Yongtao; Geara, Tony G.; Shi, Weisong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12080v1.pdf,98

513318,'Long COVID' syndrome,2021,"Whether children should be vaccinated against COVID-19 (or other infectious diseases such as influenza) and whether some degree of coercion should be exercised by the state to ensure high uptake depends, among other things, on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. For COVID-19 these are currently unknown for children, with unanswered questions also on children's role in transmission of the virus, the extent to which the vaccine will reduce transmission, and the expected benefit (if any) to the child. Ultimately, deciding whether to recommend that children receive a novel vaccine for a disease which is not a major threat to them, or to mandate the vaccine, requires precise information on risks, including disease severity and vaccine safety and effectiveness, and comparative evaluation of the alternatives, and of the levels of coercion associated with each. But the decision also requires balancing self-interest with duty to others, and liberty with utility. Separate to ensuring vaccine supply and access, we outline three requirements for mandatory vaccination from an ethical perspective: (1) whether the disease is a grave threat to the health of children and to public health; (2) positive comparative expected utility of mandatory vaccination and (3) proportionate coercion. We also suggest that the case for mandatory vaccine in children may be strong in the case of influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Savulescu, Julian; Giubilini, Alberto; Danchin, Margie",J. pediatr.

516967,Re: COVID-19 in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: Initial Report from the US Epicenter,2020,"Background QRS duration (QRSd) is a marker of electrical remodeling in heart failure. Anthropometrics and left ventricular size may influence QRSd and, in turn, may influence the association between QRSd and heart failure outcomes. Methods and Results Using the prospective, multicenter, multinational ASIAN-HF (Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) registry, this study evaluated whether electroanatomic ratios (QRSd indexed for height or left ventricular end-diastole volume) are associated with 1-year mortality in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The study included 4899 individuals (aged 60±19 years, 78% male, mean left ventricular ejection fraction: 27.3±7.1%). In the overall cohort, QRSd was not associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.003; 95% CI, 0.999-1.006, P=0.142) or sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.006; 95% CI, 1.000-1.013, P=0.059). QRS/height was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.165; 95% CI, 1.046-1.296, P=0.005 with interaction by sex pinteraction=0.020) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.270; 95% CI, 1.021-1.580, P=0.032). QRS/left ventricular end-diastole volume was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43, P=0.011) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.461; 95% CI, 1.090-1.957, P=0.011) in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy but not in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (all-cause mortality: HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11, P=0.467; sudden cardiac death: HR, 0.734; 95% CI, 0.477-1.132, P=0.162). Conclusions Electroanatomic ratios of QRSd indexed for body size or left ventricular size are associated with mortality in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In particular, increased QRS/height may be a marker of high risk in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and QRS/left ventricular end-diastole volume may further risk stratify individuals with nonischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

A total of 31 inpatients with suspected COVID-19 were identified at our hospital. The depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) mental health self-assessment questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, and overall mental health. Among the patients, 32.3% had symptoms of depression and 19.4% had symptoms of anxiety. Levels of anxiety and fear varied. In comparing the PHQ-9 and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores of suspected and confirmed patients, there was no significant difference in the distribution of severity of anxiety or depression in the 2 groups. The PHQ-9 scores indicated mild depression symptoms in 25.8% of suspected patients, moderate symptoms in 0%, and severe symptoms in 6.5%. Overall, 50% of confirmed patients had symptoms, with 30.8% classified as mild, 15.4% classified as moderate, and 3.8% classified as severe. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores in the group of suspected patients showed that 9.7% had mild symptoms, 0% had moderate symptoms, and 9.7% had severe symptoms. In the group of confirmed patients, 38.4% had symptoms (34.6% mild, 0% moderate, and 3.8% severe). Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms of depression and different total PHQ-9 scores. During the COVID-19 epidemic, suspected and diagnosed patients had different levels of mental health problems. Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms. The performance of suspected patients was higher, but their mental state was more polarized. It may thus be important to monitor the psychological state of suspected patients as early as possible to enable timely interventions that promote psychological rehabilitation.","Chen, Fang; Wang, Xiao-Dong; Zhu, Kan-Kai; Hu, Jian-Bo",Medicine (Baltimore),,98

Cytokine analysis revealed that the level of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in both CoV-CNS and CoV-respiratory tract infection compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the serum level of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly higher in CoV-CNS infection than in CoV-respiratory tract infection. In patients with CoV-CNS infection, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in their cerebrospinal fluid samples than in matched serum samples. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a high incidence of CoV infection in hospitalized children, especially with CNS illness. The characteristic cytokine expression profiles in CoV infection indicate the importance of host immune response in disease progression.","Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Haipeng; Fan, Ruyan; Wen, Bo; Zhang, Jian; Cao, Xiaoying; Wang, Chengwu; Song, Zhanyi; Li, Shuochi; Li, Xiaojie; Lv, Xinjun; Qu, Xiaowang; Huang, Renbin; Liu, Wenpei",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000453066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28103598/,98

Decreased stroke presentations and concern for delays in acute stroke care have been identified. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the timely treatment of patients with thrombolytics at hospitals utilizing telestroke acute stroke services. Methods: Acute stroke consultations seen in 171 hospitals (19 states) via telestroke from December 1, 2019, to June 27, 2020, were extracted from the TeleCare&#8482; database. The consults were divided into pre-COVID and COVID groups (March 15, 2020, start of COVID group). The consults were reviewed for age, sex, hospital, state, date seen, last known normal, arrival time, consult call time, needle time, thrombolytic candidate, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. The total number of consults, median door to needle (DTN) time for emergency department (ED) patients, and call to needle (CTN) time for inpatients were calculated. Results: Pre-COVID, 15,226 stroke consults were evaluated compared with 11,105 in the COVID group, a 27% decrease. Pre-COVID, 1,071 ED patients (7.9%) received thrombolytics and 66 inpatients (4.0%), while COVID, 813 ED patients (8.2%) and 70 inpatients (5.7%). The median DTN time for ED patients pre-COVID was 42 (32, 55) versus 40 (31, 52) in the COVID group, with no statistically significant difference between groups. CTN time pre-COVID was 53 (35, 67) versus 46 (35, 61) in the COVID group, with no statistically significant difference between groups. Conclusions: Telestroke assessments allowed for uninterrupted acute stroke care and treatment stability despite nursing and other resource realignments triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sevilis, Theresa; McDonald, Mark; Avila, Amanda; Heath, Gregory; Gao, Lan; O039,; Brien, Gayle; Zaman, Mohammed; Heller, Adam; Masud, Muhammad; Mowzoon, Nima; Devlin, Thomas",Telemed. j. e. health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265222/; https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0149,98

A proposed strategy for evading immunity during persistent PRRSV infection is by preventing the induction of IFN activity in pigs and/or by blocking the activation of antiviral proteins in permissive cells. IFN-γ mRNA expression was observed in the lymph nodes and lungs of pigs infected with wild-type PRRSV strain SDSU-23983. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with IFN-γ inhibited wild-type (SDSU-23983 P6) and culture-adapted (SDSU-23983 P136) PRRS viruses in a dose-dependent manner and at relatively low concentrations. The effect of IFN-γ on virus replication included reductions in the number of infected cells, virus yield, and RNA content in single cells. Virus replication was partially restored by the addition of 2-aminopurine (2-AP), an inhibitor of dsRNA inducible protein kinase (PKR). The addition of 2-AP also restored the viral RNA content per cell to near normal levels, suggesting that inhibition of viral RNA synthesis was through PKR. The principal difference between P6 and P136 isolates was the recovery of P136 replication with lower concentrations of 2-AP. Immunostaining with anti-PKR antibody showed a redistribution of PKR from the cytoplasm into nucleoli of infected cells.","Rowland, R. R. R.; Robinson, B.; Stefanick, J.; Kim, T.

IVM is metabolized, both in vivo and in vitro, by C-hydroxylation and O-demethylation reactions catalyzed by P450 3A4 as the major enzyme, with a contribution of P450 3A5 and 2C9. In samples from both in vitro and in vivo metabolism, a number of metabolites were detected and as major identified metabolites were 3″-O-demethylated, C4-methyl hydroxylated, C25 isobutyl-/isopropyl-hydroxylated, and products of oxidation reactions. Ivermectin inhibited P450 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and CYP3A4 with IC(50) values ranging from 5.3 μM to no inhibition suggesting that it is no or weak inhibitor of the enzymes. It is suggested that P-gp (MDR1) transporter participate in IVM efflux at low drug concentration with a slow transport rate. At the higher, micromolar concentration range, which saturates MDR1 (P-gp), MRP1, and to a lesser extent, MRP2 and MRP3 participate in IVM transport across physiological barriers. IVM exerts a potent inhibition of P-gp (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), MRP2 (ABCC2), and BCRP1 (ABCG2), and medium to weak inhibition of OATP1B1 (SLC21A6) and OATP1B3 (SLCOB3) transport activity. The metabolic and transport properties of IVM indicate that when IVM is co-administered with other drugs/chemicals that are potent inhibitors/inducers P4503A4 enzyme and of MDR1 (P-gp), BCRP or MRP transporters, or when polymorphisms of the drug transporters and P450 3A4 exist, drug–drug or drug–toxic chemical interactions might result in suboptimal response to the therapy or to toxic effects.","Rendic, Slobodan P.",Arch Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-021-03025-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719007/,98

Participating clinicians completed a survey which included questions adapted from National Institute of Mental Health-Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH-GOCS) and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Clinicians rated clinical features at treatment initiation, just prior to the pandemic, and mid-pandemic (July/August, 2020). Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with attenuation of ERP progress from expected rates in most patients during first several months of the pandemic; clinicians estimated that 38% of their patients had symptoms worsen during the pandemic and 47% estimated that symptoms remained unchanged despite participating in ERP. Those who endured financial distress or were medically at-risk for severe COVID-19 disease had worse ERP course. Adults also had a worse ERP course during than pandemic than youth.

By taking a local food parcel initiative in a small rural township as an ethnographic case study, this article examines why the attempt to mimic government food distribution generated dissatisfaction and tension in the targeted community. At the heart of this argument is the way the local parcel project created ambiguous anticipation regarding the consequences for residents' experience of dignity, as it undermined an established binary understanding of economic dependency. This understanding clearly distinguishes between relationships within the community and those with the government. Proximity and intimacy increased the risk of public humiliation arising from indebtedness, while dependence on the government did not inevitably generate the same anxiety. Agency is identified as a key signifier to understand strategies for upholding dignity in the different relationships. This article examines different stakeholders' spontaneous and creative attempts to control the relational outcome of the distribution. It discusses how narratives about the distribution as a rightful share to the community's wealth emerged among potential recipients in an attempt to negate any notion of personalized reciprocity following the distribution.","Ekeland, Magnus Godvik",Econ Anthropol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541034/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sea2.12224,98

This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and t-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens’ mental health care.","Kim, Young-Jae; Cho, Jeong-Hyung; Kim, E-Sack",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646034/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134910,98

Notably, single-dose treatment with hMS-1 completely protected hDPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from lethal infection with MERS-CoV. Taken together, our data suggest that hMS-1 might be developed as an effective immunotherapeutic agent to treat patients infected with MERS-CoV, particularly in emergent cases.","Qiu, Hongjie; Sun, Shihui; Xiao, He; Feng, Jiannan; Guo, Yan; Tai, Wanbo; Wang, Yufei; Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhou, Yusen",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216301917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312105/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216301917; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.06.003,98

In this project, we aimed to characterize similarities in dysregulated immune pathways between COVID-19 patients and patients with cardiomyopathy, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesized that these similarly dysregulated pathways may be critical to how cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) exacerbate COVID-19. To evaluate immune dysregulation in different diseases, we used four separate datasets, including RNA-sequencing data from human left ventricular cardiac muscle samples of patients with dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy and healthy controls; RNA-sequencing data of whole blood samples from patients with single or recurrent event VTE and healthy controls; RNA-sequencing data of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with and without obstructive CAD; and RNA-sequencing data of platelets from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls. We found similar immune dysregulation profiles between patients with CVDs and COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, cardiomyopathy patients display the most similar immune landscape to COVID-19 patients. Additionally, COVID-19 patients experience greater upregulation of cytokine- and inflammasome-related genes than patients with CVDs. In all, patients with CVDs have a significant overlap of cytokine- and inflammasome-related gene expression profiles with that of COVID-19 patients, possibly explaining their greater vulnerability to severe COVID-19.","Lee, Abby C.; Castaneda, Grant; Li, Wei Tse; Chen, Chengyu; Shende, Neil; Chakladar, Jaideep; Taub, Pam R.; Chang, Eric Y.; Ongkeko, Weg M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071557/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061018,98

Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature.

Vol 106 (2021) P323–328],2021-06-30,"Innate immune responses in general, and type I interferons (T1IFNs) in particular, play an important and often essential role during primary viral infections, by directly combatting the virus and by maximizing the primary adaptive immune response. Several studies have suggested that T1IFNs also contribute very substantially to the secondary (recall) response; they are thought (i) to be required to drive the early attrition of memory T cells, (ii) to support the subsequent expansion of surviving virus-specific memory cells, and (iii) to assist in the suppression and clearance of the infectious agent. However, many of these observations were predicated upon models in which T1IFN signaling was interrupted prior to a primary immune response, raising the possibility that the resulting memory cells might be intrinsically abnormal. We have directly addressed this by using an inducible-Cre model system in which the host remains genetically-intact during the primary response to infection, and in which T1IFN signaling can be effectively ablated prior to secondary viral challenge. We report that, in stark contrast to primary infection, T1IFN signaling is not required during the recall response. IFNαβR-deficient memory CD8(+) and CD4(+) memory T cells undergo attrition and expansion with kinetics that are indistinguishable from those of receptor-sufficient cells. Moreover, even in the absence of functional T1IFN signaling, the host’s immune capacity to rapidly suppress, and then to eradicate, a secondary infection remains intact. Thus, this study shows that T1IFN signaling is dispensable during the recall response to a virus infection. Moreover, two broader implications may be drawn. First, a T cell’s requirement for a cytokine is highly dependent on the cell’s maturation / differentiation status. Consequently, second, these data underscore the importance of evaluating a gene’s impact by modulating its expression or function in a temporally-controllable manner.","Hosking, Martin P.; Flynn, Claudia T.; Whitton, J.

Among frail persons, cancer patients are at high risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: The French prospective cohort ONCOVID-19 enrolled patients with solid or haematological tumour, receiving anticancer treatment and presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. COVID-19 was confirmed through detectable SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR (repeated twice if negative first) and/or specific CT-scan. The study aims to assess the 28-day mortality rate after the first COVID test. RESULTS: From March 1st to May 21st 2020, 23 French cancer centres and hospitals enrolled 1230 cancer patients with suspicion of COVID-19, including 1162 (94.5%) matching the inclusion criteria. We identified 425 (36.6%) COVID-19 positive patients including 155 (13.3%) diagnosed with CT-scan only, while 737 (63.4%) patients were COVID-19 negative.

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after being cleaved by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). In addition to the lung, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, ACE2 is also extensively expressed in endocrine tissues, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Although glucocorticoids could play a central role as immunosuppressants during the cytokine storm, they can have both stimulating and inhibitory effects on immune response, depending on the timing of their administration and their circulating levels. Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) or Cushing’s syndrome (CS) are therefore vulnerable groups in relation to COVID-19. Additionally, patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) could also be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the immunosuppressive state caused by the cancer itself, by secreted glucocorticoids, and by anticancer treatments. This review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on susceptibility to and outcome of COVID-19 in AI, CS and ACC patients and emphasizes potential pathophysiological mechanisms of susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as the management of these patients in case of SARS-CoV-2.

600525,COVID-19–Related Misinformation among Parents of Patients with Pediatric Cancer,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory infection with a high (~35%) mortality rate. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike of MERS-CoV have been shown to be a therapeutic option for treatment of lethal disease. METHODS: We describe the germline diversity and neutralizing activity of 13 potent human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. Biological functions were assessed by live MERS-CoV, pseudotype particle and its variants, and structural basis was also determined by crystallographic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 13 mAbs displaying strong neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, two with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV)1-69-derived heavy chain (named MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33) showed the most potent neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV in vitro. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, and the combination of 2 mAbs demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. The structural basis of MERS-GD27 neutralization and recognition revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into the specific antibody repertoires and the molecular determinants of neutralization during natural MERS-CoV infection in humans. This finding supports additional efforts to design and develop novel therapies to combat MERS-CoV infections in humans.","Niu, Peihua; Zhang, Senyan; Zhou, Panpan; Huang, Baoying; Deng, Yao; Qin, Kun; Wang, Pengfei; Wang, Wenling; Wang, Xinquan; Zhou, Jianfang; Zhang, Linqi; Tan, Wenjie",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846635/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy311,98

Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s).

In the present study, we investigated the exercise frequency and intensity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also current exercise dependency and mood state among non-contact individual, contact individual, and team sports athletes. A total of 1353 athletes from non-contact individual sports athletes (NCISA), contact individual sports athletes (CISA) and team sport athletes (TSA) participated; 45.4% of them were females that completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, former and current exercise patterns, exercise dependency and mood states. NCISA had less exercise frequency than CISA, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and NCISA had less exercise frequency than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding exercise intensity, CISA had higher scores than NCISA and TSA before the COVID-19 pandemic, and CISA had more exercise intensity than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequency and intensity were reduced from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in the three groups, except for TSA intensity. In addition, positive and negative mood states were correlated with exercise dependency. CISA were more discouraged and vigorous than NCISA and TSA, respectively. For NCISA, CISA, and TSA, ordinal regressions separately showed that adherence to quarantine and exercise dependency were better predictors of exercise indexes. Finally, exercise dependency subscales were different among sports, but it was not in exercise dependency itself. Although the decrease in exercise indexes was noticeable, there was no consistent pattern of change in exercise behavior in all sports. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, negative moods were predominant among all athletes. The results discussed are based on exercise nonparticipating, sport type, and affect regulation hypothesis.","Aghababa, Alireza; Badicu, Georgian; Fathirezaie, Zahra; Rohani, Hadi; Nabilpour, Maghsoud; Zamani Sani, Seyed Hojjat; Khodadadeh, Elham",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073668/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children8060438,98

The major viral RNA-binding protein in virions and infected cells was the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50K). A new 140K virus structural protein was identified as a minor RNA-binding protein both in virions and in infected cells. The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M NaCl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus.","Robbins, Susan G.; Frana, Mark F.; McGowan, John J.; Boyle, John F.; Holmest, Kathryn V.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682286903053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682286903053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3083580/,98

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446.

METHODS: To determine the metabolomic profile of circulating plasma from COVID-19 survivors with pulmonary sequelae 3 months after discharge, a random, outcome-stratified case-control sample was analyzed. We enrolled 103 recovered COVID-19 patients as well as 27 healthy donors, and performed pulmonary function tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans, laboratory examinations, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma metabolite profiles of COVID-19 survivors with abnormal pulmonary function were evidently different from those of healthy donors or subjects with normal pulmonary function. These alterations were associated with disease severity and mainly involved amino acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Furthermore, increased levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, prostaglandin E2, arginine, and decreased levels of betain and adenosine were associated with pulmonary CO diffusing capacity and total lung capacity. The global plasma metabolomic profile differed between subjects with abnormal and normal pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: Further metabolite-based analysis may help to identify the mechanisms underlying pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors, and provide potential therapeutic targets in the future.","Xu, Juanjuan; Zhou, Mei; Luo, Ping; Yin, Zhengrong; Wang, Sufei; Liao, Tingting; Yang, Fan; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Dan; Peng, Yi; Geng, Wei; Li, Yunyun; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Jin",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596592/,98

One of the sources of compounds with potential antiviral activity is Traditional Chinese Medicinal (TCM) plants used in China in the supportive treatment of COVID-19. Reynoutria japonica is important part of the Shu Feng Jie Du Granule/Capsule-TCM herbal formula, recommended by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for treatment of patients with H1N1- and H5N9-induced acute lung injury and is also used in China to treat COVID-19, mainly combined with other remedies. In our study, 25 compounds from rhizomes of R. japonica and Reynoutria sachalinensis (related species), were docked into the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Next, 11 of them (vanicoside A, vanicoside B, resveratrol, piceid, emodin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, procyanidin B2, procyanidin C1, procyanidin B2 3,3’-di-O-gallate) as well as extracts and fractions from rhizomes of R. japonica and R. sachalinensis were tested in vitro using a fluorescent peptide substrate. Among the tested phytochemicals the best results were achieved for vanicoside A and vanicoside B with moderate inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, IC(50) = 23.10 µM and 43.59 µM, respectively. The butanol fractions of plants showed the strongest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (IC(50) = 4.031 µg/mL for R. sachalinensis and IC(50) = 7.877 µg/mL for R. japonica). As the main constituents of butanol fractions, besides the phenylpropanoid disaccharide esters (e.g., vanicosides), are highly polymerized procyanidins, we suppose that they could be responsible for their strong inhibitory properties. As inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease could prevent the replication of the virus our research provides data that may explain the beneficial effects of R. japonica on COVID-19 and identify the most active compounds worthy of more extensive research.","Nawrot-Hadzik, Izabela; Zmudzinski, Mikolaj; Matkowski, Adam; Preissner, Robert; Kęsik-Brodacka, Małgorzata; Hadzik, Jakub; Drag, Marcin; Abel, Renata",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451839/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14080742,98

HiP-CT enabled three-dimensional and non-destructive imaging at near-micron resolution in soft tissues at one hundred thousand times the voxel size whilst maintaining the organ’s structure. We applied HiP-CT to image five intact human parenchymal organs: brain, lung, heart, kidney and spleen. These were hierarchically assessed with HiP-CT, providing a structural overview of the whole organ alongside detail of the organ’s individual functional units and cells. The potential applications of HiP-CT were demonstrated through quantification and morphometry of glomeruli in an intact human kidney, and identification of regional changes to the architecture of the air-tissue interface and alveolar morphology in the lung of a deceased COVID-19 patient.

614709,Observations of the global epidemiology of COVID-19 from the prepandemic period using web-based surveillance: a cross-sectional analysis,2020-07-29,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV2) infection has drastically impacted the transplant communities. Remdesivir (RDV) has shown some promising results in coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) albeit with low certainty. Data in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are still lacking. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 57 moderate to severe COVID‐19 positive KTR in a single center who received RDV as a part of COVID‐19 management. No dose adjustments were done. The outcomes were measured as acute kidney injury (AKI) recovery; liver function tests abnormalities; other side effects; graft loss and death. RESULTS: The median (inter‐quartile range) age of presentation was 44 (31‐51) years. The duration from onset of symptoms to RDV initiation was 6 (5‐7) days. Thirty‐two (56%) cases received RDV on the day of admission. Forty‐six (81%) cases were on oxygen support upon initiation of RDV. Thirty‐eight (66.6%) cases had acute kidney injury on admission. The median baseline, admission, and 28‐day follow‐up serum creatinine of the cohort were 1.59 (1.1‐2.1), 2.13 (1.3‐3.1), and 1.58 (1.05‐2.1) mg/dl, respectively. A total of 8(14%) cases died in the study with 1 (1.7%) graft loss. All those cases that died were on oxygen therapy at the time of initiation of RDV. No liver function derangements or any other major adverse events with the drug were reported. CONCLUSION: RDV therapy is safe and clinically feasible in renal transplant recipients as seen in our cohort. Larger clinical registries and randomized clinical trials should be conducted to further explore the efficacy in transplant recipients.","Meshram, Hari S.; Kute, Vivek B.; Patel, Himanshu; Banerjee, Subho; Navadiya, Vijay; Desai, Sudeep; Rizvi, Syed J; Mishra, Vineet; Chauhan, Sanshriti",Transpl Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915006/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13629,98
616250,Type I IFN immunoprofiling in COVID-19 patients,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND: The ferocious global assault of COVID-19 continues. Critically ill patients witnessed significantly higher mortality than severe and moderate ones. Herein, we aim to comprehensively delineate clinical features of COVID-19 and explore risk factors of developing critical disease. METHODS: This is a Mini-national multicenter, retrospective, cohort study involving 2,387 consecutive COVID-19 inpatients that underwent discharge or death between January 27 and March 21, 2020. After quality control, 2,044 COVID-19 inpatients were enrolled. Electronic medical records were collected to identify the risk factors of developing critical COVID-19. FINDINGS: The severity of COVID-19 climbed up straightly with age. Critical group was characterized by higher proportion of dyspnea, systemic organ damage, and long-lasting inflammatory storm. All-cause mortality of critical group was 85•45%, by contrast with 0•58% for severe group and 0•18% for moderate group. Logistic regression revealed that sex was an effect modifier for hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), where hypertension and CHD were risk factors solely in males. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of critical illness associated with hypertension, CHD, tumor, and age ≥ 60 years for male, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), tumor, and age ≥ 60 years for female. INTERPRETATION: We provide comprehensive front-line information about different severity of COVID-19 and insights into different risk factors associated with critical COVID-19 between sexes. These results highlight the significance of dividing risk factors between sexes in clinical and epidemiologic works of COVID-19, and perhaps other coronavirus appearing in future.

The plateau is defined to occur when the rate of deaths is 5% of the maximum rate. Results are presented for South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, UK, Germany, and USA.

Whilst farm businesses face increasing challenges in terms of economic stability and traditional production methods, this paper considers the role of renewable energy production as a form of diversification. The study adopts mixed methods as a means of undertaking an in-depth investigation into the role of renewable energy generation in supporting agribusinesses in Wales. Initially a questionnaire obtained 118 responses from farmers in Wales. Subsequently, 15 follow-up semi-structured interviews with farmers were conducted to further investigate the issues from the initial questionnaire. The theoretical contribution of this paper is a segmentation of farmer businesses which allows for distinctions to be made of different attitudes to off-farm income and the adoption of renewable energy sources. Five farm types were identified, varying in relation to farm characteristics, attitudes to diversification, access to renewable energy and resource allocation. These farm types highlight the need for specific policies towards facilitating the increase in renewable energy along with sustaining farming incomes. Furthermore the research provides valuable information to the farming industry on opportunities in renewable energy production, particularly for farmers and farm businesses who are considering diversification strategies.","Morris, Wyn; Bowen, Robert",J Rural Stud,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016720305386; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100504/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0743016720305386,98

Yet people who use opioids (PWUO) continue to face a number of barriers accessing naloxone, including not knowing where it is available. METHODS: We used data from 173 PWUO from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which is located between Baltimore City and Washington, DC. We assessed the prevalence of recently (past 6 months) receiving naloxone and currently having naloxone, the type(s) of the naloxone kits received, and the perceived ease/difficultly of accessing naloxone. We also assessed participants knowledge of where naloxone was available in the community. RESULTS: One third (35.7%) of participants had recently received naloxone. Most who had received naloxone received two doses (72.1%), nasal naloxone (86.9%), and education about naloxone use (72.1%). Most currently had naloxone in their possession (either on their person or at home; 78.7%). One third (34.4%) believed naloxone was difficult to obtain in their community. Only half (56.7%) knew of multiple locations where they could get naloxone. The health department was the most commonly identified naloxone source (58.0%). Identifying multiple sources of naloxone was associated with being more likely to perceive that naloxone is easy to access. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that additional public health efforts are needed to make PWUO aware of the range of sources of naloxone in their communities in order to ensure easy and continued naloxone access to PWUO.","Schneider, Kristin E.; Urquhart, Glenna J.; Rouhani, Saba; Park, Ju Nyeong; Morris, Miles; Allen, Sean T.; Sherman, Susan G.",Harm Reduct J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00466-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910565/,98

In many countries, outpatient clinics were cancelled, and the use of telemedicine visits was increased. For urological complaints, the need to perform a sensitive clinical examination via telemedicine posed an unfamiliar environment. Our aim is to explore the clinical and ethical factors involved in performing remote sensitive clinical examinations. METHODS: A comprehensive review of literature and guidance from various medical bodies internationally was conducted using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Research Gate in the first week of March 2021 including “COVID-19,” “telemedicine,” “urology,” and “sensitive examinations.” RESULTS: Telemedicine reduced unnecessary visits to medical facilities and was useful for reducing the risk of transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose that in order to perform a sensitive clinical examination via telemedicine, the following four steps must be considered: assessment of the clinical need, obtaining informed consent, use of a chaperone, and thorough documentation. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine will play a pivotal role in the future of urological practice beyond this present pandemic. However, sensitive clinical examinations using such technology must be performed in appropriate settings and situations.

The structure of this “X” domain, seen in many single-stranded RNA viruses, reveals a three-layered α/β/α core with a macro-H2A-like fold. The putative active site is a solvent-exposed cleft that is conserved in its three structural homologs, yeast Ymx7, Archeoglobus fulgidus AF1521, and Er58 from E. coli. Its sequence is similar to yeast YBR022W (also known as Poa1P), a known phosphatase that acts on ADP-ribose-1″-phosphate (Appr-1″-p). The SARS nsP3 domain readily removes the 1″ phosphate group from Appr-1″-p in in vitro assays, confirming its phosphatase activity. Sequence and structure comparison of all known macro-H2A domains combined with available functional data suggests that proteins of this superfamily form an emerging group of nucleotide phosphatases that dephosphorylate Appr-1″-p.","Saikatendu, Kumar Singh; Joseph, Jeremiah S.; Subramanian, Vanitha; Clayton, Tom; Griffith, Mark; Moy, Kin; Velasquez, Jeffrey; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Buchmeier, Michael J.; Stevens, Raymond C.; Kuhn, Peter",Structure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212605003138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212605003138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16271890/,98

Purified viral particles were spherical in shape and measured 90 nm in average diameter in negatively stained preparations. Pleomorphic forms were also present. The virions had envelopes with petal-shaped projections characteristic of coronaviruses. In ultrathin sections, cores in viral factories were round with a diameter of 50–60 nm. Most of these cores were electron dense but some had an electron-lucent center. In cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, and on the apical plasmalemma of intestinal epithelial cells, the virions were round or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring 70–80 nm in diameter, and had fine thread-like projections on their surfaces. Uptake of virus occurred through fusion of viral envelopes with the plasmalemma of the microvillous border or by entry into intercellular spaces and interaction with the lateral cell membranes of adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. As a result of this interaction, the lateral cell membranes became altered and ill-defined. During the early stage of infection, the rough andasmooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum became distended with electron-dense granulofibrillar material. This material accumulated subsequently as well-defined, smooth membrane-bound areas mainly in the apical cytoplasm of infected cells. These structures were considered to be viral factories. The morphogenesis of virus occurred mainly through condensation of the electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material into viral cores in cytoplasmic viral factories or within the distended cisternes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Viral envelopment occurred on membranes of cytoplasmic vacuoles, Golgi vesicles, or in association with membranes of viral factories. Release of virus from infected cells occurred by lysis and fragmentation of the apical plasmalemma and flow of the cytoplasm with its contents into the gut lumen. Release also occurred by digestion and lysis of extruded infected cells or by fusion of virus-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the apical plasmalemma and liberation of their contents.","Doughri, A.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189,98

The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the clinical outcome of patients receiving in-hospital high-dose bolus cholecalciferol. Patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and overt COVID-19, hospitalized from 15 March to 20 April 2020, were considered. Based on clinical characteristics, they were supplemented (or not) with 400,000 IU bolus oral cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and the composite outcome (transfer to intensive care unit; ICU and/or death) was recorded. Ninety-one patients (aged 74 ± 13 years) with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Fifty (54.9%) patients presented with two or more comorbid diseases. Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67–0.87, p < 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 ± 10 days), 27 (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.","Giannini, Sandro; Passeri, Giovanni; Tripepi, Giovanni; Sella, Stefania; Fusaro, Maria; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Torres, Marco Onofrio; Michielin, Alberto; Prandini, Tancredi; Baffa, Valeria; Aghi, Andrea; Egan, Colin Gerard; Brigo, Martina; Zaninotto, Martina; Plebani, Mario; Vettor, Roberto; Fioretto, Paola; Rossini, Maurizio; Vignali, Alessandro; Fabris, Fabrizio; Bertoldo, Francesco",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13010219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466642/,98

Platelet activating factor (paf) is supposed to be one of the most important mediators. The primary risk factor for nec is prematurity. Other factors include infection, bowel ischemia and exposition of the premature bowel to enteral feedings. nec is mostly seen in extremely prematures and prematures with growth retardation (birthweight less than 10th percentile). nec is known for its serious course. About 30% of the patients die during the course of the disease. Different strategies to prevent nec are still unsatisfactory to eliminate nec.

The crude extract was purified by cation and anion exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Its molecular weight was 27 kDa by SDS‐PAGE and it was named PM27. PM27 was found to inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells stimulated with Con A as effectively as did the crude extract; however, its activity was lost after heating to 100°C for 20 min. PM27 did not directly inhibit proliferation of HT‐2 cells, which are an IL‐2‐dependent T cell line, nor did it modify IL‐2 production by Con A‐stimulated mouse spleen cells. The N‐terminal amino acid sequence of PM27 was determined and BLAST analysis revealed its identity to uridine phosphorylase (UPase) from P. multocida. UPase gene from P. multocida Dainai‐1 was cloned into expression vector pQE‐60 in Escherichia coli XL‐1 Blue. Recombinant UPase (rUPase) tagged with His at the C‐terminal amino acid was purified with Ni affinity chromatography. rUPase was found to inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells stimulated with Con A; however, as was true for PM27, its activity was lost after heating to 100°C for 20 min. Thus, PM27/UPase purified from P. multocida has significant antiproliferative activity against Con A‐stimulated mouse spleen cells and may be a virulence factor.","Tanabe, Taishi; Fukuzawa, Hiroki; Amatatsu, Yuki; Matsui, Keigo; Ohtsuka, Hiromichi; Maeda, Yousuke; Sato, Hisaaki",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209918/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12720,98

Analysis of data by Chi-squared, ANOVA, multiple regression and negative control test or case to case for vaccine effectiveness assessment in primary care and SHLCI respectively. RESULTS: Moderate-high intensity and early onset season with predominance of influenza B virus (IVB) (63%) followed by an increase of circulation of influenza A virus (IVA). A total of 419 IV from primary care samples. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in primary care setting was 14% (95%CI: 0–47%). 1306 severe cases (adjusted cumulative incidence 18.54/100,000 inhabitants (95%CI: 17.54–19.55)). The highest proportion of severe cases were in the >64 (65.1%) (aOR 15.70; 95%CI: 12.06–20.46; p < 0.001) followed by 45–64 yo (25.4%) (aOR 6.03; 95%CI: 4.57–7.97). VE in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 35% (95%CI: 10–54%). Final outcome death while hospitalized occurred in 175 SHLCI cases with a case fatality rate of 13.4%. CONCLUSIONS: 2017–2018 influenza season was an unusual epidemic season with an early onset, great predominance of influenza B (Yamagata strain) virus with a high hospitalization rate of severe cases among elderly stressing the need to upgrade vaccine uptake in this age group.","Basile, L.; Torner, N.; Martínez, A.; Mosquera, M.M.; Marcos, M.A.; Jane, M.",Vacunas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288701/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1576988719301323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2019.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1576988719301323,98
620971,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preparedness in a Thai International School: Emotional health and infection control practices,2021-05-21,"OBJECTIVES: Since the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in Korea was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, 30 patients were diagnosed until February 17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient’ symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.","Choi, Sunhwa; Ki, Moran",Epidemiol Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164053/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020011,98

Despite this knowledge, there is a concern that a number of patients are still not included in the direct care pathway. The study aim was to provide an updated overview of discharge to rehabilitation following acute care and identify factors associated with the direct pathway. We analyzed data from the Oslo TBI Registry—Neurosurgery over a five-year period (2015–2019) and included 1724 adults with intracranial injuries. We described the patient population and applied multivariable logistic regression to investigate factors associated with the probability of entering the direct pathway. In total, 289 patients followed the direct pathway. For patients with moderate–severe TBI, the proportion increased from 22% to 35% during the study period. Significant predictors were younger age, low preinjury comorbidities, moderate–severe TBI and disability due to TBI at the time of discharge. In patients aged 18–29 years, 53% followed the direct pathway, in contrast to 10% of patients aged 65–79 years (moderate–severe TBI). This study highlights the need for further emphasis on entering the direct pathway to rehabilitation, particularly for patients aged >64 years.","Tverdal, Cathrine; Andelic, Nada; Helseth, Eirik; Brunborg, Cathrine; Rønning, Pål; Hellstrøm, Torgeir; Røe, Cecilie; Aarhus, Mads",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441872/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10163577,98

Besides organ failure and sepsis, infection can trigger acute and chronic graft rejection which increases mortality. Medical prophylaxis and treatment are based on comprehensive diagnostic work-up including previous history of infection and airway colonisation to reduce long-term complications and mortality. Common bacterial pathogens include Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, whilst Aspergillus and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) are respectively the commonest fungal and viral pathogens. Clinical symptoms can be various in lung transplant recipients presenting an asymptomatic to severe progress. Regular control of infection parameters, daily lung function testing and lifelong follow-up in a specialist transplant centre are mandatory for early detection of bacterial, viral and fungal infections. After transplantation each patient receives intensive training with rules of conduct concerning preventive behaviour and to recognize early signs of post transplant complications. Early detection of infection and complications are important goals to reduce major complications after lung transplantation.","Clajus, Carolina; Blasi, Francesco; Welte, Tobias; Greer, Mark; Fuehner, Thomas; Mantero, Marco",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038552/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553914000844; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2014.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553914000844,98

As main antigenic determinant, S protein is in focus of antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Besides particle-cell fusion, S mediates fusion between infected and uninfected cells resulting in syncytia formation. Here we present quantitative assay systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split β-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion, in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively prevented by antibodies.","Theuerkauf, Samuel A.; Michels, Alexander; Riechert, Vanessa; Maier, Thorsten J.; Flory, Egbert; Cichutek, Klaus; Buchholz, Christian J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340604,98

A purposeful sample of healthcare providers (n = 23) caring for patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic was recruited to participate in interviews via snowball sampling and an information systems‐supported recruiting process (e‐recruiting). Thematic analysis revealed four themes: (1) Managing isolation, fear, and increased anxiety; (2) adapting to changes in healthcare practice and policy; (3) addressing emotional and physical needs of patients and their families; and (4) navigating evolving workplace safety. New evidence was introduced about nurses practicing outside their usual role. Nurses and other healthcare providers consistently reported increased anxiety during the pandemic.

However, mimicking platelets for in vivo artificial coagulation is still a great challenge due to the complexity of the process. Here, we design platelet-like nanoparticles (pNPs) based on self-assembled peptides that initiate coagulation and form clots in blood vessels. The pNPs first bind specifically to a membrane glycoprotein (i.e., CD105) overexpressed on angiogenetic endothelial cells in the tumor site and simultaneously transform into activated platelet-like nanofibers (apNFs) through ligand-receptor interactions. Next, the apNFs expose more binding sites and recruit and activate additional pNPs, forming artificial clots in both phantom and animal models. The pNPs are proven to be safe in mice without systemic coagulation.

Although food value chains and allied activities were exempted from the lockdown, there were widespread disruptions in food access and availability. Using two panel-datasets, we distinguish the pandemic's impact on non-staples versus staples in relation to household food availability and women’s diet diversity at the national, state, and district levels in four economically backward districts of Uttar Pradesh (Maharajganj), Bihar (Munger), and Odisha (Kandhamal and Kalahandi). Both the primary and secondary data indicate a decline in household food expenditures and women’s dietary diversity in May 2020 compared to May 2019, particularly for non-staples like meats, eggs, vegetables and fruits. This occurred despite special PDS, direct benefit transfer, and ration from aanganwadis rations reaching 80%, 50%, and 30% of surveyed households, respectively. While national and state-level expenditures recovered to the pre-lockdown levels by June 2020, the district-level expenditures did not recover. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence of women's disproportionate vulnerability to economic shocks, the impact of a staple grain focused safety net program, and restricted markets on the access and availability of diverse nutritious foods. This paper makes a case for policy reforms towards PDS diversification to include nutrition-rich foods and market reforms to remove supply-side bottlenecks and expansion of direct benefit transfers for healthy food access. We also highlight the importance of gender-responsive safety nets and their increased coverage for improving intrahousehold nutritional disadvantages.","Gupta, Soumya; Seth, Payal; Abraham, Mathew; Pingali, Prabhu",Econ Polit,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40888-021-00233-9,98

Anticipatory planning for birth rates is important for health care systems and government agencies to accurately estimate size of economy and model working and/or aging populations. OBJECTIVE: To use projection modeling based on electronic health care records in a large US university medical center to estimate changes in pregnancy and birth rates prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic societal lockdowns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included all pregnancy episodes within a single US academic health care system retrospectively from 2017 and modeled prospectively to 2021. Data were analyzed September 2021. EXPOSURES: Pre– and post–COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was number of new pregnancy episodes initiated within the health care system and use of those episodes to project birth volumes. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the degree to which COVID-19 societal changes may have factored into pregnancy episode volume. Potential reasons for the changes in volumes were compared with historical pregnancy volumes, including delays in starting prenatal care, interruptions in reproductive endocrinology and infertility services, and preterm birth rates. RESULTS: This cohort study documented a steadily increasing number of pregnancy episodes over the study period, from 4100 pregnancies in 2017 to 4620 in 2020 (28 284 total pregnancies; median maternal [interquartile range] age, 30 [27-34] years; 18 728 [66.2%] White women, 3794 [13.4%] Black women; 2177 [7.7%] Asian women). A 14% reduction in pregnancy episode initiation was observed after the societal shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P < .001). This decrease appeared to be due to a decrease in conceptions that followed the March 15 mandated COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown. Prospective modeling of pregnancies currently suggests that a birth volume surge can be anticipated in summer 2021. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study using electronic medical record surveillance found an initial decline in births associated with the COVID-19 pandemic societal changes and an anticipated increase in birth volume. Future studies can further explore how pregnancy episode volume changes can be monitored and birth rates projected in real-time during major societal events.","Stout, Molly J.; Van De Ven, Cosmas J.

Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies. RESULTS: Male sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency. None of these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively common finding in the Sardinian population. The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0–0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8–8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95% CI 2.7–220.6), Pc = 0.024]. CONCLUSION: The data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait. Absence of influenza vaccination could be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.","Littera, Roberto; Campagna, Marcello; Deidda, Silvia; Angioni, Goffredo; Cipri, Selene; Melis, Maurizio; Firinu, Davide; Santus, Simonetta; Lai, Alberto; Porcella, Rita; Lai, Sara; Rassu, Stefania; Scioscia, Rosetta; Meloni, Federico; Schirru, Daniele; Cordeddu, William; Kowalik, Marta Anna; Serra, Maria; Ragatzu, Paola; Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Del Giacco, Stefano; Restivo, Angelo; Deidda, Simona; Orrù, Sandro; Palimodde, Antonella; Perra, Roberto; Orrù, Germano; Conti, Maria; Balestrieri, Cinzia; Serra, Giancarlo; Onali, Simona; Marongiu, Francesco; Perra, Andrea; Chessa, Luchino",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.605688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343579/,98

Other reasons include the risk of transmission of infections, lack of resources, and the scarcity of anesthesiologists due to their diversion to intensive care units to manage COVID-19 patients. However, ECT is an urgent and life-saving measure for patients diagnosed with depression and other severe mental illnesses who have suicidality, catatonia, or require a rapid therapeutic response.

Many countries have embarked on national policy reforms towards this goal, including China. In 2009, the Chinese government launched a new round of healthcare reform towards UHC, aiming to provide universal coverage of basic healthcare by the end of 2020. The year of 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of China’s most recent healthcare reform. Sharing China’s experience is especially timely for other countries pursuing reforms to achieve UHC. This study describes the social, economic and health context in China, and then reviews the overall progress of healthcare reform (1949 to present), with a focus on the most recent (2009) round of healthcare reform. The study comprehensively analyses key reform initiatives and major achievements according to four aspects: health insurance system, drug supply and security system, medical service system and public health service system. Lessons learnt from China may have important implications for other nations, including continued political support, increased health financing and a strong primary healthcare system as basis.","Tao, Wenjuan; Zeng, Zhi; Dang, Haixia; Lu, Bingqing; Chuong, Linh; Yue, Dahai; Wen, Jin; Zhao, Rui; Li, Weimin; Kominski, Gerald F",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32257400/,98
637702,Chilblain-like acral lesions in long COVID-19: management and implications for understanding microangiopathy,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND: Mask use can lead to facial dermatoses due to factors, such as hyperhydration, seborrhea, high humidity caused by sweating, and the occlusive effect of the mask. AIM: We investigated mask-related facial dermatoses in healthcare personnel who, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, had to wear a mask for long hours. METHODS: In this study, healthcare professionals working at Medipol Mega University Hospital since the beginning of the pandemic were screened for facial dermatoses between December 2020 and February 2021 with a dermatological examination and interview. RESULTS: Of the 101 healthcare professionals, 51 (50.5%) were doctors and 50 (49.5%) nurses, and 36 (35.6%) were male and 65 (64.4%) were female. All the participants had been actively working at the hospital for 35-46 weeks since the beginning of the pandemic and wearing N95 or surgical masks for an average of 6-13 h a day. During the dermatological examination, the most common facial dermatosis was acne, which was observed in 55.4% (n = 56) of the cases. Of the 56 acne cases, 41.1% (n = 23) had acne in their history, while 58.9% (n = 33) had new-onset acne. Being female, using a N95 surgical mask compared to surgical mask, and the daily average duration of mask use were determined as risk factors for acne development due to mask use. CONCLUSIONS: The use of masks, more frequently N95, caused both an increase in existing acne and the development of new acne.","Altun, Ece; Topaloglu Demir, Filiz",J. cosmet. dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450685/,98

Candidates for repurposing include drugs that target COVID‐19 pathobiology, including agents that alter angiotensin signaling. Recent data indicate that key findings in COVID‐19 patients include thrombosis and endothelitis. Activation of PAR1 (Proteinase‐activated receptor 1), in particular by the serine protease thrombin, is a critical element in platelet aggregation and coagulation. PAR1 activation also impacts on the actions of other cell types involved in COVID‐19 pathobiology, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. Vorapaxar is an approved inhibitor of PAR1, used for treatment of patients with myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease. Here, we discuss evidence implying a possible beneficial role for vorapaxar in the treatment of COVID‐19 patients and in addition, other as‐yet non‐approved antagonists of PAR1 and PAR4.","Sriram, Krishna; Insel, Paul A.",Br J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639031/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15194,98

Although seroconversion to hCoV is near ubiquitous during childhood, little is known about hCoV‐specific T‐cell memory in adults. METHODS: We quantified CD4 T‐cell and antibody responses to hCoV spike antigens in 42 SARS‐CoV‐2‐uninfected individuals. Antigen‐specific memory T cells and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cells were identified using an activation‐induced marker assay and characterised for memory phenotype and chemokine receptor expression. RESULTS: T‐cell responses were widespread within conventional memory and cTFH compartments but did not correlate with IgG titres. SARS‐CoV‐2 cross‐reactive T cells were observed in 48% of participants and correlated with HKU1 memory. hCoV‐specific T cells exhibited a CCR6(+) central memory phenotype in the blood, but were enriched for frequency and CXCR3 expression in human lung‐draining lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Overall, hCoV‐specific humoral and cellular memory are independently maintained, with a shared phenotype existing among coronavirus‐specific CD4 T cells. This understanding of endemic coronavirus immunity provides insight into the homeostatic maintenance of immune responses that are likely to be critical components of protection against SARS‐CoV‐2.","Tan, Hyon‐Xhi; Lee, Wen Shi; Wragg, Kathleen M; Nelson, Christina; Esterbauer, Robyn; Kelly, Hannah G; Amarasena, Thakshila; Jones, Robert; Starkey, Graham; Wang, Bao Zhong; Yoshino, Osamu; Tiang, Thomas; Grayson, Michael Lindsay; Opdam, Helen; D'Costa, Rohit; Vago, Angela; Mackay, Laura K; Gordon, Claire L; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J; Juno, Jennifer A",Clin Transl Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747512/,98
638069,Changes in prevalence of nosocomial infection pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic from a tertiary Hospital in China,2021-07-20,"The Coronaviridae family, an enveloped RNA virus family, and, more particularly, human coronaviruses (HCoV), were historically known to be responsible for a large portion of common colds and other upper respiratory tract infections. HCoV are now known to be involved in more serious respiratory diseases, i.e. bronchitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia, especially in young children and neonates, elderly people and immunosuppressed patients. They have also been involved in nosocomial viral infections. In 2002–2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV); led to a new awareness of the medical importance of the Coronaviridae family. This pathogen, responsible for an emerging disease in humans, with high risk of fatal outcome; underline the pressing need for new approaches to the management of the infection, and primarily to its prevention. Another interesting feature of coronaviruses is their potential environmental resistance, despite the accepted fragility of enveloped viruses. Indeed, several studies have described the ability of HCoVs (i.e. HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43 (also known as betacoronavirus 1), NL63, HKU1 or SARS-CoV) to survive in different environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity), on different supports found in hospital settings such as aluminum, sterile sponges or latex surgical gloves or in biological fluids. Finally, taking into account the persisting lack of specific antiviral treatments (there is, in fact, no specific treatment available to fight coronaviruses infections), the Coronaviridae specificities (i.e. pathogenicity, potential environmental resistance) make them a challenging model for the development of efficient means of prevention, as an adapted antisepsis-disinfection, to prevent the environmental spread of such infective agents. This review will summarize current knowledge on the capacity of human coronaviruses to survive in the environment and the efficacy of well-known antiseptic-disinfectants against them, with particular focus on the development of new methodologies to evaluate the activity of new antiseptic-disinfectants on viruses.","Geller, Chloé; Varbanov, Mihayl; Duval, Raphaël E.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v4113044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202515/,98

641623,Involving antimicrobial stewardship programs in COVID-19 response efforts: All hands on deck,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: Patient participation in decision-making has become a hallmark of responsive healthcare systems. Cancer networks in many countries have committed to involving people living with and beyond cancer (PLC) at multiple levels. However, PLC participation in network governance remains highly variable for reasons that are poorly understood. This study aims to share lessons learned regarding mechanisms that enable PLC participation in cancer network governance. METHODS: This multiple case study, using a qualitative approach in a natural setting, was conducted over six years in three local cancer networks within the larger national cancer network in Quebec (Canada), where PLC participation is prescribed by the Cancer Directorate. Data were collected from multiple sources, including individual and focus group interviews (n = 89) with policymakers, managers, clinicians and PLC involved in national and local cancer governance committees. These data were triangulated and iteratively analysed according to a framework based on functions of collaborative governance in the network context. RESULTS: We identify three main mechanisms that enable PLC participation in cancer network governance: (1) consistent emphasis on patient-centred care as a network objective; (2) flexibility, time and support to translate mandated PLC representation into meaningful participation; and (3) recognition of the distinct knowledge of PLC in decision-making. The shared vision of person-centred care facilitates PLC participation. The quality of participation improves through changes in how committee meetings are conducted, and through the establishment of a national committee where PLC can pool their experience, develop skills and establish a common voice on priority issues. PLC knowledge is especially valued around particular challenges such as designing integrated care trajectories and overcoming barriers to accessing care. These three mechanisms interact to enable PLC participation in governance and are activated to varying extents in each local network. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that mandating PLC representation on governance structures is a powerful context element enabling participation, but that it also delineates which governance functions are open to influence from PLC participation. While the activation of mechanisms is context dependent, the insights from this study in Quebec are transferable to cancer networks in other jurisdictions seeking to embed PLC participation in decision-making.

641682,Pseudomonas otitidis bacteraemia in a patient with COPD and recurrent pneumonia: case report and literature review,2021-08-25,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to unprecedented levels of unemployment and financial strain for many Americans. Among the individuals impacted by financial strain are pregnant women, for whom added financial stress may be particularly impactful due to the costs associated with prenatal care and providing for a newborn. Financial stress has been previously associated with elevated depression symptoms among pregnant women, which could have significant impacts on birth outcomes and long‐term offspring health. However, the impacts of COVID‐19‐associated financial stress on maternal depression in pregnancy has not been investigated. METHODS: Here, we evaluated whether COVID‐19‐associated financial stress was associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score ≥ 15) among pregnant women living in the United States during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data come from an online survey administered to a convenience sample in April 2020 (N = 2099). RESULTS: Forty‐three percent of participants reported experiencing financial stress as a result of the pandemic, while 24% of participants had a clinically significant depression score. COVID‐19‐related financial stress was significantly associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score, even after adjustment for covariates including participant education and income (adjusted Odds Ratio: 2.23, 95% CI = 1.80, 2.77, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Financial stress caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic is associated with more than two times the likelihood of depression during pregnancy, which could impact birth outcomes and long‐term offspring health.","Thayer, Zaneta M.; Gildner, Theresa E.",Am J Hum Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964542/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23508,98

643719,Moving from rhetoric to action: how Africa can use scientific evidence to halt the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-28,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria to improve the therapeutic efficacy and limit the choice of drug-resistant parasites. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of artemisinin-piperaquine (AP) in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria relative to other commonly used ACTs. METHODS: As per the PRISMA guidelines, the EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Google Scholar Library, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched from inception until July 2020 with the following terms: “artemisinin-piperaquine” or “AP.” Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The competing interventions included dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artemether–lumefantrine (AL, Coartem), artesunate-melfloquine (ASAM) and artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ, Artekin). Single-arm clinical trial on AP was also assessed. The reported outcomes, including the overall response, cure rate, fever and parasite clearance time, hematology, biochemistry, electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events, recurrence rate, and sensitivity analyses, were systematically investigated. All data were analyzed using the Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were reviewed, including five RCTs and two single-arm studies. A pooled analysis of 5 RCTs (n = 772) revealed a comparable efficacy on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed cure rate between AP and competing interventions in treating uncomplicated malaria. As for the fever and parasite clearance time, due to the lack of complete data in some studies, only 3 studies’ data could be used. The patients showed good tolerance to all drugs, and some side-effects (such as headache, anoxia, vomiting, nausea, and dizziness) were reported for every group, but they were self-limited and showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: AP appeared to show similar efficacy and safety, with a simpler mode of administration and easier compliance when compared with other ACTs used in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Considering that the potential evolution of drug resistance is of a great concern, additional RCTs with high-quality and more rigorous design are warranted to substantiate the efficacy and safety in different populations and epidemiological regions.","Wang, Qi; Zou, Yuanyuan; Pan, Ziyi; Zhang, Hongying; Deng, Changsheng; Yuan, Yueming; Guo, Jiawen; Tang, Yexiao; Julie, Nadia; Wu, Wanting; Li, Guoming; Li, Mingqiang; Tan, Ruixiang; Huang, Xinan; Guo, Wenfeng; Li, Changqing; Xu, Qin; Song, Jianping",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.562363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013398/,98

645116,A data-driven model to describe and forecast the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission,2020-07-31,"TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: As we navigate through the Covid pandemic, there is emerging evidence of cardiac injury related to Covid-19 infection such as myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia and pericardial effusion. Studies have associated Covid-19 related cardiac injury with a 5-fold increase in the risk of mechanical ventilation and 14 times higher mortality rate(1). In the presence of cardiac co-morbidities, Covid-19 related all-cause mortality rate increases. We present a case of Covid-19 infection in a patient with Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HCM) intending to discuss its sequelae. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year old male presented to ER with 2 days history of non-productive cough and dyspnea. Six months ago, he was hospitalized for 8 days with respiratory failure secondary to Covid-19 pneumonia. He was treated with remdesivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and dexamethasone. His past history was significant for HCM status post AICD placement, chronic diastolic heart failure with ejection fraction of 55% and hypertension.On presentation, he was hypotensive at 83/50, with a heart rate of 58 and saturation of 94% on room air. His WBC count was elevated at 12.2. Chest x-ray revealed right basal infiltrate with bilateral small pleural effusions. His presentation ECG revealed new onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Covid PCR test was negative. He was admitted to intensive care unit for vasopressor support for management of septic shock secondary to pneumonia.Therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was initiated in view of AF with CHA2DS2VASC score of 3. Echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 55-60%. Significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient consistent with HCM was noted. Due to worsening of bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral thoracocentesis was performed separately draining 650ml of hemorrhagic fluid on the left and 800ml of hemorrhagic fluid on the right. Pleural fluid (PF) analysis was exudative and cytology was negative. Re-accumulation of PF warranted bilateral chest drain placement. PF culture remained negative. Unfortunately, patient had recurrent hypovolemic shock and he opted for comfort care measures. DISCUSSION: ACE2 receptor in the respiratory epithelium serves as the entry portal for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In patients with HCM, there is up-regulation of ACE2 expression causing a 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein in sarcomeres, thereby increasing susceptibility to cardiac complications (2). Our patient in discussion had new onset AF, on the background of HCM. CONCLUSIONS: Reports indicate an increased incidence of cardiac complications in HCM patients with Covid-19 infection such as arrhythmia, as in our patient. AF in the setting of underlying HCM, can be explained by ACE2 protein up-regulation. Physicians managing HCM patients should well be aware of increased risk of such complications.

Statistical significance of CRP median exists between different clinical types and ages. There were 10 deaths and 121 cases have been discharged. The CRP in death group dramatically increased continuously until died, while increased firstly and decreased later in the survivor and survivor in critical type. The categorical regression model also showed that CRP and age had significant coefficient. During the first 15 days from symptom onset, the maximum of CRP ranged between 0.47-53.37 mg/L were related to mild combined with moderate type, ranged 53.84-107.08 mg/L were related to severe type, and 107.42-150.00 mg/L were related to the critical type. Conclusions: CRP showed different distribution feature and existed differences in various ages, clinical types and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The features corresponded with disease progression.","Qu, G.; Huang, G.; Zhang, M.; Yu, H.; Song, X.; Zhu, H.; Chen, L.; Wang, Y.; Pei, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20220160v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.20220160,98
649674,Pneumonia in medical professionals during COVID-19 outbreak in cardiovascular hospital,2020-11-19,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause trivial or fatal disease in humans and in animals. Detection methods for a wide range of CoVs are needed, to understand viral evolution, host range, transmission and maintenance in reservoirs. A new concept, “Multiprobe QPCR”, which uses a balanced mixture of competing discrete non- or moderately degenerated nuclease degradable (TaqMan(®)) probes was employed. It provides a broadly targeted and rational single tube real-time reverse transcription PCR (“NQPCR”) for the generic detection and discovery of CoV. Degenerate primers, previously published, and the new probes, were from a conserved stretch of open reading frame 1b, encoding the replicase. This multiprobe design reduced the degree of probe degeneration, which otherwise decreases the sensitivity, and allowed a preliminary classification of the amplified sequence directly from the QPCR trace. The split probe strategy allowed detection of down to 10 viral nucleic acid equivalents of CoV from all known CoV groups. Evaluation was with reference CoV strains, synthetic targets, human respiratory samples and avian fecal samples. Infectious-Bronchitis-Virus (IBV)-related variants were found in 7 of 35 sample pools, from 100 wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Ducks may spread and harbour CoVs. NQPCR can detect a wide range of CoVs, as illustrated for humans and ducks.","Muradrasoli, Shaman; Mohamed, Nahla; Hornyák, Ákos; Fohlman, Jan; Olsen, Björn; Belák, Sándor; Blomberg, Jonas",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.04.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406168/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409001980; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409001980,98

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1β and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1β or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1β and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1β and IL-6 transcriptional response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Bell, Lucy CK; Meydan, Cem; Kim, Jacob; Foox, Jonathan; Butler, Daniel; Mason, Christopher E.; Shapira, Sagi D.; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pollara, Gabriele",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.202275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299992/,98

Maternal and perinatal outcomes.,2021-06-06,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The infection started as an outbreak of pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan, China. Within a few weeks, it spread across the entire globe resulting in millions of cases and thousands of deaths. While respiratory symptoms and complications are well-defined and can be severe, non-respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have been added to the list of common COVID-19 symptoms. Their prevalence has been increasing, probably due to increased recognition and experience with the pandemic. Furthermore, diarrhea and stool testing may change prevalence and transmission rates due to suspicion for fecal-oral transmission of the COVID-19. Due to this risk, various countries have started testing wastewater and sewage systems to examine its role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among communities. In this review article, we describe the common gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, their prevalence based upon the current literature, and highlight the importance of early recognition and prompt attention. We also note the role of fecal-oral transmission. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these symptoms, the role of medications, and potential contributing factors are also elaborated.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant; Gajendran, Mahesh; Boregowda, Umesha; Mann, Rupinder; Sharma, Neil",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195352/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.588711,98

The virus subsequently spread to most countries worldwide and the World Health Organisation characterised the outbreak a pandemic on March 11 (th) 2020 (WHO, 2020a). Older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020). In March 2020, the Irish Government introduced 'cocooning' as a measure for those over 70 years of age to minimise interactions with others by not leaving their homes (Dept. of Health, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique threats to the health and well-being of older adults. This study aims to explore the longitudinal experiences and beliefs of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will be important for tailoring supports, interventions and public health information for this population. Methods: A longitudinal exploratory qualitative study will be conducted using repeated semi-structured telephone interviews with a convenient sample of older adults recruited from participants of an older adult and family carer stakeholder panel for health services research established by the Ageing Research Centre (ARC) at the University of Limerick and through known older adult contacts of ARC academic members. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a reflexive approach to thematic analysis. Participants will have the opportunity to review and discuss preliminary analysis of the interview data and to co-write / design dissemination materials. Ethics and Dissemination: Ethical approval has been granted by the Faculty of Education and Health Sciences University of Limerick, Research Ethics Committee (2020_03_51_EHS (ER)). Findings will be disseminated through open access journal publications and distribution of lay summaries, a press release and an infographic to organisations of and for older people in Ireland, broadcast and print media.","Robinson, Katie; O'Neill, Aoife; Conneely, Mairead; Morrissey, AnnMarie; Leahy, Siobhan; Meskell, Pauline; Pettigrew, Judi; Galvin, Rose",HRB Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015540/; https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13031.1,98

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe social disruption both from health and economic standpoints. Law enforcement personnel have been significantly involved in helping to face the many difficulties due to the pandemic. Police officers have been subjected to further stress from managing social restrictions imposed by governments to contain the pandemic. The Italian State Police steadily approximate 100,000 people aged 25–65 years: 14 subjects (mean age 43.64 years) died by suicide in 2015, 7 (mean age 47.5 years) in 2016, 13 (mean age 45.62 years) in 2017, 10 (mean age 48.1 years) in 2018, 18 (mean age 46.78 years) in 2019, and 12 (mean age 52 years) in 2020. Our records excluded significant changes in suicide incidence rate within 2015–2020 (till December 2020).

652616,Clinical Outcomes and Independent Risk Factors for 90-Day Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with Respiratory Failure Infected with SARS-CoV-2: A Multicenter Study in Turkish Intensive Care Units,2021,"PURPOSE: In endovascular neurosurgery, the operator often acquires three-dimensional (3D) images of the cerebral vessels. Although workstation reoperation is required in some situations during treatment, it leads to time loss because a sterile condition cannot be maintained and treatment must be temporarily interrupted. Therefore, a workstation reoperating system is required while maintaining the desired sterility. METHODS: A contactless operating interface using Kinect to control 3D images was developed via gesture recognition for endovascular neurosurgery and was applied to a 3D volume rendering technique (VRT) image reconstructed at the workstation. The left-hand movement determines the assigned functions, whereas the right-hand movement is used like a computer mouse to pan and zoom in/out. In addition to the interface, voice commands were used and assigned to digital operations, such as image view changes and mode signal changes. RESULTS: This system was used for the actual endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms and cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The operator and gesture were recognized without any problems. Using voice operation, it was possible to expeditiously set the VRT image back to the reference angle. Furthermore, it was possible to finely adjust gesture operations, including mouse operation, and treatment was completed while maintaining sterile conditions. CONCLUSION: A contactless operating interface was developed by combining the existing workstation system with Kinect and voice recognition software, allowing surgeons to perform a series of operations, which are normally performed in a console room, while maintaining sterile conditions.

654710,COVID-19 in children: the link in the transmission chain,2020-03-25,"The slow pace of global vaccination and the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants suggest recurrent waves of COVID-19 in coming years. Therefore, understanding why deaths from COVID-19 are highly concentrated among older adults is essential for global health. Severe COVID-19 T-cell lymphopenia is more common among older adults, and it entails poor prognosis. Much about the primary etiology of this form of lymphopenia remains unknown, but regardless of its causes, offsetting the decline in T-cell count during SARS-CoV-2 infection demands fast and massive T-cell clonal expansion, which is telomere length (TL)-dependent. We have built a model that captures the effect of age-dependent TL shortening in hematopoietic cells and its effect on T-cell clonal expansion capacity. The model shows that an individual with average hematopoietic cell TL (HCTL) at age twenty years maintains maximal T-cell clonal expansion capacity until the 6th decade of life when this capacity plummets by more than 90% over the next ten years. The collapse coincides with the steep increase in COVID-19 mortality with age. HCTL metrics may thus explain the vulnerability of older adults to COVID-19. That said, the wide inter-individual variation in HCTL across the general population means that some younger adults with inherently short HCTL might be at risk of severe COVID-19 lymphopenia and mortality from the disease.","Anderson, James J.; Susser, Ezra; Arbeev, Konstantin G.; Yashin, Anatoliy I.; Levy, Daniel; Verhulst, Simon; Aviv, Abraham",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268523/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.19.21257474v1?rss=1,98

However, the beneficial effects by interferon-β treatment in MS, although suggested to depend mainly on immunomodulation, might lend support to a viral involvement in the pathogenesis. The human herpesviruses have attracted interest since their recurrent modes of infection share some similarity with the relapsing-remitting course of MS, most members are readily detected within the brain, and several of these viruses may induce demyelination within the central nervous system in human hosts as well as in animal models. Accumulated diagnostic and epidemiological data are compatible with a role for the herpesviruses as possible cofactors rather than etiological agents, and recent studies showing early neuronal damage in MS patients focus attention on the neurotropic α-herpesviruses. Antiviral treatment trials with safe and effective drugs such as valaciclovir offer a possibility of testing the hypotheses concerning herpesviral involvement in MS.","Bergström, Tomas",Antiviral Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354298000679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10321575/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354298000679,98

The goal of this study is to compare the performance of face shields, surgical facemasks, and cloth facemasks for mitigation of droplet transmission during close contact conditions. MethodsA novel test system was developed to simulate droplet transmission during close contact conditions using two breathing headforms (transmitter and receiver) placed 4 feet apart with one producing droplets containing a DNA marker. Sampling coupons were placed throughout the test setup and subsequently analyzed for presence of DNA marker using quantitative PCR. ResultsAll PPE donned on the transmitter headform provided a significant reduction in transmission of DNA marker to the receiver headform: cloth facemask (78.5%), surgical facemask (89.4%), and face shield (96.1%). All PPE resulted in increased contamination of the eye region of the transmitter headform (9,525.4% average for facemasks and 765.8% for the face shield). Only the face shield increased contamination of the neck region (207.4%), with the cloth facemask and surgical facemask resulting in reductions of 85.9% and 90.2%, respectively. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates face shields can provide similar levels of protection against direct droplet exposure compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, all PPE tested resulted in release of particles that contaminated surfaces.

This study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health and living circumstances of precarious migrants in Switzerland and to assess whether those undergoing legal status regularization fared better than undocumented migrants. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April–May 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. Results: Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. Conclusions: The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.","Burton-Jeangros, Claudine; Duvoisin, Aline; Lachat, Sarah; Consoli, Liala; Fakhoury, Julien; Jackson, Yves",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392134/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.596887,98

To investigate the clinical relevance of RSV-A ON1,acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases enrolled to our population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Central Vietnam from January 2010 through December 2012 were studied. Clinical-epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal samples were collected. Multiplex PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses. RSV-positive samples were further tested for subgroups (A/B) and genotypes information by sequencing the G-glycoprotein 2nd hypervariable region. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of RSV-A ON1. A total of 1854 ARI cases were enrolled and 426 (23.0%) of them were RSV-positive. During the study period, RSV-A and B had been co-circulating. NA1 was the predominant RSV-A genotype until the appearance of ON1 in 2012. RSV-related ARI hospitalization incidence significantly increased after the emergence of ON1.

Corticosteroid therapy improved his condition, and CMR performed on hospital day 11 also showed remarkable improvement. Although nivolumab-induced myocarditis is rare, cardiologists should consider it when encountering patients treated with such a drug for malignant disease.","Matsuo, Keisuke; Ishiguro, Takashi; Najama, Takatomo; Shimizu, Yoshihiko; Kobayashi, Yasuhito; Mutou, Makoto",Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118387/; https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.2596-18,98
658844,COVID-19 and Nigeria: Putting the realities in context,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in humans in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and has subsequently spread worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center case series of the seven maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients infected with COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 13 January to 7 April 2020 and a proactive search of potential cases by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: Of 202 HD patients, 7 (3.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Five were diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of compatible symptoms, while two were diagnosed by RT-PCR as a result of screening 197 HD patients without respiratory symptoms by chest CT. Thirteen of 197 patients had positive chest CT features and, of these, 2 (15%) were confirmed to have COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, the most common features at admission were fatigue, fever and diarrhea [5/7 (71%) had all these]. Common laboratory features included lymphocytopenia [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)]. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Four of seven (57%) received oxygen therapy, one (14%) received noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, five (71%) received antiviral and antibacterial drugs, three (43%) recieved glucocorticoid therapy and one (14%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. As the last follow-up, four of the seven patients (57%) had been discharged and three patients were dead. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT may identify COVID-19 patients without clear symptoms, but the specificity is low. The mortality of COVID-19 patients on HD was high.","Wang, Rui; He, Hong; Liao, Cong; Hu, Hongtao; Hu, Chun; Zhang, Juan; Gao, Ping; Wu, Xiaoyan; Cheng, Zhenshun; Liao, Meiyan; Shui, Hua",Clin Kidney J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695322/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfaa086,98

Those who were infected with the virus were under immense psychosocial and physiologic stress. We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of 552 patients who were evaluated by a Henry Ford Health System dermatologist between February 2020 and September 2020 and had a diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection. Ten patients were identified with TE attributed to COVID‐19 infection and described their presentations as a case series. For the ten patients selected, the mean age was 48.5 years old and 90% were female. Six of the patients were Black, one Middle Eastern, and three White. On average, the hair shedding began 50 days after the first symptom of COVID‐19 infection. About 80% of these patients were treated with antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and/or hydroxychloroquine for their COVID‐19 infection and 70% were hospitalized. The presentations of these patients suggest that COVID‐19 infection may be a significant trigger of TE. TE caused by hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or other medications cannot be ruled out, and the global pandemic itself is a source of psychosocial stress. Further studies will be needed to understand the long‐term prevalence and prognosis of TE associated with COVID‐19 infection.","Olds, Hailey; Liu, Jesse; Luk, Kevin; Lim, Henry W.; Ozog, David; Rambhatla, Pranita V.",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33405302/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.14761,98

This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity would predict such behaviour even in the absence of restrictions on social life. We present an agent‐based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population. We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a large number of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, Andreas; Sneppen, Kim",APMIS,https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622024/,98
660687,The association between malaria prevalence and COVID-19 mortality,2021-09-19,"The recently emerged pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly, leading to a global COVID-19 pandemic. Binding of the viral spike protein (SARS-2-S) to cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates host cell infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wei, Congwen; Wan, Luming; Yan, Qiulin; Wang, Xiaolin; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Yanhong; Sun, Jin; Yang, Xiaopan; Gong, Jing; Fan, Chen; Yang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yufei; Wang, Xuejun; Li, Jianmin; Yang, Huan; Li, Huilong; Zhang, Zhe; Wang, Rong; Du, Peng; Zong, Yulong; Yin, Feng; Zhang, Wanchuan; Peng, Yumeng; Lin, Haotian; Zhang, Rui; Chen, Wei; Gao, Qi; Cao, Yuan; Zhong, Hui",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248872,98

To obtain a position at a PUI, candidates should 1) design a strategy for obtaining a faculty position that suits each individual’s career goals and aspirations, 2) prepare for the application process, on-campus interview, and contract negotiations, and 3) plan a strategy for the probationary period leading up to tenure and promotion. Given the different types of PUIs, candidates need to consider whether they seek a position that consists of all or mostly all teaching, or both teaching and research. Candidates should educate themselves on the expectations at PUI’s, including current thought, practice, and aspirations for science pedagogy, and gain teaching experience prior to seeking a suitable position. If the candidate’s goal is a position with both teaching and research, it is important to discuss with the current research mentor what projects the candidate can take with them to their new position. The candidate should also consider what types of projects will be successful with undergraduate student researchers in a PUI research environment. Importantly, candidates should clearly demonstrate a commitment to diversity and inclusion in their teaching, research, and outreach, and application materials should demonstrate this. On interviews, candidates should be knowledgeable about the mission, values, and resources of the institution and how the candidate will contribute to that mission.

The objective was to examine what communication methods, other than in-person visits, during the pandemic were associated with greater positive and lower negative emotional experiences for LTC residents and their family members and friends. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Nationally-targeted online survey. PARTICIPANTS: 161 community-dwelling adults who had a family member or friend in a LTC facility. MEASUREMENTS: The Positive and Negative Affect Scale was used to assess participant's own emotions and perceived resident emotions during the pandemic. Questions were asked about nine communication methods other than physical visits (e.g., phone, video-conference, e-mail, letters) in terms of frequency of use during the pandemic. Socio-demographics, resident health, and facility factors were assessed and used as covariates where indicated. RESULTS: During the pandemic, greater phone frequency was associated with less participant negative emotions (β=-.17). Greater e-mail frequency was associated with more perceived resident positive emotions (β=.28). Greater frequency of letters delivered by staff was associated with more participant negative emotions (β=.23). Greater frequency of letters delivered by staff and the postal service were associated with more perceived resident negative emotions (β=.28; β=.34, respectively).

664224,Modeling the effectiveness of social distancing interventions on the epidemic curve of coronavirus disease in Ethiopia,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Ever since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, worldwide efforts are being made to “flatten the curve”. Israel was amongst the first countries to impose significant restrictions. As a result, cardiac surgeons have been required to scale down their routine practice, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of cardiac surgeries. The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac surgery in Israel. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study performed in two cardiac surgery departments in Israel and includes all patients who underwent cardiac surgery in March and April during the years 2019 and 2020. The patient cohort was divided into two groups based on the year of operation. Analysis of the patients’ baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcome, was performed. RESULTS: The 2019 group (n = 173), and the 2020 group (n = 108) were similar regarding their baseline characteristics, previous medical history, and rates of previous revascularization interventions. However, compared to the 2019 group, patients in the 2020 group were found to be more symptomatic (NYHA class IV; 2.4% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.007). While all patients underwent similar procedures, patients in the 2020 group had significantly longer procedural time (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rate was found to be significantly higher in group 2020 (13% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: While the number of patients undergoing cardiac surgery declined during the outbreak period, the rate of surgical mortality increased. One explanation for this might be delayed hospital arrival.","Keizman, Eitan; Ram, Eilon; Kachel, Erez; Sternik, Leonid; Raanani, Ehud",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008486/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-020-01342-5,98

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a potassium-binding medication that has been shown to reduce incidence of hyperkalaemia in CKD, non-CKD, and HF populations, which we propose will support maximisation of RAASi therapy. METHODS: We propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants will receive either SZC or placebo. We will up-titrate participants’ RAASi therapy while monitoring their serum potassium levels and adjusting their SZC dose if necessary. Participants with CKD and HF will be recruited from CKD and HF clinics at St George’s Hospital. The total study period will be 18 months; 130 participants will be enrolled for approximately two months each following screening. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who achieve maximum RAASi dose while maintaining normokalaemia. Secondary outcomes include participants reaching maximum RAASi dose without severe hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to severe hyperkalaemia; number of RAASi dose escalations per participant; final doses of RAASi therapy; changes in quality of life score, eGFR, ACR, serum sodium, troponin T; number and duration of hospital admissions; and within-participant change in serum potassium compared to baseline. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first to examine the use of SZC for the maximisation of RAASi dosing in patients with advanced CKD and HF. We will assess the impact of achieving target RAASi dosing on hospital admission rates and duration of stay, with the hope that optimum RAASi treatment will translate into reduced morbidity and improved QoL.

Both patients received aggressive insulin infusion and subcutaneous insulin therapy to obtain adequate glucose management. As their COVID-19 clinical course improved, their severe insulin resistance improved as well.

667345,Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic COVID-19 in China,2020-06-22,"Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) expressed on a variety of DCs, is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes glycans on a diverse range of pathogens, including parasites. The interaction of DC-SIGN with pathogens triggers specific signaling events that modulate DC-maturation and activity and regulate T-cell activation by DCs. In this work we evaluate whether F. hepatica glycans can immune modulate DCs via DC-SIGN. We demonstrate that DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycoconjugates through mannose and fucose residues. We also show that mannose is present in high-mannose structures, hybrid and trimannosyl N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans induce DC-SIGN triggering leading to a strong production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28. In addition, parasite glycans induced regulatory DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation, via the induction of anergic/regulatory T cells, highlighting the role of DC-SIGN in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by F. hepatica. Our data confirm the immunomodulatory properties of DC-SIGN triggered by pathogen-derived glycans and contribute to the identification of immunomodulatory glyans of helminths that might eventually be useful for the design of vaccines against fasciolosis.","Rodríguez, Ernesto; Kalay, Hakan; Noya, Verónica; Brossard, Natalie; Giacomini, Cecilia; van Kooyk, Yvette; García-Vallejo, Juan J.; Freire, Teresa",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28436457/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46748,98

I focus on various interpretations of NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999; the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the sinking of a Chinese ferry in 1999; and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic to explore how Chinese citizens negotiated between their own ambivalent loyalties and the contradictory official, unofficial, local, national, and international narratives in which these events were embedded. These negotiations suggest that global information flows are creating a transnational panopticon that increasingly enables neoliberal governmentality to operate on transnational levels.","FONG, VANESSA L.",Am Ethnol,https://doi.org/10.1525/ae.2007.34.3.521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313328/,98
667785,Progressive Heart Failure and Death as the Initial Manifestation of NK/T-Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report and Literature Review,2021-06-24,"ABSTRACT: Worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is still threatening global health since its outbreak first reported in the late 2019. The causative novel virus has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although COVID-19 emergent with significant mortality, there is no availability of definite treatment measures. It is now extremely desirable to identify potential chemical entities against SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, a state-of-art virtual screening protocol was implemented on three anti-viral specific chemical libraries against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Particularly, viewing the large-scale biological role of M(pro) in the viral replication process it has been considered as a prospective anti-viral drug target. Herein, on collected 79,892 compounds, hierarchical multistep docking followed by relative binding free energy estimation has been performed. Thereafter, implying a user-defined XP-dock and MM-GBSA cut-off scores as −8.00 and −45.00 kcal/mol, chemical space has been further reduced. Exhaustive molecular binding interactions analyses and various pharmacokinetics profiles assessment suggested four compounds (ChemDiv_D658-0159, ChemDiv_F431-0433, Enamine_Z3019991843 and Asinex_LAS_51389260) as potent inhibitors/modulators of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). In-depth protein–ligand interactions stability in the dynamic state has been evaluated by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies along with MM-GBSA-based binding free energy estimations of entire simulation trajectories that have revealed strong binding affinity of all identified compounds towards M(pro). Hence, all four identified compounds might be considered as promising candidates for future drug development specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro); however, they also need experimental assessment for a better understanding of molecular interaction mechanisms.

Case Report,2020-09-01,"The field of precision medicine explores disease treatments by looking at genetic, socio-environmental, and clinical factors, thus trying to provide a holistic view of a person's health. Public health, on the other hand, is focused on improving the health of populations through preventive strategies and timely interventions. With recent advances in technology, we are able to collect, analyze and store for the first-time large volumes of real-time, diverse and continuous health data. Typically, the field of precision medicine deals with a huge amount of data from few individuals; public health, on the other hand, deals with limited data from a population. With the coming of Big Data, the fields of precision medicine and public health are converging into precision public health, the study of biological and genetic factors supported by large amounts of population data. In this paper, we explore through a comprehensive review the data types and use cases found in precision medicine and public health.

670212,Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19,2020-04-27,"One of the main challenges in times of sanitary emergency is to quickly develop computer aided diagnosis systems with a limited number of available samples due to the novelty, complexity of the case and the urgency of its implementation. This is the case during the current pandemic of COVID-19. This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This results in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are recommended during the pandemic, preventing the spread of the disease. However, these devices entail different complications (such as capture quality) that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult and suggest the necessity for computer-aided diagnosis methodologies despite the scarcity of samples available to do so. To solve this problem, we propose a methodology that allows to adapt the knowledge from a well-known domain with a high number of samples to a new domain with a significantly reduced number and greater complexity. We took advantage of a pre-trained segmentation model from brain magnetic resonance imaging of a unrelated pathology and performed two stages of knowledge transfer to obtain a robust system able to segment lung regions from portable X-ray devices despite the scarcity of samples and lesser quality. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy of 0.9761 ± 0.0100 for patients with COVID-19, 0.9801 ± 0.0104 for normal patients and 0.9769 ± 0.0111 for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.","Vidal, Plácido L.; Moura, Joaquim; Novo, Jorge; Ortega, Marcos",Expert Syst Appl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421001184?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417421001184; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612998/,98

However, at this point, it is difficult to determine whether telemedicine fulfills its role as a health care strategy. Arguably, if we had enough previous experience with telemedicine or sufficient preparation for its application, telemedicine could be more smoothly and flexibly adopted in the medical field. As it is still not possible to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, phone consultation and prescription are likely to continue for some time. Hence, it is expected that telemedicine will naturally settle in the medical field in the near future. However, as we have noticed during this outbreak, improvised telemedicine without adequate guidance can be confusing to both patients and health professionals, thus reducing the benefit to patients. Medical staff requires preparation on how to appropriately use telemedicine.

The transmission of the virus is mediated by human contact. To control and prevent the spread of this virus, the majority of people worldwide are facing quarantine; patients are being subjected to non-specific treatments under isolation. To prevent and stop the COVID-19 pandemic, several clinical trials are in the pipeline. The current clinical trials either target the intracellular replication and spread of the virus or the cytokine storm inflammation seen in COVID-19 cases during the later stages of the disease.

COVID-19 was an unexpected pandemic that forced many European countries to take confinement measures and restrict social face to face interactions. This study is an effort to understand how Portuguese residents dealt with the pandemic during the first confinement period, considering different sociodemographic characteristics and trauma exposure perceptions. Five hundred and five adults, between 18 and 79 years old participated in this study via an online self-report assessment protocol. Sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age, marital status, employment status, and caring responsibilities had an impact on individuals’ perceptions regarding their exposure to the pandemic and their quality of life. Perceived exposure to the pandemic was found to predict quality of life in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains.

674071,Association of SARS susceptibility with single nucleic acid polymorphisms of OAS1 and MxA genes: a case-control study,2006-07-06,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020 after the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Across the continents and specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel-related. Understanding how the virus’s transportation across continents and different climatic conditions affect the genetic composition and the consequent effects on transmissibility, infectivity, and virulence of the virus is critical. Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with sequences from selected COVID-19 hotspots/countries in Asia, Europe, North and South America and Oceania. To identify possible distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to those from these selected countries, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase (NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible vaccine coverage targets or potential therapeutic agents. Identity plots for the alignments were created with BioEdit software and the phylogenetic analyses with the MEGA X software. Our results showed mutations in the spike and replicate proteins of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Phylogenetic tree analyses demonstrated variability across the various regions/countries in Africa as there were different clades in the viral proteins. However, a substantial proportion of these mutations (90%) were similar to those described in all the other settings, including the Wuhan strain. There were, however, novel mutations in the genomes of the circulating strains of the virus in African. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting these findings from Africa. However, these findings’ implications on symptomatic or asymptomatic manifestations, progression to severe disease and case fatality for those affected, and the cross efficacy of vaccines developed from other settings when applied in Africa are unknown.","Longjohn, Modeline N.; Egbule, Olivia S.; Danso, Samuel O.; Akujuru, Eugene E.; Ibubeleye, Victor T.; Oweredaba, Christabel I.; Ogharanduku, Theodora; Manu, Alexander; Iweriebor, Benson C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.287201,98

675376,Social media and the new world of scientific communication during the COVID19 pandemic,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Scalp hair loss (alopecia) in women is a common ageing and senescing condition. It usually presents as androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or telogen effluvium (TE) and often has pronounced psychological consequences. ALRV5XR is a novel treatment aiming to regenerate a normal hair phenotype by targeting multiple molecular pathways linked to hair growth promotion and hair follicle stem cell activation. The primary objectives of this 24-week trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in terminal hair (TH) regrowth in women with AGA or TE. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in a USA community clinic. Healthy women 18-65 years of age with AGA or TE of Ludwig classification I-II and Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI were enrolled. They were allocated in a 1:1 ratio into ALRV5XR or placebo treatment groups using a random number table. Masked dermatologist assessments, phototrichograms and blood samples were obtained at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Subjects were given a masked treatment regimen of oral capsules, shampoo, conditioner and follicle serum for daily administration. Main outcomes were absolute and per cent changes in TH density and response rates. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04450602) and is completed. FINDINGS: 46 subjects (23 ALRV5XR, 23 placebo) were enrolled between April 3 and October 20, 2018. Five subjects dropped out and two were non-compliant. Thirty-nine subjects completed the trial (18 ALRV5XR, 21 placebo). At 24 weeks, the absolute change in TH density improved by 30·1THs/cm(2) (95% CI: 15·1–45·1; p=0·0002), and the relative density increased by 19·7% (95% CI: 8·0%–31·4%; p=0·0016). The odds ratio for being a responder (≥0 change) was 2·7. Efficacy increased 133% from week 12 to 24. Efficacy outcomes were similar in AGA and TE subjects. 66·7% of the ALRV5XR group responded by regrowing 40THs/cm(2) or more hair. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: In women with AGA or TE, ALRV5XR treatment significantly increased hair regrowth without adverse events. ALRV5XR displayed a multi-fold improved efficacy and response rate when compared to published trials of standard therapy. Progressive acceleration of TH regrowth suggests regeneration of the structure and function of non-productive telogen follicles and prolonged treatment may restore a normal hair phenotype.","Feldman, Peter R; Fiebig, Klaus M; Piwko, Charles; Mints, Boris M; Brown, Dennis; Cahan, Deborah J; Guevara-Aguirre, Jaime",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235415/,98

As people congregate at MGEs, there is an increased risk of transmission of communicable diseases. Novel respiratory viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Influenza A Virus Subtype H1N1 Strain 2009 (H1N1pdm09), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), may require specific infection prevention and control strategies to minimize the risk of transmission when planning MGEs. This literature review aimed to identify and analyze papers relating to novel respiratory viruses with pandemic potential and to inform MGE planning. METHOD This paper used a systematic literature review method. Various health care databases were searched using keywords relating to MGEs and novel respiratory viruses. Information was extracted from identified papers into various tables for analysis. The analysis identified infection prevention and control strategies used at MGEs to inform planning before, during, and following events. RESULTS In total, 27 papers met the criteria for inclusion. No papers were identified regarding SARS-CoV-1, while the remainder reported on H1N1pdm09 (n = 9), MERS-CoV (n = 15), and SARS-CoV-2 (n = 3). Various before, during, and after event mitigation strategies were identified that can be implemented for future events. CONCLUSIONS This literature review provided an overview of the novel respiratory virus epidemiology at MGEs alongside related public health mitigation strategies that have been implemented at these events. This paper also discusses the health security of event participants and host communities in the context of cancelling, postponing, and modifying events due to a novel respiratory virus.

We aimed to evaluate the psychological distress associated with work-related experiences among medical professionals and supporting staff during the pandemic outbreak. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and May 2020, employing a self-administered on-line questionnaire that included the collection of socio-demographic and professional status information, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a subscale of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) for empathy. A total of 364 professionals of the county-coordinated area responded. Descriptive statistics summarized the findings and a mediation model was analyzed, applying the causal step strategy. The specific direct and causal mediation effects were estimated with the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap sampling method. RESULTS: Anxiety, burnout, stress, resilience, and empathy proved to be significantly associated with both the professional category (ie, consultant, specialty doctor, trainee doctor, senior nurse, trainee nurse or other) and the perceived professional support (the nonparametric multivariate permutation test resulted in p=0.048 and p<0.001, respectively). When controlling for the marital and professional status, the female gender had an OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.21; 4.22) toward a high level of empathy compared to males. The causal mediation effect of the perceived lack of professional support on empathy through burnout-depersonalization was highly significant (p<0.001) with an average of 0.0599, 95% CI (0.0238; 0.10), while the direct effect was non-significant (p=0.536) with an average of 0.0295, 95% CI (−0.0774; 0.15). CONCLUSION: We highlighted the impact of the lack of professional support on healthcare workers’ empathy through burnout-depersonalization in a context of a high workload, time pressure, job stress beyond previous training, and inherently limited organizational support, which are potentially modifiable factors in the mid-term.","Bredicean, Cristina; Tamasan, Simona Claudia; Lungeanu, Diana; Giurgi-Oncu, Catalina; Stoica, Ileana-Pepita; Panfil, Anca-Livia; Vasilian, Claudia; Secosan, Ica; Ursoniu, Sorin; Patrascu, Raul",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104014/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s300578,98

681659,Pneumonia due to Mycobacterium cosmeticum in a renal transplant recipient,2021-03-02,"Despite significant improvement in computational and observational capabilities, predicting intensity and intensification of major tropical cyclones remains a challenge. In 2017 Hurricane Maria intensified to a Category 5 storm within 24 h, devastating Puerto Rico. In 2019 Hurricane Dorian, predicted to remain tropical storm, unexpectedly intensified into a Category 5 storm and destroyed the Bahamas. The official forecast and computer models were unable to predict rapid intensification of these storms. One possible reason for this is that key physics, including microscale processes at the air-sea interface, are poorly understood and parameterized in existing forecast models. Here we show that surfactants significantly affect the generation of sea spray, which provides some of the fuel for tropical cyclones and their intensification, but also provides some of the drag that limits intensity and intensification. Using a numerical model verified with a laboratory experiment, which predicts spray radii distribution starting from a 100 μm radius, we show that surfactants increase spray generation by 20–34%. We anticipate that bio-surfactants affect heat, energy, and momentum exchange through altered size distribution and concentration of sea spray, with consequences for tropical cyclone intensification or decline, particularly in areas of algal blooms and near coral reefs, as well as in areas affected by oil spills and dispersants.","Vanderplow, Breanna; Soloviev, Alexander V.; Dean, Cayla W.; Haus, Brian K.; Lukas, Roger; Sami, Muhammad; Ginis, Isaac",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76226-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33149134/,98

We surveyed the databases related to pharmacies, eHealth, e-Prescriptions, and related digital health websites for each country, and their system architectures. We also compared the digital security and privacy protocols in place within and across these digital systems. We evaluated the systems' authentication protocols used by pharmacies to verify patients' identities during the medication dispensing process. Furthermore, we examined the supporting systems/services used to manage patients' medication histories and enhance patients' medication safety.

While the present study was conducted before the onset of COVID-19, e-Prescription systems have become highly relevant during the current pandemic and hence, a deeper understanding of the country systems' architecture and digital security that can help design effective strategies against the pandemic. e-Prescription systems can help reduce physical contact and the risk of exposure to the virus, as well as the wait times in pharmacies, thus enhancing patient safety and improving planetary health.","Aldughayfiq, Bader; Sampalli, Srinivas",OMICS,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931378/,98
684979,Risking further COVID-19 waves despite vaccination,2021-03-18,"Although coronavirus tropism is most often ascribed to receptor availability, mounting evidence suggests that, for the neurotropic strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), spike-receptor interactions cannot fully explain neurovirulence. The canonical MHV receptor CEACAM1a and its spike-binding site have been extensively characterized. However, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in neurons, and the extremely neurotropic MHV strain JHM.SD infects ceacam1a−/− mice and spreads among ceacam1a−/− neurons. Two proposed alternative MHV receptors, CEACAM2 and PSG16, also fail to account for neuronal spread of JHM.SD in the absence of CEACAM1a. JHM.SD has been reported to have an unusually labile spike protein, enabling it to perform receptor-independent spread (RIS), but it is not clear that the ability to perform RIS is fully responsible for the extremely neurovirulent phenotype. We propose that the extreme neurovirulence of JHM.SD is multifactorial and might include as-yet unidentified neuron-specific mechanisms of spread.","Phillips, Judith M.; Weiss, Susan R.",Trends in Pharmacological Sciences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614710002014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2010.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165614710002014; http://www.cell.com/article/S0165614710002014/pdf,98
685616,A Silent Infection Pandemic of COVID-19: Epidemiological Investigation and Hypothetical Models,2020-07-05,"Airborne black carbon is a strong warming component of the atmosphere. Therefore, curbing black carbon emissions should slow down global warming. The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is a unique opportunity for studying the response of black carbon to the varied human activities, in particular due to lockdown policies. Actually, there is few knowledge on the variations of black carbon in China during lockdowns. Here, we studied the concentrations of particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and black carbon before, during, and after the lockdown in nine sites of the Yangtze River Delta in Eastern China. Results show 40–60% reduction of PM(2.5) and 40–50% reduction of black carbon during the lockdown. The classical bimodal peaks of black carbon in the morning and evening rush hours were highly weakened, indicating the substantial decrease of traffic activities. Contributions from fossil fuels combustion to black carbon decreased about 5–10% during the lockdown. Spatial correlation analysis indicated the clustering of the multi-site black carbon concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta during the lockdown. Overall, control of emissions from traffic and industrial activities should be efficient to curb black carbon levels in the frame of a ‘green public transit system’ for mega-city clusters such as the Yangtze River Delta.

METHODS: The neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and platelet count of 404,272 Chinese healthy adults (>18 years old) were measured by Sysmex XE‐2100 automatic hematology analyzer, and NLR, LMR, and PLR were calculated. According to CLSI C28‐A3, the nonparametric 95% percentile interval is defined as the reference interval. RESULTS: The results of Mann‐Whitney U test showed that NLR (p < .001) in male was significantly higher than that in female; LMR (p < .001) and PLR (p < .001) in male were significantly lower than that in female. Kruskal‐Wallis H test showed that there were significant differences in NLR, LMR, and PLR among different genders and age groups (p < .001). The linear graph showed that the reference upper limit of NLR and PLR increased with age and the reference upper limit of LMR decreases with age in male population. In female population, the reference upper limit of NLR in 50–59 group, LMR in >80 group, and PLR in 70–79 group appeared a trough; the reference upper limit of NLR in >80 group, LMR in 50–59 group, and PLR in 40–49 group appeared peak. CONCLUSION: The establishment of RI for NLR, LMR, and PLR in Chinese healthy adults according to gender and age will promote the standardization of clinical application.","Wang, Junjun; Zhang, Fan; Jiang, Feng; Hu, Lijuan; Chen, Jian; Wang, Yumin",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34390017/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23935,98
687463,Impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the severity of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients,2020-10-27,"RATIONALE: To address unmet needs, electronic messages to support person-centered goal attainment and secondary prevention may avoid hospital presentations/readmissions after stroke, but evidence is limited. HYPOTHESIS: Compared to control participants, there will be a 10% lower proportion of intervention participants who represent to hospital (emergency/admission) within 90 days of randomization. METHODS AND DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. The intervention group receives 12 weeks of personalized, goal-centered, and administrative electronic messages, while the control group only receive administrative messages. The trial includes a process evaluation, assessment of treatment fidelity, and an economic evaluation. Participants: Confirmed stroke (modified Rankin Score: 0-4), aged &#8805;18 years with internet/mobile phone access, discharged directly home from hospital. Randomization: 1:1 computer-generated, stratified by age and baseline disability. Outcomes assessments: Collected at 90 days and 12 months following randomization. OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes include hospital emergency presentations/admissions within 90 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal attainment, self-efficacy, mood, unmet needs, disability, quality-of-life, recurrent stroke/cardiovascular events/deaths at 90 days and 12 months, and death and cost-effectiveness at 12 months. Sample size: To test our primary hypothesis, we estimated a sample size of 890 participants (445 per group) with 80% power and two-tailed significance threshold of &#945; = 0.05. Given uncertainty for the effect size of this novel intervention, the sample size will be adaptively re-estimated when outcomes for n = 668 are obtained, with maximum sample capped at 1100. DISCUSSION: We will provide new evidence on the potential effectiveness, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of a tailored eHealth intervention for survivors of stroke.","Cadilhac, Dominique A; Cameron, Jan; Kilkenny, Monique F; Andrew, Nadine E; Harris, Dawn; Ellery, Fiona; Thrift, Amanda G; Purvis, Tara; Kneebone, Ian; Dewey, Helen; Drummond, Avril; Hackett, Maree; Grimley, Rohan; Middleton, Sandy; Thijs, Vincent; Cloud, Geoffrey; Carey, Mariko; Butler, Ernest; Ma, Henry; Churilov, Leonid; Hankey, Graeme J; English, Coralie; Lannin, Natasha A",Int J Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037468/; https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930211022678,98

689952,A cluster-control approach to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on a stroke ward with infection control considerations for dementia and vascular units,2021-01-11,"OBJECTIVES: Analysis of nosocomial transmission in the early stages of the pandemic at a large multi-site healthcare institution. Nosocomial incidence is linked with infection control interventions.. METHODS: Viral genome sequence and epidemiological data were analysed for 574 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients including 86 nosocomial cases during the first 19 days of the pandemic. RESULTS: 44 putative transmission clusters were found through epidemiological analysis, which included 234 cases and all 86 nosocomial cases. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was obtained from 168/234 (72%) of these cases in epidemiological clusters, including 77/86 (90%) nosocomial cases. Only 75/168 (45%) linked, sequenced cases were not refuted by applying genomic data, creating 14 final clusters accounting for 59/77 (77%) sequenced nosocomial cases. Viral haplotypes from these clusters were enriched 1-14x (median 4x) compared to the community. Three factors implicated unidentified cases in transmission: i) community-onset or indeterminate cases were absent in 7/14 (50%) of clusters ii) 4 (29%) clusters had additional evidence of cryptic transmission. iii) In 3 (21%) clusters, diagnosis of the earliest case was delayed which may have facilitated transmission. Nosocomial cases decreased to low levels (0-2 per day) despite continuing high numbers of admissions of community-onset SARS-CoV-2 cases (40-50 per day) and before the impact of introducing universal face-masks or banning hospital visitors. CONCLUSION: Genomics was necessary to accurately resolve transmission clusters Our data supports unidentified cases, such as healthcare workers or asymptomatic patients, as important vectors of transmission. Evidence is needed to ascertain whether routine screening increases case ascertainment and limits nosocomial transmission.","Snell, Luke B.; Fisher, Chloe L.; Taj, Usman; Stirrup, Oliver; Merrick, Blair; Alcolea-Medina, Adela; Charalampous, Themoula; Signell, Adrian W.; Wilson, Harry D.; Betancor, Gilberto; Kia Ik, Mark Tan; Cunningham, Emma; Cliff, Penelope R.; Pickering, Suzanne; Galao, Rui Pedro; Batra, Rahul; Neil, Stuart J.D.; Malim, Michael H.; Doores, Katie J.; Douthwaite, Sam T.; Nebbia, Gaia",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.07.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21004353?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400345/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21004353,98
690445,Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in Australia,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Information regarding the incidence and characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia amongst pregnant women is scarce. METHODS: Single-centre experience with 32 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 5 to April 5, 2020 at Madrid, Spain. FINDINGS: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 61·5% (32/52) women. Only 18·7% (6/32) had some underlying condition (mostly asthma). Supplemental oxygen therapy was required in 18 patients (56·3%), with high-flow requirements in six (18·7%). Eight patients (25·0%) fulfilled the criteria for acute distress respiratory syndrome. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in two patients (6·2%). Tocilizumab was administered in five patients (15·6%). Delivery was precipitated due to COVID-19 in three women (9·4%). All the newborns had a favourable outcome, with no cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe cases of pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen were more likely to exhibit bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray (55·6% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·003) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels >10 mg/dL (33·0% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·05) at admission than those with no oxygen requirements. INTERPRETATION: Pregnant women with COVID-19 have a high risk of developing pneumonia, with a severe course in more than half of cases. The presence of bilateral kung infiltrates and elevated serum CRP at admission may identify women at-risk of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
