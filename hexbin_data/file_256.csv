997,997,997,The changing phenotype of microglia from homeostasis to disease,14.810665,7.152593,2012-04-24,"It has been nearly a century since the early description of microglia by Rio-Hortega; since then many more biological and pathological features of microglia have been recognized. Today, microglia are generally considered to be beneficial to homeostasis at the resting state through their abilities to survey the environment and phagocytose debris. However, when activated microglia assume diverse phenotypes ranging from fully inflamed, which involves the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, to alternatively activated, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines or neurotrophins, the consequences to neurons can range from detrimental to supportive. Due to the different experimental sets and conditions, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the controversial question of whether microglia are “good” or “bad.” While it is well understood that the dual roles of activated microglia depend on specific situations, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unclear, and the interpretation of certain findings related to diverse microglial phenotypes continues to be problematic. In this review we discuss the functions of microglia in neuronal survival and neurogenesis, the crosstalk between microglia and surrounding cells, and the potential factors that could influence the eventual manifestation of microglia.","Luo, Xiao-Guang; Chen, Sheng-Di",Transl Neurodegener,256,17
1060,1060,1060,Quantitative analysis of ciliary beating in primary ciliary dyskinesia: a pilot study,15.290948,6.9115596,2012-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital respiratory disorder characterized by abnormal ciliary motility leading to chronic airway infections. Qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern based on digital high-speed videomicroscopy analysis has been proposed in the diagnosis process of PCD. Although this evaluation is easy in typical cases, it becomes difficult when ciliary beating is partially maintained. We postulated that a quantitative analysis of beat pattern would improve PCD diagnosis. We compared quantitative parameters with the qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern in patients in whom the diagnosis of PCD was confirmed or excluded. METHODS: Nasal nitric oxide measurement, nasal brushings and biopsies were performed prospectively in 34 patients with suspected PCD. In combination with qualitative analysis, 12 quantitative parameters of ciliary beat pattern were determined on high-speed videomicroscopy recordings of beating ciliated edges. The combination of ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities on transmission electron microscopy analysis with low nasal nitric oxide levels was the “gold standard” used to establish the diagnosis of PCD. RESULTS: This “gold standard” excluded PCD in 15 patients (non-PCD patients), confirmed PCD in 10 patients (PCD patients) and was inconclusive in 9 patients. Among the 12 parameters, the distance traveled by the cilium tip weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges presented 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis were concordant in non-PCD patients. In 9/10 PCD patients, quantitative analysis was concordant with the “gold standard”, while the qualitative evaluation was discordant with the “gold standard” in 3/10 cases. Among the patients with an inconclusive “gold standard”, the use of quantitative parameters supported PCD diagnosis in 4/9 patients (confirmed by the identification of disease-causing mutations in one patient) and PCD exclusion in 2/9 patients. CONCLUSIONS: When the beat pattern is normal or virtually immotile, the qualitative evaluation is adequate to study ciliary beating in patients suspected for PCD. However, when cilia are still beating but with moderate alterations (more than 40% of patients suspected for PCD), quantitative analysis is required to precise the diagnosis and can be proposed to select patients eligible for TEM.","Papon, Jean-François; Bassinet, Laurence; Cariou-Patron, Gwenaëlle; Zerah-Lancner, Francoise; Vojtek, Anne-Marie; Blanchon, Sylvain; Crestani, Bruno; Amselem, Serge; Coste, Andre; Housset, Bruno; Escudier, Estelle; Louis, Bruno",Orphanet J Rare Dis,256,1

The rapid accumulation and wide availability of omic data generated by these technologies offer great opportunities to unravel disease mechanisms, but also presents significant challenges to extract knowledge from such massive data and to evaluate the findings. To address these challenges, a number of pathway and network based approaches have been introduced.

2040,2040,2040,Sex-specific regulation of chemokine Cxcl5/6 controls neutrophil recruitment and tissue injury in acute inflammatory states,15.106806,6.9578547,2015-11-26,"BACKGROUND: Tissue infiltration by neutrophils during acute inflammatory states causes substantial tissue injury. While the magnitude of tissue neutrophil accumulation in innate immune responses is profoundly greater in males than females, fundamental aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated sex differences in neutrophil stimulation and recruitment in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; mesenteric or renal) or carrageenan pleurisy in rats or mice, as well as skin injury in human volunteers. The induction of potent chemoattractive mediators (chemokines) and neutrophil adhesion molecules were measured by real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and protein assays. RESULTS: Mesenteric I/R in age-matched Wistar rats resulted in substantially more neutrophil accumulation and tissue injury at 2 h reperfusion in males than females. Using intravital microscopy, we show that the immediate (<30 min) neutrophil response to I/R is similar in males and females but that prolonged neutrophil recruitment occurs in males at sites local and distal to inflammatory insult partly due to an increase in circulating neutrophil populations with elevated surface expression of adhesion molecules. Sex differences in neutrophil kinetics were correlated with sustained induction of chemokine Cxcl5 in the tissue, circulation, and bone marrow of males but not females. Furthermore, blockade of Cxcl5 in males prior to ischemia resulted in neutrophil responses that were similar in magnitude to those in females. Conversely, administration of Cxcl5 to males in the absence of I/R was sufficient to increase levels of systemic neutrophils. Cxcl5 treatment of bone marrow neutrophils in vitro caused substantial induction of neutrophil-mobilizing cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and expression of β2 integrin that accounts for sexual dimorphism in circulating neutrophil populations in I/R. Moreover, male Cxcl5-stimulated bone marrow neutrophils had an increased capacity to adhere to β2 integrin ligand ICAM-1, implicating a greater sensitivity of male leukocytes to Cxcl5-mediated activation. Differential induction of Cxcl5 (human CXCL6) between the sexes was also evident in murine renal I/R, rat pleurisy, and human skin blisters and correlated with the magnitude of neutrophil accumulation in tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that sex-specific induction of chemokine Cxcl5/CXCL6 contributes to sexual dimorphism in neutrophil recruitment in diverse acute inflammatory responses partly due to increased stimulation and trafficking of bone marrow neutrophils in males.

2134,2134,2134,Imported Plasmodium vivax malaria with severe thrombocytopaenia: can it be severe malaria or not?,14.952663,7.195418,2016-02-19,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopaenia is the most frequent malaria-associated haematologic alteration observed with all five Plasmodium parasites causing disease in humans. Although not included in the World Health Organization criteria for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, severe thrombocytopaenia has been increasingly mentioned as an indicator of P. vivax malaria severity. CASE: Here, it is described a case of imported P. vivax malaria in a 37-year old man from Pakistan who presented with severe thrombocytopaenia (5 × 10(9)/L). He was admitted to the intensive care unit and initially treated with a 1-day course of intravenous quinine followed by oral chloroquine and primaquine. The patient’s platelet count increased as early as 4 hours after treatment inception and the clinical course was favourable and uneventful. DISCUSSION: This case report, along with a review of published cases focusing on the relationship between thrombocytopaenia and severe P. vivax malaria, suggests that the prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia is ambiguous in absence of severe haemorraghic complications and its use as diagnostic criterion of malaria severity may lead to overestimation of severe P. vivax malaria cases. CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of high quality studies it is at present unclear if severe thrombocytopaenia in the setting of P. vivax malaria should be considered indicative of severe malaria.","Antinori, Spinello; Corona, Alberto; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa; Galimberti, Laura; Ricaboni, Davide; Milazzo, Laura; Corbellino, Mario",Malar J,256,1
3671,3671,3671,Effectiveness of Integrative Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease Management,15.032557,7.0739746,2019-02-26,"Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of integrative therapy on prevalence and length of hospitalization and management of major complications of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the South Korea. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in the South Korea. Patients over 65 years old who were newly diagnosed with PD during 2007–2011 were identified. The integrative therapy group was defined as patients treated with both Korean medicine (KM) and biomedicine, and the monotherapy group consisted of patients treated with biomedicine alone. From PD diagnosis to 2013, the prevalence and annual length of hospitalization because of PD and major complications (dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis) were analyzed using logistic regression, ANOVA and t-tests after propensity score (PS) matching with a 1:1 ratio. Results: After PS estimation and matching, the cohort used in the analysis included 228 subjects (114 integrative therapy group, 114 monotherapy group). Sex, age, index year, comorbidity, severity of disability, neurologic care, and anti-parkinsonism medication (levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, selegiline) were adjusted in both groups. The prevalence of hospitalization due to pneumonia/sepsis was 0.50 times (95% C.I.: 0.26–0.96) lower in the integrative therapy group than the monotherapy group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.038). The prevalence and annual length of total hospitalization and hospitalization because of PD, dementia, and depression in the integrative therapy group showed positive results compared to the monotherapy group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: It has not been clearly identified that integrative therapy with KM and biomedicine for PD management is better treatment for patients compared to biomedicine monotherapy; however, we found a clue of better result in integrated therapy. Therefore, further investigation by increasing the number of subjects is needed to confirm the findings presented herein.","Woo, Yeonju; Hyun, Min Kyung",Front Aging Neurosci,256,17

This unanticipated reemergence is ironic, given that polioviruses, once the major causes of AFM, are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead, the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68, until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic, virologic, and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral disease emergence.","Morens, David M.; Folkers, Gregory K.; Fauci, Anthony S.",mBio,256,1

4399,4399,4399,Droplet-Transmitted Infection Risk Ranking Based on Close Proximity Interaction,15.084661,7.2834835,2020-01-21,"We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases. This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.","Guo, Shihui; Yu, Jubo; Shi, Xinyu; Wang, Hongran; Xie, Feibin; Gao, Xing; Jiang, Min",Front Neurorobot,256,1

METHODS: In 60 ARDS patients, we measured EVLW (PiCCO2 device) at a PEEP level set to reach a plateau pressure of 30 cmH(2)O (HighPEEP(start)) and 15 and 45 min after decreasing PEEP to 5 cmH(2)O (LowPEEP(15′) and LowPEEP(45′), respectively). Then, we increased PEEP back to the baseline level (HighPEEP(end)). Between HighPEEP(start) and LowPEEP(15′), we estimated the degree of lung derecruitment either by measuring changes in the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in the whole population, or by measuring the lung derecruited volume in 30 patients. We defined patients with a large derecruitment from the other ones as patients in whom the Crs changes and the measured derecruited volume were larger than the median of these variables observed in the whole population. RESULTS: Reducing PEEP from HighPEEP(start) (14 ± 2 cmH(2)O) to LowPEEP(15′) significantly decreased EVLW from 20 ± 4 to 18 ± 4 mL/kg, central venous pressure (CVP) from 15 ± 4 to 12 ± 4 mmHg, the arterial oxygen tension over inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio from 184 ± 76 to 150 ± 69 mmHg and lung volume by 144 [68–420] mL. The EVLW decrease was similar in “large derecruiters” and the other patients. When PEEP was re-increased to HighPEEP(end), CVP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) and EVLW significantly re-increased. At linear mixed effect model, EVLW changes were significantly determined only by changes in PEEP and CVP (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively, n = 60). When the same analysis was performed by estimating recruitment according to lung volume changes (n = 30), CVP remained significantly associated to the changes in EVLW (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, changing the PEEP level induced parallel, small and reversible changes in EVLW. These changes were not due to an artefact of the TPTD technique and were likely due to the PEEP-induced changes in CVP, which is the backward pressure of the lung lymphatic drainage.

Plasmodium parasites reside in erythrocytes and can theoretically reach all host tissues via the circulation.

Such tissue specificity of the parasite can alter the outcome of malaria disease, determining whether acute or chronic complications occur.

At this stage, spontaneous survival is poor, less than 25%. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of specific management of patients with HBV-ALI/FH. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute HBVinfection and acute exacerbations of chronic HBVinfection can cause acute liver injury (ALI) or fulminant hepatitis (FH). Spontaneous survival at this stage is poor. It is urgent to distinguish between these two entities so that antiviral therapy can be initiated rapidly. Although the indications for antiviral therapy are clear for HBV reactivation, there is no true consensus regarding ALI/FH related to acute HBV infection. The global management of HBV-related FH does not differ from that implemented for other causes of FH, i.e. close cardiorespiratory and neurological monitoring, treatment with acetylcysteine, organ support in the event of organ failure (haemodynamic, renal, respiratory) and albumin dialysis. Liver transplantation remains the only alternative when certain criteria for a poor prognosis are met. A recurrence of HBV infection on the graft can be prevented post-transplant by the administration of HBIG and antiviral therapy for HBV, the modalities varying depending on the risk of recurrence.","Ichai, Philippe; Samuel, Didier",Curr Infect Dis Rep,256,1

However, the pathophysiological consequences of such infections in asthma are largely unclear. Objective To examine the effect of rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection on airway hypersensitivity to histamine. and on interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) in nasal lavage. Objective Twenty‐seven non‐smoking atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects participated in a placebo‐controlled, parallel study. A dose of 0.5–2.9 ± 10(4) TCID50 RV16 or placebo was nasally administered. Cold symptoms were recorded by questionnaire throughout the study. Histamine challenges were performed at entry, and on days 4 and 11 after inoculation. Nasal lavages were obtained at entry, and on days 2 and 9. The response to histamine was measured by PC(20) (changes expressed as doubling doses: DD). IL‐8 levels were obtained by ELISA, and were expressed in ng/ml. Results RV infection was confirmed by culture of nasal lavage and/or by antibody titre rise in each of the RV16‐treated subjects. Among the 19 RV16‐treated subjects, eight developed severe cold symptoms. Baseline FEV(1) did not change significantly during the study in either treatment group (P= 0.99). However, in the RV16‐treated subjects there was a decrease in PC(20) at day 4, which was most pronounced in those with a severe cold (mean change ± SEM: –1.14 ± 0.28 DD, P= 0.01). In addition. IL‐8 levels increased in tbe RV16 group at days 2 and 9 (P < 0.001). The increase in nasal IL‐8 at day 2 correlated significantly with the change in PC(20) at day 4 (r=–0.48, P= 0.04). Conclusion We conclude that the severity of cold, as induced by experimental RV16 infection, is a determinant of the increase in airway hypersensitivity to histamine in patients with asthma.

This increase was preceded by a complete depletion of the peritoneum of the subpopulation of macrophages that supports a productive infection by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). The depletion of LDV-permissive macrophages was a long-term effect; at 50 days post-infection with MHV, the proportion of LDV-permissive macrophages in the peritoneum had reached only 20% of that observed in the peritoneum of uninfected mice, whereas the total number of macrophages in the peritoneum had returned to normal. Furthermore, MHV infection resulted in a long-term alteration in the proliferative response of spleen T cells to concanavalin A (ConA) and in their ability to produce interferon γ; several times higher concentrations of ConA were required to induce a maximum proliferative response in spleen T cell populations from 5-week MHV-infected B10.A mice than in spleen T cell populations from infected companion mice but the former produced 5 times more interferon γ than the T cells from unifected mice.","Even, Chen; Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Plagemann, Peter G.W.",Virus Res,256,1

The characteristics of abdominal trauma patients with poor outcomes related to obesity require evaluation. We hypothesize that obesity is related to increased mortality and length of stay (LOS) among abdominal trauma patients undergoing laparotomies. METHODS: Abdominal trauma patients were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank between 2013 and 2015. Patients who received laparotomies were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate the mortality rate and LOS between obese and non-obese patients. Patients without laparotomies were analyzed as a control group using PSM cohort analysis. RESULTS: A total of 33,798 abdominal trauma patients were evaluated, 10,987 of them received laparotomies. Of these patients, the proportion of obesity in deceased patients was significantly higher when compared to the survivors (33.1% vs. 26.2%, p < 0.001). Elevation of one kg/m(2) of body mass index independently resulted in 2.5% increased odds of mortality. After a well-balanced PSM, obese patients undergoing laparotomies had significantly higher mortality rates [3.7% vs. 2.4%, standardized difference (SD) = 0.241], longer hospital LOS (11.1 vs. 9.6 days, SD = 0.135), and longer intensive care unit LOS (3.5 vs. 2.3 days, SD = 0.171) than non-obese patients undergoing laparotomies. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with increased mortality in abdominal trauma patients who received laparotomies versus those who did not. Obesity requires a careful evaluation of alternatives to laparotomy in injured patients.

A group of individuals, who can be called responsive individuals, will be safe from the risk of drug abuse, by receiving and understanding such information. In this paper, by proposing mathematical models, we investigate the effect of the distribution of this kind of information on the transformation of susceptible individuals into responsive individuals as well as their effect in preventing the occurrence of substance abuse epidemics. In these models, we take into account the fact that the spirit of responsiveness of these individuals can be decayed with time, and these people can become susceptible people, and eventually to addicts. We analyze the dynamical properties of the models, such as local and global stability of equilibrium points and the occurrence of backward bifurcation. The results of this study show that the higher the rate of conversion of susceptible individuals to those responsive, the prevention of drug epidemy is easier.","Memarbashi, Reza; Sorouri, Elahe",Eur Phys J Plus,256,1

Acute ethanol exposure reduces intrinsic excitability of lateral OFC (lOFC) neurons, while chronic exposure and long-term drinking influence plasticity of intrinsic excitability and function of glutamatergic synapses. However, the time course that these adaptations occur across a history of ethanol drinking is unknown. The current study examined whether short-term and long-term voluntary ethanol consumption using an intermittent access paradigm would alter the biophysical properties of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the ACC and lOFC. Neuronal spiking varied in the ACC with an initial increase in evoked firing after 1 d of drinking followed by a decrease in firing in mice that consumed ethanol for one week. No difference in lOFC spike number was observed between water controls and 1-d ethanol drinking mice, but mice that consumed ethanol for one week or more showed a significant increase in evoked firing. Voluntary ethanol drinking for 4 weeks also produced a total loss of ethanol inhibition of lOFC neurons. There was no effect of drinking on excitatory or inhibitory synaptic events in ACC or lOFC neurons across all time points in this model. Overall, these results demonstrate that voluntary drinking alters neuronal excitability in the ACC and lOFC in distinct ways and on a different time scale that may contribute to the impairment of prefrontal cortex-dependent behaviors observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD).","Cannady, Reginald; Nimitvilai-Roberts, Sudarat; Jennings, Sarah D.; Woodward, John J.; Mulholland, Patrick J.",eNeuro,256,1

Noninactivated vaccines, especially viral vector vaccines such as adenovirus and poxvirus vaccines, dominate the vaccine market because their viral particles are able to replicate and proliferate in vivo and produce lasting immunity in a manner similar to natural infection. One challenge of human and livestock vaccination is vaccine stability related to the antigenicity and infectivity. Freeze-drying is the typical method to maintain virus vaccine stability, while cold chain transportation is required for temperatures about 2 °C–8 °C. The financial and technological resource requirements hinder vaccine distribution in underdeveloped areas. In this study, we developed a freeze-drying formula consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA), l-glutamic acid (L-Glu), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and dextran (DEX) to improve the thermal stability and activity of viral vaccines, including vaccinia recombinant vaccine (rTTV-OVA) and adenovirus vaccine (Ad5-ENV). We compared a panel of five different formulations (PEG: DEX: BSA: L-GLU = 50:9:0:0(#1), 50:5:4:0(#2), 50:10:9:0(#3), 50:0:0:9(#4), and 50:1:0:8(#5), respectively) and optimized the freeze-drying formula for rTTV-OVA and Ad5-ENV. We found that the freeze-drying formulations #2 and #3 could maintain rTTV-OVA infectivity at temperatures of 4 °C and 25 °C and that rTTV-OVA immunogenicity was retained during lyophilization. However, formulations #4 and #5 maintained Ad5-ENV infectivity under the same conditions, and Ad5-ENV immunogenicity had maximum retention with freeze-drying formulation #4. In summary, we developed new freeze-drying formulations that increased virus vaccine storage times and retained immunogenicity at an ambient temperature.","Chen, Ye; Liao, Qibin; Chen, Tianyue; Zhang, Yuchao; Yuan, Weien; Xu, Jianqing; Zhang, Xiaoyan",Virol Sin,256,22

New findings, starting from our proteomics studies on IPF, suggest that systemic involvement with altered molecular mechanisms and metabolic disorder is an underlying cause of fibrosis. The role of metabolic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of IPF has not been extensively studied, despite a recent surge of interest. In particular, our studies on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have shown that the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the hypoxia/oxidative stress response, and changes in iron and lipid metabolism are involved in onset of IPF. These processes appear to interact in an intricate manner and to be related to different fibrosing pathologies not directly linked to the lung environment. The disordered metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and hormones has been documented in lung, liver, and kidney fibrosis. Correcting these metabolic alterations may offer a new strategy for treating fibrosis. This paper focuses on the role of metabolic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of IPF and is a continuation of our previous studies, investigating metabolic dysregulation as a new target for fibrosis therapy.","Bargagli, Elena; Refini, Rosa Metella; d’Alessandro, Miriana; Bergantini, Laura; Cameli, Paolo; Vantaggiato, Lorenza; Bini, Luca; Landi, Claudia",Int J Mol Sci,256,17

This study sought to identify ophthalmic medicines granted United Kingdom MA and consider trends in licence approvals. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed published lists of products granted MA by the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency between January 2001 and December 2018, inclusive. Eye drops and medicinal products intended for ophthalmic use were identified. All regulatory data sources consulted are in the public domain. Data analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: A total of 295 MAs were issued for ophthalmic products between 2001 and 2018, inclusive. Of these 229 (78%) were for single-active substances and 66 (22%) fixed-dose combination (FDC). Approvals for products with single-active substance included ocular hypotensives (115; 50%), antibiotics (48; 22%), allergy medicines (30; 13%), lubricants (18; 8%) and anti-inflammatories (11; 5%). Approvals for FDCs were predominantly ocular hypotensives (56; 85%), with timolol combined with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (27; 48%) and prostaglandin analogues (26; 46%) accounting for the majority of glaucoma FDCs. Other FDCs were approved for antibiotic/inflammatory (5; 7.5%), pupillary mydriasis (2; 3%), allergy (2; 3%) and ocular surface lubrication (1; 1.5%) products. A median of 16 licences were approved per year (range 7 [2005] to 35 [2011]). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of MAs granted were for single-agent products, particularly ocular hypotensives and antibiotic preparations. Most products were generic versions of well-established active substances. A trend for increased approvals for FDCs is evident, particularly for the treatment of raised IOP.","Morgan-Warren, Peter J.; Morarji, Jiten B.",Eye (Lond),256,8

Limited research in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have assessed healthcare worker stances towards genomics. This study aimed to assess healthcare workers’ knowledge and attitudes on genetic testing. A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers practicing in either public or private hospitals or clinics as pharmacists, nurses, physicians, managers, and allied health. Participants were recruited randomly and via snowball techniques. Surveys were collected between April and September 2019; out of 552 respondents, 63.4% were female, the mean age was 38 (±9.6) years old. The mean knowledge score was 5.2 (±2.3) out of nine, which shows a fair level of knowledge. The scores of respondents of pharmacy were 5.1 (±2.5), medicine 6.0 (±2.0), and nursing 4.8 (±2.1). All participants exhibited a fair knowledge level about genetic testing and pharmacogenomics. Of the respondents, 91.9% showed a positive attitude regarding availability of genetic testing. The top identified barrier to implementation was the cost of testing (62%), followed by lack of training or education and insurance coverage (57.8% and 57.2%, respectively). Building upon the positive attitudes and tackling the barriers and challenges will pave the road for full implementation of genetic testing and pharmacogenomics in the UAE. We recommend empowering healthcare workers by improving needed and tailored competencies related to their area of practice. We strongly urge the stakeholders to streamline and benchmark the workflow, algorithm, and guidelines to standardize the health and electronic system. Lastly, we advocate utilizing technology and electronic decision support as well as the translational report to back up healthcare workers in the UAE.","Rahma, Azhar T.; Elsheik, Mahanna; Ali, Bassam R.; Elbarazi, Iffat; Patrinos, George P.; Ahmed, Luai A.; Al Maskari, Fatma",J Pers Med,256,17

Exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), mediates nuclear export of proteins, rRNAs, snRNAs, and some mRNAs. In this study, we have identified an essential role of XPO1 in regulating Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication during primary infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Treatment with an XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of XPO1 reduced KSHV lytic replication but had no effect on KSHV entry and trafficking. XPO1 inhibition induced retention of autophagy adaptor protein p62 (SQSTM1) in the nucleus, which enhanced activation of TBK1 and IRF3. As a result, nuclear accumulation of p62 increased expression of innate immune-related genes including IRF7, ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, leading to a reduction of KSHV lytic replication. These results illustrate a novel mechanism by which XPO1 mediates innate immune response and KSHV replication, and identify XPO1 as a potential therapeutic target and KPT-8602 as a promising therapeutic agent for KSHV infection.","Meng, Wen; Gao, Shou-Jiang",Cell Death Dis,256,1

The goal of this study was to identify and analyze patients lost to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 282 trauma victims from a non-governmental organizational (NGO) hospital in Sierra Leone, Africa. During a 3-month period (10.10.2015–08.01.2016), these patients had 367 injuries and underwent 263 orthopedic surgeries. Despite a clear indication, some patients did not receive surgical treatment. We identified these injuries and the reason why they could not be operated. The anatomic region of the injury was evaluated and if they had a bone or soft tissue defect or were infected. RESULTS: We identified 95 (25.89%) injuries in 70 patients (47 males; 23 females) that were not be operated. The reasons were lack of specific implants (no implant group; N = 33), no treatment strategy for the injury (no solution group; N = 29), and patients that were lost (lost patient group; N = 33), almost equally distributed by 1/3. In the no implant group were mainly closed fractures and fractures of the pelvis and the proximal femur. The implants needed were locking plates (N = 19), proximal femoral nails (N = 8), and implants for pelvic surgery (N = 6). In the no solution group were nearly all bone (P < 0.0000), soft tissue defects (P < 0.00001) and infections (P = 0.00003) compared to the rest and more open fractures (P < 0.00001). In the lost patients group, most fractures were closed (24 out of 33, P = 0.033). These fractures were mostly not urgent and were postponed repeatedly. CONCLUSION: One quarter of the patients did not receive the surgical treatment needed. Besides acquisition of implants, surgical skills and expertise could be a solution for this issue. Nevertheless, these skills must be passed to local surgeons.","Wichlas, F.; Hofmann, V.; Moursy, M.; Strada, G.; Deininger, C.",Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,256,1

Although online-delivered PMPs enhance access, none have been codesigned with patients or compared with group-based, in-person PMPs. This non-inferiority trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a cocreated, culturally appropriate, online-delivered PMP (iSelf-help) compared with in-person PMP in reducing pain-related disability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed-methods, using a modified participatory action research (PAR) framework, involving three phases. Phase I involved cocreation and cultural appropriateness of iSelf-help by PAR team members. Phase II: The proposed iSelf-help trial is a pragmatic, multicentred, assessor-blinded, two-arm, parallel group, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Adults (n=180, age ≥18 years) with persistent non-cancer pain eligible for a PMP will be recruited and block randomised (with equal probabilities) to intervention (iSelf-help) and control groups (in-person PMP).

Uganda hosts 1.3 million refugees, of which 60% are aged under 18. There are knowledge gaps regarding HIV testing facilitators and barriers, including HIV and intersecting stigmas, among urban refugee youth. In response, we explored experiences and perspectives towards HIV testing strategies, including HIV self‐testing, with urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: We implemented a qualitative study with refugee cisgender youth aged 16 to 24 living in Kampala's informal settlements from February‐April 2019. We conducted five focus groups with refugee youth, including two with adolescent boys and young men, two with adolescent girls and young women and one with female sex workers. We also conducted five key informant (KI) interviews with government, non‐government and community refugee agencies and HIV service providers. We conducted thematic analyses to understand HIV testing experiences, perspectives and recommendations. RESULTS: Participants (n = 49) included young men (n = 17) and young women (n = 27) originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] (n = 29), Rwanda (n = 11), Burundi (n = 3) and Sudan (n = 1), in addition to five KI (gender: n = 3 women, n = 2 men; country of origin: n = 2 Rwanda, n = 2 Uganda, n = 1 DRC). Participant narratives revealed stigma drivers included fear of HIV infection; misinformation that HIV is a “Ugandan disease”; and blame and shame for sexual activity. Stigma facilitators included legal precarity regarding sex work, same‐sex practices and immigration status, alongside healthcare mistreatment and confidentiality concerns. Stigma experiences were attributed to the social devaluation of intersecting identities (sex work, youth, refugees, sexual minorities, people living with HIV, women). Participants expressed high interest in HIV self‐testing. They recommended HIV self‐testing implementation strategies to be peer supported and expressed concerns regarding sexual‐ and gender‐based violence with partner testing. CONCLUSIONS: Intersecting stigma rooted in fear, misinformation, blame and shame, legal precarity and healthcare mistreatment constrain current HIV testing strategies with urban refugee youth. Findings align with the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework that conceptualizes stigma drivers and facilitators that devalue intersecting health conditions and social identities. Findings can inform multi‐level strategies to foster enabling HIV testing environments with urban refugee youth, including tackling intersecting stigma and leveraging refugee youth peer support.","Logie, Carmen H; Okumu, Moses; Kibuuka Musoke, Daniel; Hakiza, Robert; Mwima, Simon; Kyambadde, Peter; Abela, Heather; Gittings, Lesley; Musinguzi, Joshua; Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Baral, Stefan",J Int AIDS Soc,256,1

METHODS: We included in a prospective observational study all consecutive adults with aquaporin 4 (AQP4) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody–positive disorders treated with RTX. Dosing schedule was adapted to memory B-cell measurement. RESULTS: We included 48 patients (mean age 47 [SD: 14] years; 77% females; 31 AQP4 positive and 17 MOG positive). The median follow-up was 3.6 years (range: 0.9–8.1 years). The median number of RTX infusions was 8 (range: 2–14). The median dosing interval was 6 months (range: 1.7–13.7 months). Sixty-seven symptomatic infections (SIs) were observed in 26 of 48 (54%) patients, including 13 severe infections in 9 (19%). Urinary and lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent, representing 42% and 21% of SI. At RTX onset, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was abnormal in 3 of 48 (6%) patients. After RTX, 15 (31%), 11 (23%), 3 (6%), and 0 of 48 patients showed sustained IgG level <7, <6, <4, and <2 g/L, respectively. On multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the main variables explaining the risk of SI were the presence of urinary tract dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR] = 34, 95% CI 4–262, p < 0.001), the dosing intervals (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99, p < 0.001), and the interaction between IgG level and urinary tract dysfunction (HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.53–0.85, p < 0.005).

In 2018, there were only approximately ten tetanus cases reported in Indonesia. Despite widespread vaccination, especially in low–middle-income countries, tetanus still occurs (mostly in adults) due to the lack of immunization related to religious tenets, cultural belief, or inaccessibility to medical care. In addition, tetanus in the pediatric population shows features which are quite distinct from the adult group. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 7-year-old girl presented to our institution with a history of falling 10 days prior to admission, with only skin laceration on her forehead. For 1 day prior to admission, the patient looked drowsy and difficult to be awakened, accompanied with stiffness of her jaw; we diagnosed her as an unimmunized child with an open depressed skull fracture of her frontal bone and wound infection complicated with “lockjaw.” Perioperative management of this rare case is reported and discussed. CONCLUSION: The pediatric intensive care of such patients requires halting further toxin production, neutralization of circulating toxin, and control of the clinical manifestation induced by the toxin that has already gained access to the central nervous system. The basic tenets of anesthetic care in such case must be well-managed and planned prior to surgery.","Hakim, Dzulfikar D.

The broad dynamic range was achieved by differential coating of two identical GMR sensors operated in tandem, and combining two standard curves. The detection limit was determined as 5 pg/mL. The assay, involving 53 plasma samples from patients with different cardiovascular diseases, was validated against the Roche Cobas e411 analyzer. The salient features of this system are its wide concentration range, low detection limit, small sample volume requirement (50 μL), and the need for a short measurement time of 15 min, making it a prospective candidate for practical use in point of care analysis.","Meng, Fanda; Huo, Weisong; Lian, Jie; Zhang, Lei; Shi, Xizeng; Jesorka, Aldo; Gao, Yunhua",Anal Bioanal Chem,256,13

However, Eilat virus (EILV) is defective for infecting vertebrate cells at multiple levels of the viral life cycle. This host-restriction property renders EILV an attractive expression platform since it is not infectious for vertebrates and therefore provides a highly advantageous safety profile. Here, we investigated the feasibility of versatile EILV-based expression vectors. By replacing the structural genes of EILV with those of other alphaviruses, we generated seven different chimeras. These chimeras were readily rescued in the original mosquito cells and were able to reach high titers, suggesting that EILV is capable of packaging the structural proteins of different lineages. We also explored the ability of EILV to express authentic antigens via double subgenomic (SG) RNA vectors. Four foreign genetic materials of varied length were introduced into the EILV genome, and the expressed heterologous genetic materials were readily detected in the infected cells. By inserting an additional SG promoter into the chimera genome containing the structural genes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we developed a bivalent vaccine candidate against CHIKV and Zika virus. These data demonstrate the outstanding compatibility of the EILV genome. The produced recombinants can be applied to vaccine and diagnostic tool development, but more investigations are required.","Tan, Lu; Zhang, Yiwen; Wang, Xingxing; Kim, Dal Young",Viruses,256,22

However, no such research have been published in the literature, particularly using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The aim of this study is to build an ANN model with an app for automatic prediction and classification of HOF for NBA players. We downloaded 4728 NBA players’ data of career stats and accolades from the website at basketball-reference.com. The training sample was collected from 85 HOF members and 113 retired Non-HOF players based on completed data and a longer career length (≥15 years). Featured variables were taken from the higher correlation coefficients (<0.1) with HOF and significant deviations apart from the two HOF/Non-HOF groups using logistical regression. Two models (i.e., ANN and convolutional neural network, CNN) were compared in model accuracy (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC). An app predicting HOF was then developed involving the model’s parameters. We observed that (1) 20 feature variables in the ANN model yielded a higher AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.93–0.97) based on the 198-case training sample, (2) the ANN performed better than CNN on the accuracy of AUC (= 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.95), and (3) an ready and available app for predicting HOF was successfully developed. The 20-variable ANN model with the 53 parameters estimated by the ANN for improving the accuracy of HOF has been developed. The app can help NBA fans to predict their players likely to be inducted into the HOF and is not just limited to the active NBA players.","Chou, Po-Hsin; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yang, Ting-Ya; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chou, Willy; Yeh, Chao-Hung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,256,1

However, there is a lack of a review systematically synthesising empirical studies that have examined these associations. Hence, the aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of evidence from observational studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Three electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL) will be searched (presumably in May 2021), and reference lists of included studies will be searched manually. Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies examining the association between informal caregiving for adults and loneliness or social isolation will be included. Studies focusing on grandchildren care or private care for chronically ill children will be excluded. Data extraction will include information related to study design, definition and measurement of informal caregiving, loneliness and social isolation, sample characteristics, statistical analysis and main results. The quality of the studies will be evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Two reviewers will perform the selection of studies, data extraction and assessment of study quality. Figures and tables will be used to summarise and report results. A narrative summary of the findings will be provided. If data permit, a meta-analysis will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No primary data will be collected.

18050,18050,18050,Upcoming Events in Pediatric Cardiology Pediatric Cardiology 42–2,14.931118,7.0545316,2021-06-03,"Analyses of human clinical HIV-1 vaccine trials and preclinical vaccine studies performed in rhesus macaque (RM) models have identified associations between non-neutralizing Fc Receptor (FcR)-dependent antibody effector functions and reduced risk of infection. Specifically, antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) has emerged as a common correlate of reduced infection risk in multiple RM studies and the human HVTN505 trial. This recurrent finding suggests that antibody responses with the capability to mediate ADP are most likely a desirable component of vaccine responses aimed at protecting against HIV-1 acquisition. As use of RM models is essential for development of the next generation of candidate HIV-1 vaccines, there is a need to determine how effectively ADP activity observed in RMs translates to activity in humans. In this study we compared ADP activity of human and RM monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to bridge this gap in knowledge. We observed considerable variability in the magnitude of monocyte and PMN ADP activity across individual humans and RM that was not dependent on FcR alleles, and only modestly impacted by cell-surface levels of FcRs. Importantly, we found that for both human and RM phagocytes, ADP activity of antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site was greatest when mediated by human IgG3, followed by RM and human IgG1. These results demonstrate that there is functional homology between antibody and FcRs from these two species for ADP. We also used novel RM IgG1 monoclonal antibodies engineered with elongated hinge regions to show that hinge elongation augments RM ADP activity. The RM IgGs with engineered hinge regions can achieve ADP activity comparable to that observed with human IgG3. These novel modified antibodies will have utility in passive immunization studies aimed at defining the role of IgG3 and ADP in protection from virus challenge or control of disease in RM models. Our results contribute to a better translation of human and macaque antibody and FcR biology, and may help to improve testing accuracy and evaluations of future active and passive prevention strategies.","Pollara, Justin; Tay, Matthew Zirui; Edwards, R.

Given the racial differences in genetic variations, it would be desirable to establish a PDX library from Japanese cancer patients on a large scale. We thus tried to construct the Japanese PDX (J‐PDX) library with a detailed clinical information for further clinical utilization. Between August 2018 and May 2020, a total of 1126 cancer specimens from 1079 patients were obtained at the National Cancer Center Hospital and National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan, and were immediately transplanted to immunodeficient mice at the National Cancer Center Research Institute. A total of 298 cross‐cancer PDXs were successfully established. The time to engraftment varied greatly by cancer subtypes, especially in the first passage. The engraftment rate was strongly affected by the clinical stage and survival time of the original patients. Approximately 1 year was needed from tumor collection to the time when coclinical trials were conducted to test the clinical utility. The 1‐year survival rates of the patients who were involved in establishing the PDX differed significantly, from 95.6% for colorectal cancer to 56.3% for lung cancer. The J‐PDX library consisting of a wide range of cancer subtypes has been successfully established as a platform for drug discovery and development in Japan.

These disruptive events that happen in the world each day result in damage to individuals, families, and communities. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted. All frontline health-care providers at the emergency departments of Amhara Regional State Referral Hospitals during the study period were considered as studied subjects. Data were collected through a self-administered technique. Once all essential data were collected, data were coded and entered into epidata manager (v4.6.0.2) statistical software. SPSS version 26 was used to analyze the findings of this paper. RESULTS: The result of this research study showed that 66.7% were males and 33.3% were females with mean age of respondents being 31.2 ± 5.8. Among respondents, 54% (52.9) % did not have an understanding of disaster preparedness. As a result, the majority of participants, 52 (51%), have inadequate knowledge. Most respondents have adequate attitude (57.8%) and only a few, 12 (11.8%), of respondents were very familiar with regard to disaster and disaster handling preparedness. In multivariate logistic regression, receiving training on the subject (P = 0.000, AOR: 15.109. 95% CI: 3.525–64.769), respondents receiving simulation in the subject of disaster (P = 0.015, AOR: 4.855, 95% CI: 1.366–17.260) and having a direct personal/professional experience of disaster (P = 0.003, AOR: 5.703, 95% CI: 1.825–17.823) were significantly associated. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Disaster handling preparedness, knowledge and familiarity levels were below those expected for emergency department nurses.

18518,18518,18518,Towards the elimination of cervical cancer in Japan,15.0380535,7.191153,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an extremely prevalent and debilitating mental health disorder. Currently, the gold standard treatment for GAD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. The most common medications used to treat GAD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. While CBT is the gold standard treatment for GAD, it is costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible. Fortunately, the electronic delivery of CBT (e-CBT) has emerged as a promising solution to address these barriers. e-CBT has shown to offer comparable results to in-person CBT while improving accessibility for patients and time efficiency for clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the treatment efficacy of e-CBT compared to and in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for GAD. METHODS: This study will use a quasi-experimental design to allow patients the freedom to choose which treatment modality they would like to receive. Participants with a diagnosis of GAD will be enrolled in 1 of 3 possible treatment arms: (1) e-CBT, (2) medication, or (3) a combination of e-CBT and medication. The e-CBT program will include a 12-week psychotherapy program delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool—a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. The treatment efficacy of e-CBT will be compared with that of medication alone and medication in combination with e-CBT. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in April 2019 and participant recruitment began in June 2019. Participant recruitment has been conducted through social media advertisements, physical advertisements, and physician referrals. To date, 146 participants (e-CBT: n=53; medication: n=49; combination: n=44) have been recruited. Data collection is expected to conclude by June 2021, and data analysis is expected to be completed by October 2021. Linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression (for categorical outcomes) analysis will be conducted using interpretive qualitative methods. CONCLUSIONS: If either the efficacy of e-CBT is shown to be comparable to that of medication or the effects of both treatments are augmented when used in tandem, these findings could have major implications on the mental health care system. e-CBT is a more accessible and affordable treatment that could increase mental health care capacity 4-fold if proven viable.

Optimization of the selected composition of SNEDDS was conducted using a D-optimal mixture design. SNEDDS was prepared by loading 150 mg/mL of PE in oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant phases. The thermodynamic stability test was carried out with phase separation parameters followed by the robustness to dilution and accelerated stability test. The immunostimulant activity was examined in vitro and in vivo by determining the phagocytic activity, cell proliferation, production of nitrite oxide levels of RAW 264.7 cells, phagocytic activity of macrophages, and the number of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The formula optimization showed that the formula containing Capryol-90, Cremophor RH40, and PEG 400 at a ratio of 30: 34: 36 was optimum. The verification response of the optimum formula with drug loading showed that the transmittance, droplet size, and zeta potential were 96.90 ± 0.00%, 28.7 ± 1.20 nm, and −56.5 ± 2.05 mV, respectively. The thermodynamic stability test and robustness to dilution did not find any separation phase. The accelerated stability test results were classified as stable. The in vitro and in vivo immunostimulant activity test showed that PE-loaded SNEDDS exhibited a higher immunostimulant effect than PE. In conclusion, the optimum and stable composition of PE loaded SNEDDS was found with a simple and accurate method using the D-Optimal mixture design and demonstrated an immunostimulant activity.","Fitria, Annisa; Hanifah, Suci; Chabib, Lutfi; Uno, Adnan Muhammad; Munawwarah, Hodijatul; Atsil, Nur; Pohara, Hendry Aditya; Weuanggi, Dwi Amalia; Syukri, Yandi",Saudi Pharm J,256,31

The morbidity of HIV patients is due to its association with opportunistic infections among which oral candidiasis is common. Regardless of HIV status, candidiasis can prevail when their immune system is depressed. Oral candidiasis can thus serve as a useful marker for both restoration of immune functions and HIV disease progression. Routine identification of Candida species is laborious and time-consuming. HICHROM agar stains different species into different colors facilitating rapid reliable identification of candida species as they differ in their virulence and sensitivity to antifungal drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes a total of 200 HIV seropositive patients from Anti-Retroviral Therapy Centre, West Godavari District. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected in a screw-capped universal container. Five microliters of each sample using a sterile inoculating loop is streaked on the chromogenic agar culture media. The colonies formed are counted using a magnifying glass and LAPIZ colony counter. Candidal colony-forming units per milliliter were analyzed, compared and correlated among different study groups. Different candida species were also identified in the study. RESULTS: Nonalbicans Candida was the most common species isolated in our study accounting for 53% and Candida albicans accounting for 47%. Considering initial and final CD4 counts, there is improvement in patients on retroviral therapy. CONCLUSION: Identification of the species is important for epidemiological reasons and for treatment purposes to ensure a better prognosis since some species present reduced susceptibility to azoles.","Mounika, R.; Nalabolu, Govindraj K.; Pallavi, N.; Birajdar, Smita S.",J Oral Maxillofac Pathol,256,1

Herein we review randomized trials and meta-analyses published during the last 20 years on the results of bariatric/metabolic surgery in obese patients with type 2 diabetes with the aim of highlighting the scientific evidence available. Several studies and RCTs in the last 20 years have showed outstanding results of bariatric/metabolic surgery on Type II diabetes and comorbidities in patients with either BMI > 35 kg/m(2) or BMI < 35 kg/m(2). They have established that bariatric procedures are superior to non-surgical interventions for inducing weight loss and amelioration of type 2 diabetes, even in patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m(2). The physiopatologic changes that improve glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery remain unclear but glycemic control is improved after sleeve gastrectomy, duodenal-jejunal bypass, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass, and biliopancreatic diversion. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the various gastrointestinal procedures may have different effects and mechanisms of action. Metabolic surgery will help integrate knowledge and multidisciplinary expertise to provide a combination of conservative and surgical treatments for Type II diabetes.

Apart from patients with obvious EI, the identification of a such behavior during a real-life consultation is unreliable. We therefore describe a machine learning algorithm to screen for EI, as actimetry measurements are difficult to implement. Complete datasets for 1409 COPD patients were obtained from COLIBRI-COPD, a database of clinicopathological data submitted by French pulmonologists. Patient- and pulmonologist-reported estimates of PA quantity (daily walking time) and intensity (domestic, recreational, or fitness-directed) were first used to assign patients to one of four PA groups (extremely inactive [EI], overtly active [OA], intermediate [INT], inconclusive [INC]). The algorithm was developed by (i) using data from 80% of patients in the EI and OA groups to identify ‘phenotype signatures’ of non-PA-related clinical variables most closely associated with EI or OA; (ii) testing its predictive validity using data from the remaining 20% of EI and OA patients; and (iii) applying the algorithm to identify EI patients in the INT and INC groups. The algorithm’s overall error for predicting EI status among EI and OA patients was 13.7%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% confidence intervals: 0.75–0.92). Of the 577 patients in the INT/INC groups, 306 (53%) were reclassified as EI by the algorithm. Patient- and physician- reported estimation may underestimate EI in a large proportion of COPD patients.

Currently, industry favours Protein A affinity chromatography (PrAc) as the key step in downstream processing of mAbs. This step, although highly efficient, represents a significant mAb production cost. Fouling of the Protein A column and Protein A ligand leaching contribute to the cost of mAb production by shortening the life span of the resin. In this study, we assessed the performance of used PrAc resin recovered from the middle inlet, center and outlet as well as the side inlet of a pilot-scale industrial column. We used a combination of static binding capacity (SBC) analysis and Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to explore the used resin samples. SBC analysis demonstrated that resin from the inlet of the column had lower binding capacity than resin from the column outlet. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with PLS (partial least square) analysis confirmed the results obtained from SBC analysis. Importantly, in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy also allowed both measurement of the concentration and assessment of the conformational state of the bound Protein A. Our results reveal that PrAc resin degradation after use is dependent on column location and that neither Protein A ligand leaching nor denaturation are responsible for binding capacity loss.","Beattie, James W.; Rowland-Jones, Ruth C.; Farys, Monika; Tran, Richard; Kazarian, Sergei G.; Byrne, Bernadette",,256,1

When new DBZDs are identified, very limited information is available on their pharmacodynamics. Here, computational models (i.e., quantitative structure-activity relationship/QSAR and Molecular Docking) were used to analyse DBZDs identified online by an automated web crawler (NPSfinder(®)) and to predict their possible activity/affinity on the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA-ARs). The computational software MOE was used to calculate 2D QSAR models, perform docking studies on crystallised GABA-A receptors (6HUO, 6HUP) and generate pharmacophore queries from the docking conformational results. 101 DBZDs were identified online by NPSfinder(®). The validated QSAR model predicted high biological activity values for 41% of these DBDZs. These predictions were supported by the docking studies (good binding affinity) and the pharmacophore modelling confirmed the importance of the presence and location of hydrophobic and polar functions identified by QSAR. This study confirms once again the importance of web-based analysis in the assessment of drug scenarios (DBZDs), and how computational models could be used to acquire fast and reliable information on biological activity for index novel DBZDs, as preliminary data for further investigations.","Catalani, Valeria; Botha, Michelle; Corkery, John Martin; Guirguis, Amira; Vento, Alessandro; Scherbaum, Norbert; Schifano, Fabrizio",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),256,22

Poor-quality oocytes, along with lower cleavage and implantation rates, reduce fertilization. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine crucial molecular mechanisms behind PCOS pathogenesis and repurpose new drug candidates interacting with them. To predict a more in-depth insight, we applied a novel bioinformatics approach to analyze interactions between the drug-related and PCOS proteins in PCOS patients. METHODS: The newest proteomics data was retrieved from 16 proteomics datasets and was used to construct the PCOS PPI network using Cytoscape. The topological network analysis determined hubs and bottlenecks. The MCODE Plugin was used to identify highly connected regions, and the associations between PCOS clusters and drug-related proteins were evaluated using the Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test. The crucial PPI hub-bottlenecks and the shared molecules (between the PCOS clusters and drug-related proteins) were then investigated for their drug-protein interactions with previously US FDA-approved drugs to predict new drug candidates. RESULTS: The PI3K/AKT pathway was significantly related to one PCOS subnetwork and most drugs (metformin, letrozole, pioglitazone, and spironolactone); moreover, VEGF, EGF, TGFB1, AGT, AMBP, and RBP4 were identified as the shared proteins between the PCOS subnetwork and the drugs. The shared top biochemical pathways between another PCOS subnetwork and rosiglitazone included metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, and citrate cycle, while the shared proteins included HSPB1, HSPD1, ACO2, TALDO1, VDAC1, and MDH2. We proposed some new candidate medicines for further PCOS treatment investigations, such as copper and zinc compounds, reteplase, alteplase, gliclazide, Etc. CONCLUSION: Some of the crucial molecules suggested by our model have already been experimentally reported as critical molecules in PCOS pathogenesis. Moreover, some repurposed medications have already shown beneficial effects on infertility treatment. These previous experimental reports confirm our suggestion for investigating our other repurposed drugs (in vitro and in vivo).

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels. METHODS: We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level. FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 12·2 million (95% UI 11·0–13·6) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (93·2–111) prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133–153) DALYs due to stroke, and 6·55 million (6·00–7·02) deaths from stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (11·6% [10·8–12·2] of total deaths) and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined (5·7% [5·1–6·2] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of incident strokes increased by 70·0% (67·0–73·0), prevalent strokes increased by 85·0% (83·0–88·0), deaths from stroke increased by 43·0% (31·0–55·0), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 32·0% (22·0–42·0). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 17·0% (15·0–18·0), mortality decreased by 36·0% (31·0–42·0), prevalence decreased by 6·0% (5·0–7·0), and DALYs decreased by 36·0% (31·0–42·0). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 22·0% (21·0–24·0) and incidence rates increased by 15·0% (12·0–18·0). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 3·6 (3·5–3·8) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 3·7 (3·5–3·9) times higher in the low-income group than the high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 62·4% of all incident strokes in 2019 (7·63 million [6·57–8·96]), while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 27·9% (3·41 million [2·97–3·91]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 9·7% (1·18 million [1·01–1·39]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 79·6 million [67·7–90·8] DALYs or 55·5% [48·2–62·0] of total stroke DALYs), high body-mass index (34·9 million [22·3–48·6] DALYs or 24·3% [15·7–33·2]), high fasting plasma glucose (28·9 million [19·8–41·5] DALYs or 20·2% [13·8–29·1]), ambient particulate matter pollution (28·7 million [23·4–33·4] DALYs or 20·1% [16·6–23·0]), and smoking (25·3 million [22·6–28·2] DALYs or 17·6% [16·4–19·0]). INTERPRETATION: The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly in low-income countries.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We built a cohort of 36 638 new users of SGLT2i and 209 025 new users of other antihyperglycemics. Inverse probability weighting was used to estimate the excess rate of eGFR dip, risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or all‐cause mortality, and risk of the composite kidney outcome of eGFR decline >50%, end‐stage kidney disease, or all‐cause mortality. In the first 6 months of therapy, compared with other antihyperglycemics, excess rates of eGFR dip >10% and eGFR dip >30% were 9.86 (95% CI: 8.83–11.00) and 1.15 (0.70–1.62) per 100 SGLT2i users, respectively. In mediation analyses that accounted for eGFR dipping, SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.92 [0.84–0.99] and 0.78 [0.71–0.87], respectively); the magnitude of the association reduced by eGFR dipping was small for both outcomes. SGLT2i was associated with reduced risk of both outcomes in those with higher than average probability of eGFR dip >10% or 30%. Compared with discontinuation, continued use of SGLT2i at 6 months was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in those with no eGFR dip or eGFR dip ≤10%, in those with eGFR dip >10%, and in those with eGFR dip >30%. CONCLUSIONS: The salutary association of SGLT2i with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes was maintained regardless of eGFR dipping; concerns about eGFR dipping should not preclude use, and occurrence of eGFR dip after SGLT2i initiation may not warrant discontinuation.","Xie, Yan; Bowe, Benjamin; Gibson, Andrew K.; McGill, Janet B.; Maddukuri, Geetha; Al‐Aly, Ziyad",J Am Heart Assoc,256,1

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 108 uremia patients undergoing PD who were admitted to the First People's Hospital of Wenling from March 2018 to December 2020. In accordance with the wishes of the patients, according to random number method, the patients were divided into control group (n = 54) and experimental group (n = 54). Patients in the control group were given routine care. Patients in the experimental group were given MBSR combined with SFBT. The clinical data, biochemical indicators, complication, compliance, nutritional status, and quality of life of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: After intervention, the serum hemoglobin, serum albumin levels, and urea clearance index of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the experimental group had a lower incidence of complications (P < 0.05). After intervention, the compliance score of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). After intervention, the malnutrition inflammation score of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). After intervention, the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life-36 scores of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MBSR combined with SFBT has a good nursing effect in uremia patients undergoing PD and can increase the patient's treatment compliance, improve the quality of life, and improve the nutritional status.","Wang, Yiqian; Lin, Huazhi; Wang, Lihua; Cao, Jun; Zheng, Dan; Zhu, Jing",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,256,1

Since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict, the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic. The highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Many patients with SARS-CoV experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died. Similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and West Nile Virus, the severity of SARS-CoV disease increased with age. Unfortunately, successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging (immune senescence). Due to the rapidity of virus emergence, technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology, pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult, candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection, and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation. We discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human SARS-CoV has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases. In addition, we review the evolution, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of epidemic and zoonotic SARS-CoV with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoonotic pool.","Sheahan, Timothy P.; Baric, Ralph S.",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,256,7

It is important for the management at such destinations to prepare for, and respond to, health- and life-threatening infectious diseases, to mitigate any negative impact on local economy and society. Mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue, are rapidly spreading globally, including in Bali, Indonesia. However, travellers tend to be unaware of the health threats resulting from mosquito bites. Increased dengue incidence amongst travellers could also result in exposure of the local people to the infection. Traversing the disciplines of Travel Medicine, Entomology and Business Administration, we carried out a study comprising fieldwork and literature analyses, to address the proposed empowerment of hotels to disseminate information on dengue prevention and control to international travellers. The fieldwork included an outreach workshop and questionnaire, conducted by partnering the local health authorities and hotel association. Additionally, we carried out site visits to several hotels. The questionnaire revealed that only 67% of the participating hotel personnel know that dengue is mosquito-borne. Eighty-three percent of the facilities reported mosquito nuisance problems, and fogging was the most utilised control measure of choice. Our analyses indicate that there is a role for the hotel sector in promoting anti-dengue awareness and activities in Bali. Such an initiative could assist Bali to work towards the good health and well-being for the sustainable development goals. Our follow-up studies will include capacity building for risk communication to international travellers, and for mosquito control at hotels.","Yoshikawa, Minako Jen; Kusriastuti, Rita; Liew, Christina",,256,17

The idea is to recommend answerers, who are credited the highest expertise under question tags at routing time. The expertise of answerers under already replied question tags is intuitively discounted by accounting for the observed tags, votes and temporal information of their answers. Instead, the discounted expertise under not yet replied tags is predicted via a latent-factor representation of both answerers and tags. These representations are inferred by means of Gibbs sampling under a new Bayesian probabilistic model of discounted user expertise and asking-answering behavior. The devised model unprecedentedly explains the latter two CQA aspects as the result of a generative process, that seamlessly integrates probabilistic matrix factorization and network behavior characterization.

Thus, a richer class of measures is now considered.","Díaz, Susana; Díaz, Irene; Montes, Susana",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,256,1

The present article addresses the design and development of a human breathing assist machine (ventilator) prototype for use by qualified medical professionals in the emergency room, as well as in other locations, where a regular ventilator machine cannot be made available. The ventilator has been designed using readily available locally sourced materials, which can be assembled in a short time. This ensures the minimum required features to ventilate a patient in emergency conditions. The popular crank-rocker mechanism has been used to meet some of the vital design requirements of the emergency ventilator. The size of the links has been chosen to maintain a fixed inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) time ratio of 1:2. The kinematic linkage design has been kept modular by introducing a feature to adjust the location of the rocker tip to control the tidal volume from 100 ml to 600 ml of oxygenated air per breath. A virtual CAD model, based on the above-mentioned linkage design, has been designed to assess the variation of the position and velocity with time. Finally, a working prototype has been made, and it was observed that the I:E time ratio of 1:2 was achieved satisfactorily.","Tharion, J.; Kapil, S.; Muthu, N.; Tharion, J.

The preterm postnatal follow-up study (PPFS) of the Intergrowth-21st Project provides new growth standards based on a longitudinal study. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of extrautrine growth restriction (EUGR) and the associated factors of EUGR in preterm infants, using the PPFS charts and the Fenton charts. Data of 1,356 infants with gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks from the Korean Neonatal Network were analysed. The prevalence of small for gestational age (SGA) of weight and length was higher with the Intergrowth charts than with the Fenton charts. EUGR in weight and length was more prevalent when using the Fenton charts. Multivariate analysis showed that low GA, high birthweight z score, male, treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage and duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) were associated with EUGR in weight by the Intergrowth charts. High birthweight z score, treated PDA and PN duration were associated with EUGR defined by the Fenton charts. Conclusion: Compared to the Fenton charts, SGA was more defined and EUGR was less prevalent in extremely low gestational infants, while EUGR defined by the Intergrowth charts categorized infants with adverse clinical courses more elaborately.

However, the development of adequate, affordable, and accessible treatments is mostly neglected, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality that could otherwise be averted. Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania parasite and transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies. No systematic review and meta-analysis has been done to identify the prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis to the authors’ knowledge. Therefore, the objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of human leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. METHODS: Eleven studies conducted in all regions of Ethiopia, which were fully accessible, written in any language, and original articles done on prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis, were included. STATA™ version 11.1 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square, I(2), and p values were assessed to check heterogeneity. A random effects model with heterogeneity taken from an inverse-variance model was employed to estimate the pooled effect. Subgroup meta-analysis was computed to reduce random variations among each article’s point prevalence, and Egger and funnel plots were used to check for publication bias. RESULTS: The highest proportion of human leishmaniasis was reported from a study done in Amhara region (39.1%), and the lowest was reported from a survey done in Tigray (2.3%). The overall pooled prevalence of leishmaniasis was 9.13% (95% CI 5–13.27). Subgroup analysis by region revealed moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 51.8%) in studies conducted in the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). The presence of hyraxes and being male were associated with an increased risk of human leishmaniasis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia remains high (9.13%), with significant risk factors being male and the presence of hyraxes within a 300-m radius of the sleeping area.","Haftom, Mekonnen; Petrucka, Pammla; Gemechu, Kbrom; Nesro, Jemila; Amare, Embay; Hailu, Tsegu; Ashebir, Yohannes; Gebreheat, Gdiom; Hagos, Haftea; Gebremedhin, Destaalem; Gebremariam, Alem",Infect Dis Ther,256,20

The respondents were mainly neurosurgeons, as well as radiotherapists and pathologists in general hospitals and specialized hospitals in 29 provinces and municipalities in China. The survey results are summarized as follows. Firstly, the number of outpatient and inpatient of neurological tumors significantly declined during the epidemic compared with the same period last year in more than 90% of hospitals surveyed, and a few specialized hospitals even stopped treatment due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Compelled by illness was the main reason for most of the patients to go to hospital. As the epidemic prevention and controlling, the normal treatment process for each patient was tedious than that for the same period before, and the costing time also turned longer. Most patients might feel poor medical experience, but they also expressed understanding for the hospital and cooperated with the diagnosis and treatment works. Secondly, during the epidemic period, the participation in academic conferences or MDT decreased significantly for most doctors, and scientific research work even stopped in some hospitals. Online tools have risen as the primary means of communication, not only for academic communication but also for diagnosis and treatment works. More than 90% of doctors believe the style of online communication was a new mode in this special period, with advantages such as convenient and quick.

Given that brain tumors often straddle the line between elective and emergent procedures, the pandemic has presented unique challenges to the neuro-oncology community. Here, we present our institutional protocols to (1) maintain an active outpatient neuro-oncology practice, (2) triage surgical cases under limited operating room availability, and (3) safely resume research efforts. METHODS: Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, we based the development of our protocols on the Delphi system to achieve consensus across a multi-disciplinary panel of experts. Specifically, we used this system to develop (1) a standardized physical examination that could be implemented over tele-medicine and (2) a triage system for surgical cases. Research efforts were largely suspended in the early days of the pandemic, however protocols for enrollment in clinical trials as well as the resumption of benchwork were also developed. RESULTS: From the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order (March, 2020) through May 2020, our department performed 96 surgeries for the resection of brain tumors compared to 127 such surgeries from the three months prior. During this time, using a modified Delphi procedure, we developed detailed protocols to triage tumor cases. Implementation of telemedicine outpatient visits allowed the continuation of the neuro-oncology clinic and, ultimately, the resumption of clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The protocols presented here offer several strategies to continue neuro-oncological care during the pandemic, including the surgical treatment of brain tumors. As we prepare for future outbreaks, these treatment algorithms will help ensure that patients with brain tumors receive the highest level of care independent of COVID-19.","Burke, John; Aghi, Manish; Chan, Andrew; Mummaneni, Praveen; Berger, Mitchel",Neuro Oncol,256,1

Between April and May 2020, 6,938 US adults aged 55+ completed online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national cohort study of older adults’ mental health and well-being. Multinomial logistic regression estimated self-reported changes in the frequency of alcohol consumption relative to before the pandemic, according to anxiety (5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale). All models were population-weighted and adjusted for confounders. Nearly half (46%) of adults reported drinking 1-7 drinks/week prior to the pandemic, 12% reported drinking 8+ drinks/week, and 42% reported not drinking. One in five adults (21%) reported a change in their alcohol consumption since the start of the pandemic, while 38% indicated they were drinking the same amount, and 42% reported not drinking alcohol. Older adults who screened positive for each of anxiety, depression, and loneliness reported drinking more than usual (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.92–1.93 for anxiety; OR=2.67; 95% CI: 2.67–2.68 for depression; OR=2.46; 95% CI: 2.45–2.46 for loneliness), compared to drinking the same as before the pandemic.

To analyse the key factors affecting population aging effectively and predict the development trend of population aging timely are of great significance for formulating relevant policies scientifically and reasonably, which can mitigate the effects of population aging on society. This paper analyses the current situation of population aging in Wuhan of China and discusses the main factors affecting the population aging quantitatively, and then establishes a combination prediction model to forecast the population aging trend. Firstly, considering the attribute values of the primary influence factors are multi-source heterogeneous data (the real numbers, interval numbers and fuzzy linguistic variables coexist), a two-tuple correlation coefficient analysis method is proposed to rank the importance of the influencing factors and to select the main influencing factors. Secondly, a combination prediction model named Multiple Linear Regression Analysis-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average is established to predict the number and the proportion of aging population in Wuhan. By using the statistical data of Wuhan in the past 20 years, this combination prediction model is used for empirical analysis, and a prediction result of the number and the proportion of aging people in Wuhan in the future is obtained. Based on these quantitative analysis results, we propose some countermeasures and suggestions on how to alleviate the population aging of Wuhan from aspects of economic development, pension security system design and policy formulation, which provide theoretical basis and method reference for relevant population management departments to make scientific decisions.","Rao, Congjun; Gao, Yun",Soft comput,256,16

Initiatives like Google data search and semantic web standards like Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) and Schema.org provide mechanisms to expose datasets on the web and make them findable. Apart from these standards, it is also essential to optionally explain the datasets, both its structure and applications. Metadata application profiles are a suitable mechanism to ensure interoperability and improve use-cases for datasets. Standards and attempts, including the Profiles (PROF) and VoID vocabularies, as well as frameworks like Dublin core application profiles (DCAP), provide a better understanding of developing and publishing metadata application profiles. The major challenge for domain experts, especially smaller communities intending to publish findable data on the web, is the complexities in understanding and conforming to such standards. Mostly, these features are provided by complex data repository systems, which is not always a sustainable choice for various small groups and communities looking for self-publishing their datasets. This paper attempts to utilize these standards in self-publishing findable datasets through customizing minimal static web publishing tools and demonstrating the possibilities to encourage smaller communities to adopt cost-effective and simple dataset publishing. The authors express this idea though this work-in-progress paper with the notion that such simple tools will help small communities to publish findable datasets and thus, gain more reach and acceptance for their data. From the perspective of the semantic web, such tools will improve the number of linkable datasets as well as promote the fundamental concepts of the decentralized web.","Thalhath, Nishad; Nagamori, Mitsuharu; Sakaguchi, Tetsuo; Kasaragod, Deepa; Sugimoto, Shigeo",Metadata and Semantic Research,256,6

Breaches are inevitable, attacks have become more sophisticated, and securing critical infrastructure has become a greater challenge. Anomaly detection is an established approach for detecting security attacks, without relying on predefined rules or signatures of potential attacks. However, existing outlier detection techniques require adaptation if they are to be applied in a Big Data cloud context. We describe a novel outlier detection solution, which is currently being used by hundreds of customers with highly variable data scales. We describe our work in adapting this technology to handle IoT on a Big Data cloud setting. Specifically, we focus on efficient outlier analysis and managing large numbers of alerts using automatically controlled alert budgets.","Soceanu, Omri; Adir, Allon; Aharoni, Ehud; Greenberg, Lev; Abie, Habtamu",Cyber-Physical Security for Critical Infrastructures Protection,256,16

This investigation reports on a pilot study that intended to establish the benefits of transitioning to either an online or a blended-learning modes. To this end, we firstly analysed academic performance and time spent on a set of online activities completed by language learners at beginner and upper-intermediate levels . Secondly, student location was also examined, and it was found that it has a strong relationship with academic performance based on the average grades. Statistical analyses of variance and regression models were carried out, to analyse the importance of the factors in the outcome variable. In addition, a test was done to compare performance between the study groups. Based on student location in combination with the other variables, it was possible to monitor that the students performed academically better when off-campus. This led us to the preliminary conclusion that moving to a fully online or blended-learning mode, either due to the pandemic or an independent decision, students would perform equally, if not better, than when on-campus.","Ocaña, Mauro; Mejía, Rebeca; Larrea, Carolina; Cruz, Estefanía; Santana, Leonardo; Empinotti, Marina","Artificial Intelligence, Computer and Software Engineering Advances",256,1

It is the 2nd furthermost polluted city in India with a yearly average of 59.8 µg/m(3) PM(2.5) concentrations (IQAir 2019). Kolkata recorded the highest AQI (191) from 12–19 March 2020 & the lowermost (33) on 23–24 March 2020. This is happened due to the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. As a result of the lockdowns, air and noise pollution decreased for a short period, and air and water quality, biodiversity improved due to reduced industrial and human activities. On this backdrop, the present study endeavours to explore the reason and facts of sudden decrement in the concentration of air pollutants during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to fewer vehicles and the absence of industrial activities and subsequent heavy rainfall made by cyclone Amphan landfall around Kolkata and adjacent areas, it improved air quality by its cleansing effect. It also highlights the interconnections between the air quality and socio-economics fabrics of the city and the collapse of economic activities. The impact of improved air quality on people’s social and health status is positive. The paper also prescribes how these positive impacts can be carried out for the wellbeing of society.","Rajendra, Kushagra; Yadav, Namita; Chakraborty, Dipanjana",COVID-19 Pandemic Trajectory in the Developing World,256,1

Proteins, as targeted antibodies, tiny concentrations of hormones and cytokines; many enzymes; fusion proteins and receptors; “factors” involved in blood-clotting, homeostasis, and thrombosis; and vaccines, often in recombinant form, comprise the majority of FDA- and EMA-approved biologics. Of the 51 different mAbs currently approved and many under development for the management of a variety of non-cancer diseases, mAb development continues to be extended and refined. There is a smaller list of approved cytokines, a number of which, like enzymes used in enzyme replacement therapies, have been developed as orphan drugs. These recombinant proteins are available in highly purified, well-characterized form. Some advantages of protein therapeutics over small MW drugs include specificity of action and potent therapeutic efficiency, more predictable behavior after administration, fewer side effects including the expected lower immunogenicity due to their human origin, and faster regulatory approval time. Unlike small drug molecules, protein therapeutics are typically more complex with the possibility of heterogeneity due to changes in amino acid sequence, the presence and extent of glycosylation, folding, and protein-protein interactions. Type I hypersensitivities, anaphylaxis and urticaria, are generally not often seen following conventional small molecule therapy, but both reactions are known to occur with many different biologic agents, particularly mAbs, hormones (e.g., insulin), and enzymes, including recombinant preparations used in enzyme replacement therapies. Many infusion reactions with some signs and symptoms of cytokine release syndrome, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, and direct toxicity are often less easy to define precisely and confidently. Biologics, particularly mAbs, may also provoke type II, III, and IV hypersensitivities in the form of cytopenias, autoimmunities, serum sickness, vasculitis, pulmonary events, liver injury, and cutaneous reactions, some of them severe toxidermias. A number of systemic potentially life-threatening syndromes may occur with low frequency during or following the administration of a variety of biologic agents. For most, if not all, of the rare syndromes provoked by biologics, release of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines is a common feature.","Baldo, Brian A.; Pham, Nghia H.",Drug Allergy,256,1

While there are many theoretical explanations for this bifurcation between humans and nature, there is an absence of wide-ranging solutions to address the issue. With a dramatic global shift towards a swelling urban culture driven by technology, current research strongly emphasizes the importance of nature’s health benefits. This study investigates the weakening connections between humans and the natural world and the effect that the characteristics and processes of nature-based journeys have on individual perspectives of environmental awareness and stewardship. Using qualitative research methods, nine participants from three Outward Bound Canada expeditions were interviewed to explore how outdoor journeys of at least one week in length influenced their sense of environmental connectivity and/or stewardship. Results demonstrate a positive association between participants’ exposure to natural environments and an increased sense of connection and stewardship towards nature. Participants experienced a reduced sense of fear in outdoor environments while their comfort levels in natural areas grew. Their values associated with natural areas changed, and for a few, their journeys challenged them to question their current personal and employment situation. Their journeys also augmented naturalistic understanding, increased their sense of connection with their surroundings, nurtured a desire to continue visiting natural areas and, for most, inspired their will to participate in employment or volunteer initiatives to improve the state of the environment.","Schwass, Nicholas R.; Potter, Stephanie E.; O’Connell, Timothy S.; Potter, Tom G.",Journal of Outdoor and Environmental Education,256,1

Reduced food intake combined with nutrient-poor foods served in hospitals contribute to nutritional risk. This study investigated whether reported dietary intake and disease state of hospitalized adults in critical care units was related to malnutrition determined by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Adult in-patients (n = 126) in tuberculosis, burn, oncology, and intensive care units in two public tertiary hospitals in Malawi were screened for nutritional status using MUAC and a question on current dietary intake. The hospital menu was reviewed; portion sizes were weighed. The prevalence of moderate and severe malnutrition was 62%. Patients with organ-related diseases and infectious diseases had the highest rates of reduced reported dietary intake, 71.4% and 57.9%, respectively; however, there was no association between reported dietary intake and MUAC. In those unable to eat, however, the rate of severe malnutrition was 50%. The menu consisted of porridge and thickened corn-based starch with fried cabbage; protein foods were provided twice weekly. There was a nutrient gap of 250 calories and 13 gm protein daily. The findings support the need for increasing dietetic/nutrition services to prevent and treat malnutrition in hospitals using simple screening tools.","Barcus, Grace C.; Papathakis, Peggy C.; Schaffner, Andrew; Chimera, Bernadette",Nutrients,256,1

Perceived diversity in Software Engineering has been recognized as a high-value team property and companies are willing to increase their efforts to create more diverse work teams. The current diversity state-of-the-art shows that gender diversity studies have been growing during the past decade, and they have shown the benefits of including women in software teams. However, less is known about how other perceived diversity factors such as race, nationality, disability, and age of developers are related to Software Engineering. Through a systematic literature review, we aim to clarify the research area concerned with perceived diversity in Software Engineering. Our goal is to identify (1) what issues have been studied and what results have been reported; (2) what methods, tools, models, and processes have been proposed to help perceived diversity issues; and (3) what limitations have been reported when studying perceived diversity in Software Engineering. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to identify gaps in the current literature and create a call for future action in perceived diversity in Software Engineering. Our results indicate that the individual studies have typically had a gender diversity perspective focusing on showing gender bias or gender differences instead of developing methods and tools to mitigate the gender diversity issues faced in SE. Moreover, perceived diversity aspects related to SE participants’ race, age, and disability need to be further analyzed in Software Engineering research. From our systematic literature review, we conclude that researchers need to consider a wider set of perceived diversity aspects for future research.","Rodríguez-Pérez, Gema; Nadri, Reza; Nagappan, Meiyappan",Empir Softw Eng,256,1

There are no data on the incidence of LAR in Asian subjects, or its risk factors and associated clinical outcomes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-centre case-+control study to investigate the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of LAR in Chinese kidney transplant recipients. Subjects with or without LAR were matched for age, gender, era of transplantation, allograft type, and maintenance immunosuppression regimen. RESULTS Thirty-two episodes of LAR occurred within an observation period of 12 years giving an incidence rate of 0.46 episodes per 1000 patient-years. Acute rejection within the first year after transplantation was associated with an increased risk of LAR (OR 3.59, P = 0.041). In patients receiving maintenance immunosuppression regimen with steroid, cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolate or an m-TOR inhibitor, patients with LAR showed lower trough CsA levels prior to and at the time of rejection compared to Controls (86.0 ± 26.1 vs. 105.6 ± 13.3 μg/L, P = 0.049; and 75.7 ± 35.7 vs. 106.0 ± 20.5 μg/L, P = 0.032, respectively). Trough CsA level below 80 μg/L was associated with the development of LAR (OR 10.82, P = 0.032). Patients with LAR showed an inferior allograft survival (P < 0.001) while patient survival rates were similar (P = 0.122). CONCLUSIONS Late acute rejection is uncommon in Chinese kidney transplant recipients but is associated with reduced allograft survival. Risk factors include acute rejection in the first post-transplant year and trough CsA level below 80 μg/L in patients on CsA-based maintenance immunosuppression. Minimization of immunosuppression in apparently stable kidney transplant recipients must be exercised with caution.","Mok, Maggie Ming Yee; Ma, Maggie Kam Man; Yap, Desmond Yat Hin; Chan, Gavin Sheung Wai; Lam, Man Fai; Kwok, Janette Siu Yin; Kwan, Lorraine Pui Yuen; Chan, Gary Chi Wang; Choy, Cindy Bo Ying; Tang, Sydney Chi Wai; Chan, Tak Mao",Nephrology,256,1

OBJECTIVES To describe the association between early markers of cardiovascular function and renal perfusion with AKI occurrence in a cohort of preterm infants < 32 weeks' gestation. METHODS 128 infants were prospectively included from birth to discharge. During the first day of life, we assessed cardiovascular function, systemic and organ blood flow by Doppler ultrasound, and monitored cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). These measures were analyzed in relation to developing AKI and serum creatinine (SCr) peak from day 2 to 7 of life. RESULTS 12 of 128 infants presented with AKI (9.4%). SCr peak was 155.3 ± 30.2 µmol/L in infants with AKI versus 82.0 ± 16.5 in non-AKI infants (p < 0.001). Among all measures of cardiovascular function and renal perfusion, low mean cerebral and renal rSO2 during the first day of life and a low resistive index at renal artery Doppler were significantly associated with developing AKI. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, low renal rSO2 on the first day of life remained associated with a high SCr peak from day 2 to 7 of life. CONCLUSION Low renal rSO2 values during the first day of life correlate with developing AKI in preterm infants < 32 weeks' gestation. NIRS monitoring of renal function during adaptation seems promising, and its very early use after birth to detect kidney hemodynamic dysfunction deserves further investigations.","Bonsante, Francesco; Ramful, Duksha; Binquet, Christine; Samperiz, Sylvain; Daniel, Sandrine; Gouyon, Jean-Bernard; Iacobelli, Silvia",Neonatology,256,1

Rigorous guidance based on robust research was compromised by the emergence of the pandemic and the urgency of need for guidance. Rather than aiming to ""get guidance right"", guidance developers needed to ""get guidance right now"". AIM To examine how guidance developers have responded to the need for credible guidance at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS An exploratory mixed-methods study was conducted among guidance developers. A web-based survey and follow-up interviews were used to examine the most pertinent challenges in developing COVID-19 guidance, strategies used to address these, and perspectives on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on future guidance development. RESULTS The survey was completed by 46 guidance developers. Survey findings showed that conventional methods of guidance development were largely unsuited for COVID-19 guidance, with 80% (n = 37) of respondents resorting to other methods. From the survey and five follow-up interviews, two themes were identified to bolster the credibility of guidance in a setting of extreme uncertainty: (1) strengthening end-user involvement and (2) conjoining evidence review and recommendation formulation. 70% (n = 32) of survey respondents foresaw possible changes in future guidance production, most notably shortening development time, by reconsidering how to balance between rigour and speed for different types of questions. CONCLUSION ""Getting guidance right"" and ""getting guidance right now"" are not opposites, rather uncertainties are always part of guidance development and require guidance developers to balance scientific robustness with usability, acceptability, adequacy and contingency. This crisis points to the need to acknowledge uncertainties of scientific evidence more explicitly and points to mechanisms to live with such uncertainty, thus extending guidance development methods and processes more widely.","Moleman, Marjolein; Macbeth, Fergus; Wieringa, Sietse; Forland, Frode; Shaw, Beth; Zuiderent-Jerak, Teun",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,256,0

All patients who underwent a laparoscopic LDLN from January 2015 to April 2018 in a university center were included. All surgeries were performed by three experienced surgeons. 73 patients were included: 16 underwent a 3-D laparoscopic LDLN (3-D group) and 57 underwent a 2-D laparoscopic LDLN (2-D group). Operative time and warm ischemia time (WIT) were significantly lower in the 3-D group (operative time: 80.9±10.2 versus 114.1±32.3 minutes in the 3-D and 2-D groups, p=0.0002) (WIT: 1.7±0.6 versus 2.3±0.9 minutes in the 3-D and 2-D groups, p=0.02). No conversion to open surgery occurred in both groups. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the 3-D group. No major postoperative complications (Clavien ≥III) occurred. One-year postoperative GFR was similar 3-D and 2-D groups. Our preliminary study demonstrates that 3-D laparoscopic LDLN is a feasible and safe surgical procedure.

It is based on anatomical characteristics each of which makes surgical resection of an AVM more difficult, namely, deep venous drainage, eloquence of surrounding tissue, and large nidus size. A higher score correlates with more complications after treatment. Although this grading system has proven reliable over time, it does not reflect the major determinants of risk associated with endovascular treatment. The authors developed a grading system unique to endovascular treatment of cerebral AVMs. METHODS The proposed grading system accounts for the principal AVM anatomical and physiological features that make endovascular embolization more difficult and, thus, the likelihood of complications greater. These include number of arterial pedicles, diameter of arterial pedicles, and eloquent location of AVM nidus. The proposed grading system was retrospectively applied to 50 patients undergoing endovascular AVM embolization, and its ability to predict complications was compared to the Spetzler-Martin grading system. RESULTS Perioperative complications among the 50 patients included 4 major and 9 minor complications. The proposed grading system was predictive of complication risk, with an increasing rate of perioperative complications associated with an increasing AVM grade. An improved correlation of perioperative complication incidence was noted with the proposed system (P = 0.002), when compared with the Spetzler-Martin grading system (P = 0.33). CONCLUSION This grading system for the endovascular treatment of AVMs is simple, easily reproduced, and clinically valuable.","Dumont, Travis M; Kan, Peter; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Surgical neurology international,256,27

This tradeoff is unethical. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes both chickenpox and shingles. After people recover from chickenpox, VZV remains in their nerve cells. If their immune systems become unable to suppress the virus, they develop shingles. According to the Exogenous Boosting Hypothesis (EBH), a person's ability to keep VZV suppressed can be 'boosted' through exposure to active chickenpox infections. We argue that even if this hypothesis were true, immunization policies that discourage routine childhood varicella vaccination in order to prevent shingles for other people are unethical. Such policies harm children and treat them as mere means for the benefit of others, and are inconsistent with how parents should treat their children and physicians should treat their patients.

Sheep generate important cardiovascular research models and the use of COLD has become more popular in experimental settings. METHODS Ultrasonic transit-time perivascular flow probes were surgically implanted on the pulmonary artery of 13 sheep. Paired COLD readings were taken at six time points, before and after implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and compared with COUFP recorded just after lithium injection. RESULTS The mean COLD was 5.7 litre min(-1) (range 3.8-9.6 litre min(-1)) and mean COUFP 5.9 litre min(-1) (range 4.0-9.2 litre min(-1)). The bias (standard deviation) was 0.3 (1.0) litre min(-1) [5.1 (16.9)%] and limits of agreement (LOA) were -1.7 to 2.3 litre min(-1) (-28.8 to 39.0%) with a percentage error (PE) of 34.4%. Data to assess trending [rate (95% confidence intervals)] included a 78 (62-93)% concordance rate in the four-quadrant plot (n=27). In the half moon polar plot (n=19), the mean polar angle was +5°, the radial LOA were -49 to +35° and 68 (47-89)% of data points fell within 22.5° of the mean polar angle. Both tests indicated moderate to poor trending ability. CONCLUSION COLD is not precise when evaluated against COUFP in sheep based on the statistical criteria set, but the results are comparable with previously published animal studies.","Axiak Flammer, S M; Critchley, L A; Weber, A; Pirbodaghi, T; Brinks, H; Vandenberghe, S",British journal of anaesthesia,256,6

The spread of fine droplets and particles can be understood, to leading order, by considering the movement of passive contaminants. A scaled (1:10) model of an isolation room (with water instead of air) was used to analyse the dilution of a passive contaminant (food dye), released either instantaneously or at a constant rate. The high level of turbulence, typical of isolation rooms, ensures that the dye concentration is uniform within the model room and mixing is perfect, and the measured mean concentration can be predicted theoretically. In a second series of experiments, the exchange generated by a door opening/closing is measured for different opening angles. A dipolar vortex is generated at the tip of the door which moves into the centre of the room, with a large coherent structure moving along the wall. The exchange volume is comparable to the swept volume of the door. Larger droplets and particles do not move passively. Their movement within a turbulent flow is studied by combining a Lagrangian model of particle movement with a kinematic simulation of a pseudo turbulent flow. The results show that while the mean fall velocity of particles is largely unchanged, turbulence significantly enhances horizontal and vertical dispersion. The horizontal spread as a function of the level of turbulence and droplet properties is estimated. The conclusions from both studies are brought together and discussed in the context of the airborne spread of contaminants within a general hospital room.","Eames, I; Shoaib, D; Klettner, C A; Taban, V","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",256,1

This study explores a potential side effect of a successful antivirus public health messaging campaign, when employees are back at work but the virus threat has not disappeared, that leads to on-the-job stress.

This study examines the relationship of pandemic public messaging sensitivity with tension and negative emotions on the job. Canonical correlation analysis is used with a sample of 1154 respondents, 4 predictor variables (reference group, self-regulation, media, and risk), and 2 criterion variables (negative emotions and job tension). Results show employees are differentially affected by the pandemic background noise.

METHODS We report the reorganization of the major hospital in Lombardy during COVID-19 pandemic, including the rearrangement of its ICU beds to face COVID-19 pandemic and fulfill its role as extended hub for time-dependent diseases while preserving transplant activity. To highlight the impact of the emergently planned hub-and-spoke system, all patients admitted to a COVID-19-free ICU hub for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke during the two-month period were retrospectively collected and compared to 2019 cohort. Regional data on organ procurement was retrieved. Observed-to-expected (OE) in-ICU mortality ratios were computed to test the impact of the pandemic on patients affected by time-dependent diseases. RESULTS Dynamic changes in ICU resource allocation occurred according to local COVID-19 epidemiology/trends of patients referred for time-dependent diseases. The absolute increase of admissions for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke was roughly two-fold. Patients referred to the hub were older and characterized by more severe conditions. An increase in crude mortality was observed, though OE ratios for in-ICU mortality were not statistically different when comparing 2020 vs. 2019. An increase in local organ procurement was observed, limiting the debacle of regional transplant activity.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are common during surgery and there is evidence of wide variability in practice. METHODS Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL), guideline clearinghouses and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to January 2019 for CPGs pertaining to indications for intraoperative RBC transfusion. Eligible guidelines were retrieved and their quality assessed using AGREE II. Relevant recommendations were abstracted and synthesized to allow for a comparison between guidelines. RESULTS Ten guidelines published between 1992 and 2018 provided indications for intraoperative transfusions. No guideline addressed intraoperative transfusion decision-making as its primary focus. Six guidelines provided criteria for transfusion based on hemoglobin (range 6.0-10.0 g/dL) or hematocrit (<30%) triggers. In the absence of objective transfusion rules, CPGs recommended considering other parameters such as blood loss (n = 7), signs of end organ ischemia (n = 5), and hemodynamics (n = 4). Evidence supporting intraoperative recommendations was extrapolated primarily from the non-operative setting. There was wide variability in the quality of included guidelines based on AGREE II scores. CONCLUSION This review has identified several clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations for intraoperative transfusion. The existing guidelines were noted to be highly variable in their recommendations and to lack a sufficient evidence base from the intraoperative setting. This represents a major knowledge gap in the literature.","Baker, Laura; Park, Lily; Gilbert, Richard; Ahn, Hilalion; Martel, Andre; Lenet, Tori; Davis, Alexandra; McIsaac, Daniel I; Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A; Martel, Guillaume",Annals of surgery,256,24

Infant homicides occurring within the first 24 hours of life (i.e., neonaticide) are primarily perpetrated by the mother, who might be of young age, unmarried, have lower educational attainment, and is most likely associated with concealment of an unintended pregnancy and nonhospital birthing (2). After the first day of life, infant homicides might be associated with other factors (e.g., child abuse and neglect or caregiver frustration) (2). A 2002 study of the age variation in homicide risk in U.S. infants during 1989-1998 found that the overall infant homicide rate was 8.3 per 100,000 person-years, and on the first day of life was 222.2 per 100,000 person-years, a homicide rate at least 10 times greater than that for any other time of life (3). Because of this period of heightened risk, by 2008 all 50 states* and Puerto Rico had enacted Safe Haven Laws. These laws allow a parent† to legally surrender an infant who might otherwise be abandoned or endangered (4). CDC analyzed infant homicides in the United States during 2008-2017 to determine whether rates changed after nationwide implementation of Safe Haven Laws, and to examine the association between infant homicide rates and state-specific Safe Haven age limits. During 2008-2017, the overall infant homicide rate was 7.2 per 100,000 person-years, and on the first day of life was 74.0 per 100,000 person-years, representing a 66.7% decrease from 1989-1998. However, the homicide rate on first day of life was still 5.4 times higher than that for any other time in life. No obvious association was found between infant homicide rates and Safe Haven age limits. States are encouraged to evaluate the effectiveness of their Safe Haven Laws and other prevention strategies to ensure they are achieving the intended benefits of preventing infant homicides. Programs and policies that strengthen economic supports, provide affordable childcare, and enhance and improve skills for young parents might contribute to the prevention of infant homicides.","Wilson, Rebecca F; Klevens, Joanne; Williams, Dionne; Xu, Likang",MMWR.

This illustrates an association of VIP-D with BRAF V600E mutations and demonstrates a therapeutic strategy in the specific context of VIP-D and BRAF V600E mutations in HR-NB patients. The addition of BRAF and MEK inhibitors allows continued conventional tumor-directed treatment by decreasing the severity of symptoms caused by this life-threatening complication.","Shahid, Sanam; Kushner, Brian H; Modak, Shakeel; Basu, Ellen M; Rubin, Elyssa M; Gundem, Gunes; Papaemmanuil, Elli; Roberts, Stephen S",Pediatric blood & cancer,256,16

These complaints have historically been attributed to olfactory dysfunction; however, there is evidence of direct, objective, gustatory disturbances in the setting of CRS that are not thoroughly characterized. This study sought to investigate and summarize gustatory dysfunction experienced by patients with CRS. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. English language, original studies investigating objective taste in adult patients with CRS were included. A meta-analysis with inverse variance, random-effects model was performed. RESULTS Of 2750 studies screened, 11 articles with 471 unique patients were included. Patients with CRS exhibit worse gustatory function compared to healthy controls (standardized mean difference 0.94 [95% CI, 0.44-1.45]). Hypogeusia was identified in 32/95 (33.7%) patients from three studies that used methods with a validated definition of hypogeusia. Older age, male gender, and smoking history were associated with taste dysfunction, while objective gustatory and olfactory dysfunction were not correlated. Subjective taste and quality of life measures were also not associated with objective taste. The impact of sinus surgery on objective taste is unclear. CONCLUSION Approximately 34% of patients with CRS experience hypogeusia. Neither olfactory function nor subjective taste were associated with objective gustatory function. Given the substantial prevalence of taste dysfunction patients with CRS, there is significant potential for growth in understanding of pathogenesis, impact on quality of life, and potential treatment strategies of taste impairment in the CRS patient population.

The aim of this study was to compare stent-assisted coiling and the balloon remodeling technique in terms of efficacy, stability, and safety for the treatment of comparable unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS 268 patients with 286 saccular unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated at our institution with stent- or balloon-assisted coiling and retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed to assess significant differences between the two groups. RESULTS The rate of complete occlusion at the end of the procedure was higher with stent-assisted coiling than with balloon-assisted coiling (86.8% vs 78%) and the same results were also observed after 6 months (92.1% vs 77.6%; p=0.05). About 50% of major recurrences occurred in large to giant aneurysms (p<0.001). The overall complication rate was similar in the stent-assisted and balloon-assisted groups (10.3% vs 9.3%). Independently of the technique, a higher complication rate was observed with bifurcational aneurysms, particularly in the middle cerebral artery (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted coiling achieved better results in terms of complete occlusion and stability than balloon-assisted coiling with a lower rate of recurrence without being associated with a higher risk of intraprocedural complications. Bifurcational and large to giant aneurysms were associated with higher complication rates and higher recurrence rates, respectively, and still represent a challenge for both techniques.","Consoli, Arturo; Vignoli, Chiara; Renieri, Leonardo; Rosi, Andrea; Chiarotti, Ivano; Nappini, Sergio; Limbucci, Nicola; Mangiafico, Salvatore",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,256,5

Given the developmentally sensitive periods of early childhood and adolescence, adolescent motherhood in conflict-affected contexts may put a family at risk intergenerationally. We propose that the specifics of normative neuroendocrine development during adolescence, including increased sensitivity to stress, pose additional risks to adolescent girls and their young children in the face of war and displacement, with potential lifelong consequences for health and development. This paper proposes a developmental, dual-generational framework for research and policies to better understand and address the needs of adolescent mothers and their small children. We draw from the literature on developmental stress physiology, adolescent parenthood in contexts of war and displacement internationally, and developmental cultural neurobiology. We also identify culturally meaningful sources of resilience and provide a review of the existing literature on interventions supporting adolescent mothers and their offspring.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using hemostatic energy-based surgical devices during thyroid surgery in a canine model. METHODS Twenty-four beagle dogs were randomly divided into the following groups: electrotome (30 kW), electrotome (15 kW), the Harmonic scalpel (output level 3), and LigaSure (middle gear). The hemostatic devices were applied on the thyroid surface for 3 seconds and then near the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; distance of 5 mm, 3 mm, or 1 mm) for 3 seconds. Evoked electromyography (EMG) amplitudes were recorded by intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). Acute microstructural morphological damage to thyroid tissues and the RLN were evaluated immediately after the procedure by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS Electrotome caused a significant decrease in evoked EMG amplitudes when applied at a vertical distance of 1 mm from the RLN, both at 30 kW (1046 ± 404.3 μV vs 153 ± 245.5 μV; p < .001) and 15 kW (1197 ± 589.2 μV vs 986.3 ± 797.3 μV; p = .037), compared with those evoked under normal conditions. Furthermore, distinct acute microstructural morphological changes of the RLNs were observed by light and electron microscopy. However, no significant functional or histological changes were induced by the electrotome at a vertical distance of 5 mm or 3 mm from the RLN. The Harmonic scalpel and LigaSure induced neither marked changes in evoked EMG amplitudes when applied at vertical distances of 5 mm, 3 mm, or 1 mm (all p > .05) nor microstructural morphological changes in the RLNs. The electrotome (15 kW) caused more serious thermal damage to thyroid tissues than that caused by either the Harmonic scalpel or LigaSure (thermal damaged depth: 0.951 ± 0.061 vs 0.756 ± 0.074, p < .001; 0.951 ± 0.061 vs 0.724 ± 0.116, p < .001). Nevertheless, there were no differences between the Harmonic scalpel and LigaSure groups (p = .435). CONCLUSION LigaSure and the Harmonic scalpel might be safer than electrotome when used in thyroid operations. LigaSure generates less heat than the Harmonic scalpel and electrotome. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Endovascular treatment of ACoA aneurysms has provided good results, but until the introduction of intracranial stents, many ACoA aneurysms could not be treated without craniotomy. The current study analyzes the results of ACoA aneurysm treatment using stent assisted embolization. METHODS 64 patients with ACoA aneurysms underwent stent assisted aneurysm repair. Four were treated in the acute rupture phase and a fifth ruptured aneurysm was stented in a second procedure after initial coiling. Five aneurysms were 10 mm or more in greatest diameter. Follow-up angiography was performed 6 months after treatment; then, patients were followed with annual MR angiography. Technical, clinical, and long term radiographic results were analyzed. RESULTS Stents were successfully deployed in each case. One patient was eventually treated with a three stent construct and died of perioperative hemorrhage. One major stroke occurred during a separate procedure when a patient was taken off antiplatelet medications. These cases were the only aneurysm related morbidity (1.6%) and mortality (1.6%) events during the entire follow-up period. After stent assisted embolization, 32 (50.0%) ACoA aneurysms were completely occluded, 15 (23.4%) had residual neck, and 17 (26.6%) had residual filling. At first radiographic follow-up, 39 of 55 (70.9%) showed complete occlusion. Three (5.5%) total aneurysms required retreatment. CONCLUSIONS Stent assisted aneurysm treatment was a safe and effective option in this series of ACoA aneurysms with maximum diameter less than 15 mm. ACoA aneurysms may be more likely to recur regardless of treatment option, but stent assisted embolization may be durable after stable initial radiographic follow-up.","Johnson, Andrew Kelly; Munich, Stephan A; Heiferman, Daniel M; Lopes, Demetrius Klee",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,256,14

Because of high densities of somatostatin receptors (sstr)--mainly sstr-2--on the cell surface of these tumors, (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide scintigraphy has become an important part of clinical management. (18)F-radiolabeled analogs with suitable pharmacokinetics would permit PET with more rapid clinical protocols. METHODS We compared the affinity in vitro and tissue pharmacokinetics by PET of 5 structurally related (19)F/(18)F-fluoroethyltriazole-Tyr(3)-octreotate (FET-TOCA) analogs: FET-G-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-TOCA, FETE-PEG-TOCA, FET-G-TOCA, FETE-TOCA, and FET-βAG-TOCA to the recently described (18)F-aluminum fluoride NOTA-octreotide ((18)F-AIF-NOTA-OC) and the clinical radiotracer (68)Ga-DOTATATE. RESULTS All (19)F-fluoroethyltriazole-Tyr(3)-octreotate compounds retained high agonist binding affinity to sstr-2 in vitro (half-maximal effective concentration, 4-19 nM vs. somatostatin at 5.6 nM). Dynamic PET showed that incorporation of PEG linkers, exemplified by (18)F-FET-G-PEG-TOCA and (18)F-FETE-PEG-TOCA, reduced uptake in high sstr-2-expressing AR42J pancreatic cancer xenografts. (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA showed the lowest nonspecific uptake in the liver. Tumor uptake increased in the order (68)Ga-DOTATATE < (18)F-AIF-NOTA ≤ (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA < (18)F-FET-G-TOCA. The uptake of (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA was specific: a radiolabeled scrambled peptide, (18)F-FET-βAG-[W-c-(CTFTYC)K], did not show tumor uptake; there was lower uptake of (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA in AR42J xenografts when mice were pretreated with 10 mg of unlabeled octreotide per kilogram; and there was low uptake of (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA in low sstr-2-expressing HCT116 xenografts. CONCLUSION We have developed novel fluoroethyltriazole-Tyr(3)-octreotate radioligands that combine high specific binding with rapid target localization and rapid pharmacokinetics for high-contrast PET. (18)F-FET-βAG-TOCA and (18)F-FET-G-TOCA are candidates for future clinical evaluation.","Leyton, Julius; Iddon, Lisa; Perumal, Meg; Indrevoll, Bard; Glaser, Matthias; Robins, Edward; George, Andrew J T; Cuthbertson, Alan; Luthra, Sajinder K; Aboagye, Eric O","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",256,32

Using quantum dots (QDs) in the absorber region of the SESAMs instead of quantum wells, enables additional degrees of freedom in the design, the control of saturation parameters and the recovery dynamics. However, if one wants to integrate such a SESAM element into semiconductor surface emitting lasers such as a mode-locked integrated external-cavity surface-emitting laser (MIXSEL), the saturable absorber layers have to withstand a longer high-temperature growth procedure for the epitaxial formation of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). Typically defect related SESAMs will be annealed at those growth temperatures and lose their high-speed performance. Here we present a systematic study on the growth parameters and post-growth annealing of SESAMs based on high-quality InxGa1-xAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by MBE at growth temperatures of 450 °C or higher. The good quality enables the QDs to survive the long DBR overgrowth at 600 °C with only minimal shifts in the designed operation wavelength of 1030 nm required for growth of MIXSEL devices. The introduction of recombination centers with p-type modulation doping and additional post-growth annealing improves the absorption of the high-quality QDs. Hence, low saturation fluences < 10 µJ/cm2 and a reduction of the τ1/e recovery time to values < 2 ps can be achieved.","Finke, T; Nürnberg, J; Sichkovskyi, V; Golling, M; Keller, U; Reithmaier, J P",Optics express,256,13

We describe clinical pictures, risk factors for death and chances to recovery in a large cohort of KT recipients with COVID-19. METHODS Inclusion in a Spanish prospectively filled registry was allowed for KT cases with confirmed COVID-19. Outcomes were assessed as in-hospital mortality or recovery. RESULTS The study population comprised 414 patients. Fever, respiratory symptoms and dyspnea were the most frequent COVID-19 related symptoms, and 81.4% of them had pneumonia. More than one-third of patients showed digestive symptoms at diagnosis, combinations of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Most patients were hospitalized, 12.1% in intensive-care units, and 17.6% needed ventilator support. Treatment for COVID-19 included frequently hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, high dose steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir and tocilizumab. After a mean follow-up of 44 days, the fatality rate was 26.3%. Pneumonia without gastrointestinal symptoms was associated with a 36.3% mortality (Respiratory phenotype), and gastrointestinal symptoms without pneumonia with a 5.3% mortality (Gastrointestinal phenotype). The mixed pneumonia and gastrointestinal phenotype showed an intermediate mortality of 19.5% (Mixed phenotype). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and pneumonia were independently associated with death, while the gastrointestinal phenotype was associated with recovery. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 is frequent among the KT population. Advanced age and pneumonia are the main clinical features associated with a high mortality rate. Gastrointestinal disease is associated with a more benign course and lower mortality.","Crespo, Marta; Mazuecos, Auxiliadora; Rodrigo, Emilio; Gavela, Eva; Villanego, Florentino; Sánchez-Alvarez, Emilio; González-Monte, Esther; Jiménez-Martín, Carlos; Melilli, Edoardo; Diekman, Fritz; Zárraga, Sofía; Hernández, Domingo; Pascual, Julio",Transplantation,256,1

METHODS Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were randomly separated into a control group (CON), ovalbumin (OVA) group, and an OVA + RSV group, (n=8 mice/group). At the end of experiments, we evaluated the RSV-infected asthma model using Wright-Giemsa staining, histopathology and immunoglobulin E (IgE) level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Next, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was measured using Buxco's modular and invasive system. Furthermore, IL cytokine expression were measured using ELISA. Moreover, feces were collected for 16S ribosome RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing and data analysis. RESULTS We observed that the total BAL fluid lung cells in the OVA + RSV group was significantly higher than other group. we revealed that the inflammatory infiltration, edema, and collagen hyperplasia were more severe in the OVA + RSV group. The AHR of RSV-infected mice was aggravated compared with the other groups, (P<0.05 and P<0.01). We observed a higher expression of IgE, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-25, and IL-33 levels in mice from the OVA and OVA + RSV groups (P<0.05 and P<0.01). The associations between Prevotellaceae_UCG_001, which is positive, and IgE, IL-13, IL-33 (P<0.001), IL-5 (P<0.01), and IL-25 (P<0.05) were highly significant. Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group is also positive and was significantly associated with IgE and IL-33. Helicobacter and Uncultured_Bacteroidales_bacteriumare_group, which are negative, were associated with IL-25 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our results indicated that RSV-infected mice with asthma may have changes in the gut microbiota's major components and may influence the mutual relationship between the core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and IgE as well as inflammatory cytokines.","Wang, Jing; Lu, Huina; Yu, Linlin; Cheng, Weiwei; Yan, Wuning; Jing, Xiaoping",Annals of palliative medicine,256,1

Subjective childbirth experience is influenced not only by characteristics of the childbirth itself but also by maternal characteristics. A maternal characteristic that may be associated with a more positive childbirth experience is trait mindfulness. The current study aimed to assess this association and to assess whether trait mindfulness during pregnancy had a moderating role in the possible association between non-spontaneous delivery and perception of childbirth. A subsample of 486 women, participating in a longitudinal prospective cohort study (Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the first Postpartum Year study), completed the Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form at 22 weeks of pregnancy. Women completed the Childbirth Perception Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale between 7 and 21 days postpartum. The mindfulness facets acting with awareness and non-reacting were significantly associated with a more positive perception of childbirth, after adjusting for covariates. Moderation analyses showed a significant interaction between acting with awareness and non-spontaneous delivery and non-judging and non-spontaneous delivery. Non-spontaneous delivery was associated with a more negative perception of childbirth for low/medium scores of acting with awareness and non-judging, but not for high scores on these mindfulness facets. Trait mindfulness during pregnancy may enhance a positive perception of childbirth. Because this is among the first studies examining the association between maternal dispositional mindfulness and perception of childbirth, future research is needed to confirm the results of the current study.","Hulsbosch, Lianne P; Boekhorst, Myrthe G B M; Potharst, Eva S; Pop, Victor J M; Nyklíček, Ivan",Archives of women's mental health,256,31

In this study, mercury contamination was investigated in brown booby (Sula leucogaster) adults and juveniles during their breeding season at the Santana Archipelago, on the southeast coast of Brazil. Two hypotheses were evaluated: 1. As females consume larger prey than males due to the reverse sexual dimorphism, higher total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations are expected in females tissues than in males; 2. Adult seabirds have more time to accumulate mercury than juveniles, so it is expected that adults will show higher THg and MeHg concentrations than juveniles in their feathers, but none in blood since the last indicates the exposure of short time (30-60 days), as it is a constantly synthesized tissue. Feathers and blood were sampled from 20 individuals of each group (males, females and juveniles). Also, 10 eggs of the brown booby and muscle tissue samples of their main prey were collected, from February to October 2018. Females and males had similar THg concentrations in the tissues with no statistical differences between sexes. Thus, the sexual size dimorphism did not influence mercury concentrations among the tissues and both genders can be used as a biomonitor. Brown booby juveniles had low THg and MeHg concentrations compared to adults due to a shorter time of exposure for mercury to bioaccumulate in their tissues. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, analyzing methylmercury in feathers, blood and eggs of a tropical seabird, which can be a useful baseline for future studies on the effects of contaminants on this species in tropical regions.","Bighetti, G P; Padilha, J A; Cunha, L S T; Kasper, D; Malm, O; Mancini, P L",Environmental pollution,256,6

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific parameter for infection and inflammation but might be employed as a trigger for diagnosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT can be used to detect inflammatory foci in neutropenic patients with elevated CRP and whether it helps to direct treatment. METHODS Twenty-eight consecutive patients with neutropenia as a result of intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancies or myeloablative therapy for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation were prospectively included. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was added to the regular diagnostic workup once the CRP level rose above 50 mg/l. RESULTS Pathological FDG uptake was found in 26 of 28 cases despite peripheral neutrophil counts less than 0.1 × 10(-9)/l in 26 patients: in the digestive tract in 18 cases, around the tract of the central venous catheter (CVC) in 9 and in the lungs in 7 cases. FDG uptake in the CVC tract was associated with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia (p < 0.001) and deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.002). The number of patients having Streptococcus mitis bacteraemia appeared to be higher in patients with grade 3 oesophageal FDG uptake (p = 0.08). Pulmonary FDG uptake was associated with the presence of invasive fungal disease (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION (18)F-FDG PET/CT scanning during chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and increased CRP is able to detect localized foci of infection and inflammation despite the absence of circulating neutrophils. Besides its potential role in detecting CVC-related infection during febrile neutropenia, the high negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT is important for avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapy.","Vos, Fidel J; Donnelly, J Peter; Oyen, Wim J G; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Blijlevens, Nicole M A",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,256,16

All adult oncology patients referred to the cardio-oncology service at the Cleveland Clinic from January 2011 up to June 2018 were included in the study. Comprehensive clinical information were collected. The impact on survival of temporal trends of cardiovascular disease in oncology patients were assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model and time-varying covariate adjustment for confounders. In total, 6,754 patients were included in the study (median age, 57 years; [interquartile range, 47-65 years]; 3,898 women [58%]; oncology history [60% - breast cancer, lymphoma and leukemia]). Mortality and diagnosis of clinical cardiac disease peaked around the time of chemotherapy. 2,293 patients (34%) were diagnosed with a new cardiovascular risk factor after chemotherapy, over half of which were identified in the first year after cancer diagnosis. Patients with pre-existing and post-chemotherapy cardiovascular disease had significantly worse outcomes than patients that did not develop any cardiovascular disease (p<0.0001). The highest one-year hazard ratios [HR] of post-chemotherapy cardiovascular disease were significantly associated with male [HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.55-2.11; p<0.001] and diabetes [HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.26-1.81; p<0.001]. In conclusion, patients referred to cardio-oncology, first diagnosis of cardiac events peaked around the time of chemotherapy. Those with pre-existing or post-chemotherapy cardiovascular disease had worse survival. In addition to a high rate of cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, risk factor profile worsened over course of follow-up.","Hussain, Muzna; Hou, Yuan; Watson, Chris; Moudgil, Rohit; Shah, Chirag; Abraham, Jame; Budd, G Thomas; Tang, W H Wilson; Finet, J Emanuel; James, Karen; Estep, Jerry D; Xu, Bo; Hu, Bo; Cremer, Paul; Jellis, Christine; Grimm, Richard A; Greenberg, Neil; Popovic, Zoran B; Cho, Leslie; Desai, Milind Y; Nissen, Steven E; Kapadia, Samir R; Svensson, Lars G; Griffin, Brian P; Cheng, Feixiong; Collier, Patrick",The American journal of cardiology,256,1

METHODS Seventy-two patients were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the upper central incisors having color A2 or darker according to the Vita Classical scale (VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) and randomized into two groups: 10% hydrogen peroxide applied once daily for 15 minutes (HP 15) or applied once daily for 30 minutes (HP 30). Bleaching was performed for 14 days in both groups. The color was evaluated before bleaching, during bleaching (1st and 2nd weeks), and 1 month after the bleaching treatment using the Vita Classical, Vita Bleachedguide 3D-MASTER, and Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer (VITA Zahnfabrik). Dental sensitivity was recorded by the patients using the numerical rating scale (0-4) and visual analogue scale (0-10 cm). Color data were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures (group vs. treatment time). The Mann-Whitney test was performed to contrast the means (α=0.05). Tooth sensitivity was assessed by Fisher's exact test (p=1.00) and intensity of tooth sensitivity was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test (α=0.05) for both scales. RESULTS A significant whitening effect was observed after 2 weeks of bleaching for all color measurements (p=0.01), with no difference between HP 15 and HP 30 (p>0.05). Also, the absolute risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity were similar (47%; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness and tooth sensitivity of at-home bleaching carried out with 10% hydrogen peroxide applied for 15 minutes or 30 minutes are similar.","Chemin, K; Rezende, M; Costa, M C; Salgado, Ady; de Geus, J L; Loguercio, A D; Reis, A; Kossatz, S",Operative dentistry,256,5

One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface (A/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon-β and interferon-λ (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.","Qian, Zhaohui; Travanty, Emily A; Oko, Lauren; Edeen, Karen; Berglund, Andrew; Wang, Jieru; Ito, Yoko; Holmes, Kathryn V; Mason, Robert J",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,256,1

Because of TCS inhibition effect on vast majority of bacterial species, it is important to explore fungal species and their involved enzymes in TCS biodegradation. The aim of this study was to compare the potential of two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor for TCS biodegradation through the whole cell culture of fungi in an aqueous culture medium. Additionally, the changes in ligninolytic enzyme activities and possible correlations and contributions of degradative enzymes during TCS biodegradation process were monitored. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was carried out using a factorial experiment with a completely randomized design in three replications. factorial design in The experimental factors included: two white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor and uninoculated controls which were subjected to five levels of TCS concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 μg mL-1) to assess ligninolytic enzymatic activity during biodegradation of TCS. Samples were harvested periodically at three time intervals (4, 7 and 10 days). An AB SCIEX 3200 QTRAP LC-MS/MS system was used in order to analyze the biodegradation of TCS in liquid medium. RESULTS Results suggested that the two white rot fungi responded differently when exposed to the different concentrations of TCS. In general, P. ostreatus exhibited more potential and ligninolytic enzymatic activity compared to T. versicolor. LC-MS/MS analyses also showed that P. ostreatus degraded TCS with higher efficiency compared to T. versicolor. In addition, almost all P. ostreatus biodegradation activity was completed within the first day of sampling. Contrasting, less efficient degradation was observed by T. versicolor, reaching around 88% of TCS biodegradation at concentration of 20 μg mL-1after 10 days. At higher TCS concentrations (≥30 μg mL-1), the growth of T. versicolor severely inhibited and led to a drop in enzymatic activity and biodegradation. Furthermore, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were determined as more involved enzymes which significantly correlated to TCS biodegradation by T. versicolor and P. ostreatus, respectively. CONCLUSION P. ostreatus might be considered as efficient fungus in biodegradation of high amount of TCS in environmental matrices. The results of the present study might provide insights for future investigations on potential of fungi for applications in bioaugmentation-based strategies to remove TCS from wastewater and activated sludge.","Mallak, Ayda Maadani; Lakzian, Amir; Khodaverdi, Elham; Haghnia, Gholam Hossein; Mahmoudi, Shima",Microbial pathogenesis,256,16

This procedure can be challenging, and we lack factors predicting the operative difficulty. AIMS To assess the role of surgeon experience and identify possible predictive factors of intraoperative difficulties. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-one selected patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2008 and August 2010. Six surgeons were involved (3 seniors, 3 juniors). Anthropometrics of the patients, types of ports, exposure methods and intraoperative data were recorded. Pain was assessed with the visual analogic scale at postoperative day 1 (POD 1 VAS). RESULTS Fifty-eight patients with symptomatic gallstones and three with acute cholecystitis underwent single port cholecystectomy. The mean BMI, weight and height were 25.7 kg/m(2) (SD 4.45), 71.8 kg (SD 14.83) and 166 cm SD 0.07, respectively. Mean operative time was 68.4 min (SD 26.98). Anthropometrics had no influence on operative time. Senior surgeons performed more rapidly, but the difference was not significant. The overall mean POD 1 VAS was 2.26, (SD 1.81). The mean hospital stay was 2.22 days, (SD 0.9). No complications occurred. An additional exposure method was necessary in 19 procedures. This cluster presented a significantly higher operating time (81.5 min, SD 31.69 vs. 62.7, SD 22.74; p = 0.01) and POD 1 VAS (1.92 vs. 3; p = 0.031). CONCLUSION Single trocar cholecystectomy can be implemented safely in teaching hospitals. Anthropometrics are not predictive of operative difficulties. The need for additional exposure systems affects the operative time and pain negatively, reflecting greater technical difficulties. Research to optimize instruments may help to solve these problems.","Mutter, D; Callari, C; Diana, M; Dallemagne, B; Leroy, J; Marescaux, J",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,256,1

In the second part of this study, we characterized MBL2 genotype polymorphisms in pediatric-onset SLE patients and their possible associations with HZ. METHODS This 10-year prospective cohort study compared pediatric-onset SLE patients from Taiwan with and without histories of HZ. By using 2 years as a standard interval, patients with early-onset and late-onset of HZ were compared. MBL2 gene polymorphisms in exon 1 at codon 54, and in the promoter at the position -221 and -550, were tested immediately after patient enrollment. RESULTS We initially enrolled 98 SLE patients, and analyzed complete clinical characteristics of 82 patients (35 patients with HZ, 47 patients without HZ). The incidence of HZ was higher in SLE patients who had methylprednisolone pulse therapy, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, and received higher cumulative steroid dose (P < 0.05 for all 3). There were no significant associations of HZ with MBL2 genotype or serum level of mannose-binding lectin. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric-onset SLE patients were highly susceptible to HZ, with an incidence of 35.7%. Patients given steroid, cyclophosphamide, and high cumulative steroid dose were more likely to have had HZ. Deficiency of serum mannose-binding lectin and MBL2 gene polymorphism were not associated with HZ.","Wu, Shun-An; Yeh, Kou-Wei; Yao, Tsung-Chieh; Huang, Jing-Long",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,256,16

In this study, statistical analyses of the literature were performed to clarify the application and research status of PCT in respiratory diseases. Future research directions are discussed. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC). Published literature between 1995 and February 6, 2021 were searched using the following strategies: subject term = procalcitonin; and Web of Science categories = Respiratory System. Using the Citespace software, the literature on the application of PCT in patients with respiratory diseases was analyzed in terms of annual publication status, subject distribution, country/institution distribution, journal distribution, author distribution, and keywords. RESULTS A total of 542 related research literatures were identified, with the number of published papers and the number of literature citations increasing yearly. Research was mainly concentrated in the United States, China, Switzerland, and other countries, with countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada being involved in international collaborations. Research institutions were mainly universities or hospitals such as the University Hospital of Basel, University of Barcelona, and Northwestern University. In particular, the University Hospital of Basel had extensive inter-hospital collaborations. Stolz et al. published many related papers, but the centrality value was low. Authors including Christ-Crain M, Schuetz P, and Stolz D were highly cited. Journals such as the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chest, and the European Respiratory Journal were more influential.

While in some circumstances anticholinergic effects are therapeutic, they also pose many undesired or adverse effects. The overall impact from concomitant use of multiple medications with anticholinergic properties is termed anticholinergic burden (ACB). Greater ACB is associated with increased risks of impaired physical and cognitive function, falls, cardiovascular events, and mortality. This has led to the development of interventions aimed at reducing ACB through the deprescribing of anticholinergic drugs. However, little is known about the implementation issues that may influence successful embedding and integration of such interventions into routine clinical practice. In this paper, we present the protocol for our systematic review that aims to identify the qualitative evidence for the barriers and facilitators to reduce ACB from the perspectives of patients, carers, and healthcare professionals.

We provide an updated analysis on the financial impact of pediatric fellowship training and model interventions that can influence the results. METHODS We estimated the financial returns a graduating pediatric resident might anticipate from fellowship training followed by a career as a pediatric subspecialist and compared them with the returns expected from starting a career as a general pediatrician immediately after residency. We evaluated the potential effects of eliminating medical school debt, shortening the length of fellowship training, and implementing a federal loan repayment program for pediatric subspecialists. We compared the financial returns of subspecialty training in 2018-2019 to those from our previous report. RESULTS Pursuing fellowship training generated widely variable financial returns when compared with general pediatrics that ranged from +$852 129 for cardiology to -$1 594 366 for adolescent medicine. Twelve of 15 subspecialties analyzed yielded negative financial returns. The differences have become more pronounced over time: the spread between the highest and lowest earning subspecialties widened from >$1.4 million in 2007-2008 to >$2.3 million in 2018-2019. The negative financial impact of fellowship training could be partially ameliorated by shortening the length of training or by implementing pediatric subspecialist specific loan repayment programs.

In an event-related fMRI experiment, we implemented a novel form of sham acupuncture, phantom acupuncture, that reproduces the acupuncture needling procedure without somatosensory tactile stimulation while maintaining the credibility of the acupuncture treatment context. Fifty-six non-specific low back pain patients received either real (REAL) or phantom (PHNT) acupuncture stimulation in a parallel group study. The REAL group exhibited greater activation in the posterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting the needling-specific components of acupuncture. We demonstrated that PHNT could be delivered credibly. Interestingly, the PHNT-credible group exhibited bilateral activation in SI/SII and also reported vicarious acupuncture sensations without needling stimulation. The PHNT group showed greater activation in the bilateral dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC/vlPFC). Moreover, the PHNT group exhibited significant pain reduction, with a significant correlation between the subjective fMRI signal in the right dlPFC/vlPFC and a score assessing belief in acupuncture effectiveness. These results support an expectation-related placebo analgesic effect on subjective pain intensity ratings, possibly mediated by right prefrontal cortex activity.","Makary, Meena M; Lee, Jeungchan; Lee, Eunyoung; Eun, Seulgi; Kim, Jieun; Jahng, Geon-Ho; Kim, Kiok; Youn, You-Suk; Lee, Jun-Hwan; Park, Kyungmo",Scientific reports,256,1

Recently clinical trials have been initiated offering non-surgical treatment to these women, but not all may agree to participate in such trials. This paper aims to describe the patient characteristics, and surgical outcomes of women with suspected early stage endometrial cancer and body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, who declined enrolment in the feMMe trial, which offers non-surgical hormonal treatment, hormonal plus metformin or hormonal plus weight loss as primary treatment. METHODS Consecutive case series from a tertiary gynaecological oncology unit. Over the course of the first 2 years of the feMMe trial, 27 patients met the initial eligibility screening, but declined enrolment in the feMMe trial and opted for upfront surgery. The main surgical outcome measures were type of surgical approach, need for conversion from laparoscopic to open approach, length of stay in hospital and adverse events. RESULTS Patients' median age was 63 years (range 40 to 86); median BMI was 37.3 kg/m2 (range 30.7 to 54.7); median medical co-morbidities were six (range 3-10). Of the 26/27 surgeries planned to be undertaken laparoscopically, 2/26 patients had to be converted (7 %). Overall, the average hospital stay was 4.5 days, and 11/27 (41 %) of the patients developed one or more adverse events grade 2+ rated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.

Our systematic review protocol is pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018117367). An electronic search was made in PsycINFO, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Embase, and Pubmed of all literature published until August 2018. Of the 1,217 studies found from the search, a total 39 placebo-controlled studies that met the eligibility criteria were synthesized for the present study. Due to substantial heterogeneity of study designs, populations, cannabinoid compounds, and quantitative sensory testing outcomes, meta-analysis was not conducted. More consistent evidence of cannabinoid analgesia was observed for inhaled cannabis than synthetic cannabinoids. Analgesic effects were most commonly observed in tests of cold pain sensitivity, and hyperalgesic effects were most commonly observed in tests of electrical stimulation. Patterns of findings from studies with healthy subjects did not substantively differ from those with CNCP. However, these observations are qualified by the high degree of inconsistency across studies and methodological heterogeneity. We offer recommendations for future studies to improve study rigor and reproducibility.","Mun, Chung Jung; Letzen, Janelle E; Peters, Erica N; Campbell, Claudia M; Vandrey, Ryan; Gajewski-Nemes, Julia; DiRenzo, Dana; Caufield-Noll, Christine; Finan, Patrick H",Pain,256,4

The Japan Triage and Acuity Scale (JTAS) is frequently used for emergency patients, and the ESI has not been evaluated against the JTAS in Japan. This study aimed to examine the decision accuracy of the ESI for simulated clinical scenarios among nursing specialists in Japan compared with the JTAS. METHOD A parallel group randomized trial was conducted. In total, 23 JTAS-trained triage nurses from 10 Japanese emergency departments were randomly assigned to the ESI or the JTAS group. Nurses independently assigned triage categories to 80 emergency cases for the assessment of interrater agreement. RESULTS Interrater agreement between the expert and triage nurses was κ = 0.82 (excellent) in the ESI group and κ = 0.74 (substantial) in the JTAS group. In addition, interrater agreement by acuity was level 2 = 0.42 (moderate) in the ESI group and level 2 = 0.31 (fair) in the JTAS group. Interrater agreement for triage decisions was classified in a higher category in the ESI group than in the JTAS Scale group at level 2. Triage decisions based on the ESI in Japan maintained the same level of interrater agreement and sensitivity as those in other countries. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the ESI can be introduced in Japan, despite its different emergency medical background compared with other countries.","Takaoka, Koichi; Ooya, Kensuke; Ono, Masaya; Kakeda, Takahiro",Journal of emergency nursing,256,1

DESIGN A retrospective analysis of medical records was performed. BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia is a frequent complication of enterostomata. Fascial repair using a prosthetic mesh has been generally accepted as the best method of parastomal hernia repair. New studies suggest the use of a prophylactic mesh placement at the initial operation, but fear of wound infection and mesh removal is still high. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of patient records was performed of all patients with extra-peritoneal parastomal hernia repair using a prosthetic mesh between 1997 and 2006. The patient demographic data, enterostomy indication, therapy, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS In the 10-year study period, 16 parastomal hernia repairs using an extra-peritoneal prosthetic mesh in the onlay position were performed. In one patient, a mesh infection occurred, resulting in mesh removal (6.2%). The recurrence rate was 19% after a mean follow-up of 33 months. CONCLUSION Parastomal hernia repair using a prosthetic mesh is a safe and effective method, with the lowest recurrence rates and acceptably low infection rates. Prosthetic materials should not be used in cases of fecal contamination.","Lüning, T H; Spillenaar-Bilgen, E-J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,256,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five publicly available databases comprising normal CXR, confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases, and other pneumonias were used. After the harmonization of the data, the training set included 7966 normal cases, 5451 with other pneumonia, and 258 CXRs with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas in the testing data set, each category was represented by 100 cases. Eleven blinded radiologists with various levels of expertise independently read the testing data set. The data were analyzed separately with the newly proposed artificial intelligence-based system and by consultant radiologists and residents, with respect to positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and F-score (harmonic mean for PPV and sensitivity). The χ test was used to compare the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and F-scores of the readers and the system. RESULTS The proposed system achieved higher overall diagnostic accuracy (94.3%) than the radiologists (61.4% ± 5.3%). The radiologists reached average sensitivities for normal CXR, other type of pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia of 85.0% ± 12.8%, 60.1% ± 12.2%, and 53.2% ± 11.2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than the results achieved by the algorithm (98.0%, 88.0%, and 97.0%; P < 0.00032). The mean PPVs for all 11 radiologists for the 3 categories were 82.4%, 59.0%, and 59.0% for the healthy, other pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively, resulting in an F-score of 65.5% ± 12.4%, which was significantly lower than the F-score of the algorithm (94.3% ± 2.0%, P < 0.00001). When other pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases were pooled, the proposed system reached an accuracy of 95.7% for any pathology and the radiologists, 88.8%. The overall accuracy of consultants did not vary significantly compared with residents (65.0% ± 5.8% vs 67.4% ± 4.2%); however, consultants detected significantly more COVID-19 pneumonia cases (P = 0.008) and less healthy cases (P < 0.00001).

Additionally, while previous studies on evaluation of real and fake news have mostly focused on characteristics of the evaluator (i.e., analytical reasoning), characteristics of the news stimuli (i.e., news source credibility) and the interplay between the two have been largely ignored. To address these research gaps, this project examined the role of analytical reasoning and news source credibility on evaluation of real and fake full-length news story articles. The project considered both accuracy and perceived credibility ratings as outcome variables, thus qualifying previous work focused solely on news detection accuracy. METHOD We conducted two independent but parallel studies, with Study 2 as a direct replication of Study 1, employing the same design but in a larger sample (Study 1: N = 292 vs. Study 2: N = 357). In both studies, participants viewed 12 full-length news articles (6 real, 6 fake), followed by prompts to evaluate each article's veracity and credibility. Participants were randomly assigned to view articles with a credible or non-credible source and completed the Cognitive Reflection Test as well as short demographic questions. FINDINGS Consistent across both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with greater fake news accuracy, while analytical reasoning was not associated with real news accuracy. In addition, in both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with lower perceived credibility for fake news, while analytical reasoning was not associated with perceived credibility for real news. Furthermore, lower analytical reasoning was associated with greater accuracy for real (but not fake) news from credible compared to non-credible sources, with this effect only detected in Study 2. CONCLUSIONS The novel results generated in this research are discussed in light of classical vs. naturalistic accounts of decision-making as well as cognitive processes underlying news articles evaluation. The results extend previous findings that analytical reasoning contributes to fake news detection to full-length news articles. Furthermore, news-related cues such as the credibility of the news source systematically affected discrimination ability between real and fake news.","Pehlivanoglu, Didem; Lin, Tian; Deceus, Farha; Heemskerk, Amber; Ebner, Natalie C; Cahill, Brian S",Cognitive research: principles and implications,256,1

However, it has become clear that the receptor is versatile, widely expressed and plays an indispensable role in both immunological and non-immunological processes throughout life. The receptor rescues immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin from intracellular degradation and shuttles the ligands across polarized cell barriers, in all cases via a pH dependent binding-and-release mechanism. These processes secure distribution and high levels of both IgG and albumin throughout the body. At mucosal sites, FcRn transports IgG across polarized epithelial cells where it retrieves IgG in complex with luminal antigens that is delivered to tissue-localized immune cells. In dendritic cells (DCs), FcRn orchestrates processing of IgG-opsonized immune complexes (ICs) in concert with classical Fcγ receptors, which results in antigen presentation and cross-presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC class II and I to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Hence, FcRn regulates transport of the ligands within and across different types of cells, but also processing of IgG-ICs by immune cells. As such, the receptor is involved in immune surveillance and protection against infections. In this brief review, we highlight how FcRn expressed by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells contributes to immune regulation at mucosal barriers - biology that can be utilized in development of biologics and subunit vaccines for non-invasive delivery.","Aaen, Kristin Hovden; Anthi, Aina Karen; Sandlie, Inger; Nilsen, Jeannette; Mester, Simone; Andersen, Jan Terje",Scandinavian journal of immunology,256,1

The method is based on a microwave-assisted solid-liquid extraction approach (MA-SLE), using an aqueous solution of an ionic liquid (IL)-based surfactant as extraction phase. The method does not require organic solvents, nor any clean-up step, apart from filtration prior to the injection in the analytical system. Two IL-based surfactants were evaluated, and the method was optimized by using experimental designs, resulting in the use of small amounts of sample (100 mg) and extraction phase (2.25 mL), low concentrations of the selected 1-hexadecyl-3-butyl imidazolium bromide IL (0.1 mM), and 30 min of extraction time. The proposed methodology was applied for the determination of the polyphenolic pattern of six different varieties of Vitis vinifera leaves from the Canary Islands, using high-performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array detection for the quantification of the compounds. The proposed MA-SLE approach was greener, simpler, and more effective than other methods, while the results from the analysis of the leaves samples demonstrate that these by-products can be exploited as a source of natural compounds for many applications.","Mastellone, Giulia; Pacheco-Fernández, Idaira; Rubiolo, Patrizia; Pino, Verónica; Cagliero, Cecilia",Molecules,256,1

Yet, what determines physical distancing? Through a panel data analysis, this article identifies some of its determinants. Using a specifically built index that measures the strictness of physical distancing rules in the 27 Brazilian states, this paper isolates the effect of mandatory physical distancing rules from other potential determinants of physical distancing. The article concludes that physical distancing is influenced by at least three variables: the strictness of mandatory physical distancing rules, the number of confirmed cases of covid-19, and the duration of rules. Evidence also indicates that the effect of physical distancing measures is relatively stronger than that of the number of cases -physical distancing is determined proportionally more by mandatory policies than people's awareness about the severity of the epidemic. These results have at least two policy implications. First, governments should adopt mandatory measures in order to increase physical distancing - rather than expect people to adopt them on their own. Second, the timing of adopting them is important, since people are unlikely to comply with them for long periods of time.","Moraes, Rodrigo Fracalossi de",Ciencia & saude coletiva,256,31

For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics, and vaccine development.","Lynch, Kara L; Whitman, Jeffrey D; Lacanienta, Noreen P; Beckerdite, Erica W; Kastner, Shannon A; Shy, Brian R; Goldgof, Gregory M; Levine, Andrew G; Bapat, Sagar P; Stramer, Susan L; Esensten, Jonathan H; Hightower, Allen W; Bern, Caryn; Wu, Alan H B",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,256,19

METHODS We used data on mobility and number of COVID-19 cases to longitudinally estimate associations between public compliance, as measured by human mobility, and the daily reproduction number and daily growth rate during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. RESULTS The 5 states mandated social distancing directives during March 19-24, 2020, and public compliance with mandates started to decrease in mid-April 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the daily reproduction number decreased from 2.41-5.21 to 0.72-1.19, and the daily growth rate decreased from 0.22-0.77 to -0.04 to 0.05 in the 5 states. The level of public compliance, as measured by the social distancing index (SDI) and daily encounter-density change, was high at the early stage of implementation but decreased in the 5 states. The SDI was negatively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, -0.04 to -0.01) and the daily growth rate (from -0.009 to -0.01). The daily encounter-density change was positively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, 0.24 to 1.02) and the daily growth rate (from 0.05 to 0.26).

Rural exposure during undergraduate medical training is promising as a means for overcoming the shortage of physicians outside urban areas, but the effectiveness is widely unknown. This integrative review assesses the effects of rural placements during undergraduate medical training on graduates' likelihood to take up rural practice. Methods: The paper presents the results of a longitudinal review of the literature published in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and elsewhere on the measurable effects of rural placements and internships during medical training on the number of graduates in rural practice. Results: The combined database and hand search identified 38 suitable primary studies with rather heterogeneous interventions, endpoints and results, mostly cross-sectional and control studies. The analysis of the existing evidence exhibited predominantly positive but rather weak correlations between rural placements during undergraduate medical training and later rural practice. Beyond the initial scope, the review underpinned rural upbringing to be the strongest predictor for rural practice. Conclusions: This review confirms that rural exposure during undergraduate medical training to contributes to recruitment and retention in nonurban settings. It can play a role within a broader strategy for overcoming the shortage of rural practitioners. Rural placements during medical education turned out to be particularly effective for rural-entry students. Given the increasing funding being directed towards medical schools to produce graduates that will work rurally, more robust high-quality research is needed.","Holst, Jens",International journal of environmental research and public health,256,23

Dietary flaxseed has demonstrated a protective effect against an MI. The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that dietary flaxseed supplementation before and after an MI regulates the expression of above-mentioned miRNAs to produce its cardioprotective effect. Animals were randomized after inducing MI by coronary artery ligation into: (a) sham MI with normal chow, (b) MI with normal chow, and (c-e) MI supplemented with either 10% milled flaxseed, or 4.4% flax oil enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or 0.44% flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside. The feeding protocol consisted of 2 weeks before and 8 weeks after the surgery. Dietary flax oil supplementation selectively upregulated the cardiac expression of miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b. The levels of collagen I expression were reduced in the flax oil group. We conclude that miR-133a, miR-135a, and miR-29b are sensitive to dietary flax oil, likely due to its rich ALA content. The cardioprotective effect of flaxseed in an MI could be due to modulation of these miRNAs.","Parikh, Mihir; Kura, Branislav; O'Hara, Kimberley A; Dibrov, Elena; Netticadan, Thomas; Slezak, Jan; Pierce, Grant N",Biomolecules,256,31

The aim of the work was to develop a novel integrated strategy for human bocavirus detection: heminested PCR assay combined with boiling lysis method of samples. The detection limit of the heminested PCR assay was 1.2 copies of a recombinant DNA plasmid, and no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses or bacteria was observed. By using the integrated strategy, a total of 202 secretions of the lower respiratory tract of children with acute respiratory diseases were collected and tested. The samples were treated and lysed in boiling lysis buffer rather than extracting viral DNA from secretions, then these sample lysates could be templates and tested by heminested PCR assay, and the amplification of HBoV DNA was detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed that, only 7 samples were found to be positive by conventional single-round PCR; importantly, the other new 41 samples were positive by heminested PCR assay. Additionally, the genomic viral DNA was extracted from all positive and some negative specimens, amplified, and sequenced. The results were perfectly consistent with those of the integrated strategy. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel integrated strategy (heminested PCR assay combined with boiling lysis method of samples) is a convenient, sensitive, cost-effective and reliable detective method for HBoV detection and will have broad application prospects in clinical diagnosis.","Chen, Long; Yao, Qing; Ma, Jing; Li, Jianning; Zhang, Qian; Yang, Yi; Li, Fang; Sun, Yuning",Journal of virological methods,256,9

Participants: Participants included undergraduate students (N = 365) at a rural, medium-sized university in Texas. Methods: Students were anonymously surveyed in the spring of 2018 on demographics, insurance status, perceived barriers of influenza vaccination, and vaccination status. Results: Nearly 90% of students had health insurance; however, only 30% of them received the influenza vaccination annually. The top two reasons for non-vaccination were the low perceived threat (20.20%) and having a busy schedule (11.10%). Having health insurance [OR: 2.84, CI: (1.16, 7.0)] and being in the younger age group (18-24) [OR: 1.98, CI: (1.11, 3.54)] were both positively associated with the annual vaccination status. Conclusion: Health education efforts should be focused on vaccination initiatives that increase awareness about the health benefits and ease of access, especially among the older age groups (> =25 years). Information on myths versus facts should also be disseminated.","Gandhi, Subi; Harris Bozer, Amber",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,256,16

Precise control of IFN responses is critical because insufficient expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread, whereas excessive ISG activation can result in IFN-related pathologies. Although both positive and negative regulatory factors control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that several ISGs regulate aspects of the IFN response themselves. In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify previously unknown regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified the strongly induced ISG encoding ETS variant transcription factor 7 (ETV7) as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response. However, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead, ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of antiviral ISGs that were particularly important for IFN-mediated control of influenza viruses. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a potential therapeutic target to increase innate antiviral responses and enhance IFN-based antiviral therapies.","Froggatt, Heather M; Harding, Alfred T; Chaparian, Ryan R; Heaton, Nicholas S",Science signaling,256,16

Evidence describing the quality and protocols of standardized tools for assessing walking capacity can facilitate their implementation. OBJECTIVE To synthesize existing literature describing test protocols and measurement properties of distance-limited walk tests in people post-stroke. METHODS Electronic database searches were completed in 2017. Records were screened and appraised for quality. RESULTS Data were extracted from 43 eligible articles. Among the 12 walk tests identified, the 10-metre walk test (10mWT) at a comfortable pace was most commonly evaluated. Sixty-three unique protocols at comfortable and fast paces were identified. Walking pace and walkway surface, but not walkway length, influenced walking speed. Intraclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.80-0.99 across walk tests. Measurement error values ranged from 0.04-0.40 and 0.06 to 0.20 for the 10mWT at comfortable and fast and paces, respectively. Across walk tests, performance was most frequently correlated with measures of strength, balance, and physical activity (r = 0.26-0.8, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The 10mWT has the most evidence of reliability and validity. Findings indicate that studies that include people with severe walking deficits, in acute and subacute phases of recovery, with improved quality of reporting, are needed.","Cheng, Darren Kai-Young; Dagenais, Matthieu; Alsbury-Nealy, Kyla; Legasto, Jean Michelle; Scodras, Stephanie; Aravind, Gayatri; Takhar, Pam; Salbach, Nancy Margaret",NeuroRehabilitation,256,5

One type of cell that may contribute to these immune responses is the γδ T lymphocyte, which plays a key role in immunosurveillance of the mucosal and epithelial barriers by rapidly responding to pathogens. Although found in low numbers in blood, γδ T cells consist the majority of tissue-resident T cells and participate in the front line of the host immune defense. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical protective role of γδ T cells in immune responses to other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. However, no studies have profoundly investigated these cells in COVID-19 patients to date. γδ T cells can be safely expanded in vivo using existing inexpensive FDA-approved drugs such as bisphosphonate, in order to test its protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2. To support this line of research, we review insights gained from previous coronavirus research, along with recent findings, discussing the potential role of γδ T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2. We conclude by proposing several strategies to enhance γδ T cell's antiviral function, which may be used in developing therapies for COVID-19.","Yazdanifar, Mahboubeh; Mashkour, Narges; Bertaina, Alice",Critical reviews in microbiology,256,16

METHODS The two training conditions were completed at least one week apart in 13 participants >1-year post-stroke. Voluntary wrist extensor muscle activation (motor unit (MU) recruitment thresholds and firing rate modulation in a ramp-hold handgrip task), ipsilesional corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential [MEP] amplitude) and transcallosal inhibition were measured Pre- and Post-training. RESULTS For MUs active both Pre and Post training, greater reductions in recruitment thresholds were found Post rTMS + RW training (p = 0.0001) compared to Sham rTMS + RW (p = 0.16). MU firing rate modulation increased following both training conditions (p = 0.001). Ipsilesional MEPs were elicited Pre and Post in only 5/13 participants. No significant changes were seen in ipsilesional corticospinal excitability and transcallosal inhibition measures (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Following a single rTMS + RW session in people >1-year post-stroke, changes were found in voluntary muscle activation of wrist extensor muscles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Narrative review RESULTS: Delayed activation of EMS for stroke symptoms by patients and witnesses deprives patients of rapid access to brain-saving therapies and occurs due to public unawareness of stroke features, cognitive and motor deficits produced by the stroke itself, and sleep onset. A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers. CONCLUSIONS The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset.

However, most HIV-positive persons initiate ART when their CD4 count decreases below 500 × 109 cells/L. Consequences of delayed ART on risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer, one of the most common reasons for death in HIV, are unclear. OBJECTIVE To estimate the long-term risk difference for cancer with the immediate ART strategy. DESIGN Multinational prospective cohort study. SETTING The D:A:D (Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs) study, which included HIV-positive persons from Europe, Australia, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS 8318 HIV-positive persons with at least 1 measurement each of CD4 cell count and viral load while ART-naive (study period, 2006 to 2016). MEASUREMENTS The parametric g-formula was used, with adjustment for baseline and time-dependent confounders (CD4 cell count and viral load), to assess the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer of immediate versus deferred (at CD4 counts <350 and <500 × 109 cells/L) ART initiation strategies. RESULTS During 64 021 person-years of follow-up, 231 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer and 272 of AIDS-defining cancer occurred among HIV-positive persons with a median age of 36 years (interquartile range, 29 to 43 years). With immediate ART, the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining cancer was 2.97% (95% CI, 2.37% to 3.50%) and that for AIDS-defining cancer was 2.50% (CI, 2.37% to 3.38%). Compared with immediate ART initiation, the 10-year absolute risk differences when deferring ART to CD4 counts less than 500 × 109 cells/L and less than 350 × 109 cells/L were 0.12 percentage point (CI, -0.01 to 0.26 percentage point) and 0.29 percentage point (CI, -0.03 to 0.73 percentage point), respectively, for non-AIDS-defining cancer and 0.32 percentage point (CI, 0.21 to 0.44 percentage point) and 1.00 percentage point (CI, 0.67 to 1.44 percentage points), respectively, for AIDS-defining cancer. LIMITATION Potential residual confounding due to observational study design. CONCLUSION In this young cohort, effects of immediate ART on 10-year risk for cancer were small, and further supportive data are needed for non-AIDS-defining cancer.

Cytoplasmic fluorescent discrete protein structures were observed in infected cells, corresponding to the vesicles containing the viral RNA replication complex. The vesicles were motile and aligned with microfilaments. Intracellular movement of the vesicles was inhibited when cells were infiltrated with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of microfilament polymerization. It was also observed that viral accumulation in the presence of this drug was reduced. These data indicate that microfilaments are used for vesicle movement and are necessary for virus production. Biogenesis of the vesicles was further investigated by infecting cells with two recombinant TuMV strains: one expressed 6K2GFP and the other expressed 6K2mCherry. Green- and red-only vesicles were observed within the same cell, suggesting that each vesicle originated from a single viral genome. There were also vesicles that exhibited sectors of green, red, or yellow fluorescence, an indication that fusion among individual vesicles is possible. Protoplasts derived from TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves were isolated. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, viral RNA synthesis sites were visualized as punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The viral proteins VPg-Pro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and cytoplasmic inclusion protein (helicase) and host translation factors were found to be associated with these structures. A single-genome origin and presence of protein synthetic machinery components suggest that translation of viral RNA is taking place within the vesicle.","Cotton, Sophie; Grangeon, Romain; Thivierge, Karine; Mathieu, Isabelle; Ide, Christine; Wei, Taiyun; Wang, Aiming; Laliberté, Jean-François",Journal of virology,256,20

The replication of SARS-CoV is highly dependent on host cell factors. However, relatively little is known about the cellular proteome changes that occur during SARS-CoV replication. Recently, we developed a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon and used it to screen inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. To identify host proteins important for SARS-CoV RNA replication, the protein profiles of the SARS-CoV replicon cells and parental BHK21 cells were compared using a quantitative proteomic strategy termed ""stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-mass spectrometry"" (SILAC-MS). Our results revealed that, among the 1,081 host proteins quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, 74 had significantly altered levels of expression. Of these, significantly upregulated BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) was selected for further functional studies. BAG3 is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, cellular stress response, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Our results show that inhibition of BAG3 expression by RNA interference led to significant suppression of SARS-CoV replication, suggesting the possibility that upregulation of BAG3 may be part of the machinery that SARS-CoV relies on for replication. By correlating the proteomic data with these functional studies, the findings of this study provide important information for understanding SARS-CoV replication.","Zhang, Liang; Zhang, Zhi-Ping; Zhang, Xian-En; Lin, Fu-Sen; Ge, Feng",Journal of virology,256,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who underwent elective robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery between February 2006 and December 2013 were identified. Robotic procedures were performed using the da Vinci robotic system. Patient demographic data and operative outcomes were prospectively collected in a computerized database and extracted for this study. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety eight patients were identified during the study period. One case was converted to conventional laparoscopy due to mechanical failure of the robot system before the procedure and excluded from review. The median age and body mass index of patients were 48 years and 23.0 kg/m², respectively. The majority (n=130, 43.6%) of operative procedures was radical hysterectomy, followed by endometrial cancer staging (n=112, 37.6%), total hysterectomy (n=39, 13.1%), and myomectomy (n=17, 5.7%). The median operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay were 208.5 min, 184.8 mL, and 8.9 days, respectively. The overall complication rate was 18.8% and that for only oncologic cases was 16.1%. Intraoperative complications (n=5, 1.7%) consisted of three vessel injuries, one bowel content leakage during an appendectomy during endometrial cancer staging and one case of bladder injury during radical hysterectomy. Early and late postoperative complications were 14.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Five patients (1.7%) experienced grade 3 complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification and therefore needed further intervention.

It is important for feline healthcare that donors are selected appropriately, and transfusions of blood or blood products are given to recipients that will benefit from them. Complications can occur, but can be largely avoided with careful donor management and recipient selection, understanding of blood type compatibility, and transfusion monitoring. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Feline blood transfusion, while potentially a lifesaving procedure, can also be detrimental to donor and recipient without precautions. Cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies to red cell antigens and severe reactions can occur with type-mismatched transfusions. Blood transfusions can also transmit infectious agents to the recipient, so donor testing is essential. Finally, donors must be in good health, and sedated as appropriate, with blood collected in a safe and sterile fashion to optimise the benefit to recipients. Transfusion reactions are possible and can be mild to severe in nature. Autologous blood transfusions and xenotransfusions may be considered in certain situations. EVIDENCE BASE These Guidelines have been created by a panel of authors convened by the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM), based on available literature. They are aimed at general practitioners to provide a practical guide to blood typing, cross-matching, and blood collection and administration.","Taylor, Samantha; Spada, Eva; Callan, Mary Beth; Korman, Rachel; Leister, Ellie; Steagall, Paulo; Lobetti, Remo; Seth, Mayank; Tasker, Séverine",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,256,20

Alberta's three new centers opened in 2010, 2013 and 2021 (projected). This study examined improvements in wait times and patient throughput between 2010 and 2020, and highlighted strategies that will support the sustainability and growth of clinical activity through to 2030. Significant improvement in ready to treat wait times for radiotherapy have resulted from opening two centers, and the provincial throughput for patients requiring systemic or radiotherapy has gone up by 16%.

Palliative care for people with serious illness and hospice services for people approaching the end of life are no exception. It is also well established that Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to have less knowledge about advance care planning and directives, hospice, and palliative care. Both qualitative and quantitative research has identified lack of awareness of palliative and hospice services as one of the major factors contributing to the underuse of these services by minority populations. However, an insufficient number of racial/ethnic comparative studies have been conducted to examine associations among various independent factors in relation to awareness of end-of-life, palliative care and advance care planning and directives. AIMS The main objective of this analysis was to examine correlates of awareness of palliative, hospice care and advance directives in a racially and ethnically diverse large sample of California adults. METHODS This cross-sectional study includes 2,328 adults: Hispanics (31%); non-Hispanic Blacks (30%); and non-Hispanic Whites (39%) from the Survey of California Adults on Serious Illness and End-of-Life 2019. Using multivariate analysis, we adjusted for demographic and socio-economic variables while estimating the potential independent impact of health status, lack of primary care providers, and recent experiences of participants with a family member with serious illnesses. RESULTS Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black participants are far less likely to report that they have heard about palliative and hospice care and advance directives than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. In this study, 75%, 74%, and 49% of Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic White participants, respectively, claimed that they have never heard about palliative care. Multivariate analysis of data show gender, age, education, and income all significantly were associated with awareness. Furthermore, being engaged with decision making for a loved one with serious illnesses and having a primary care provider were associated with awareness of palliative care and advance directives. DISCUSSION Our findings reveal that lack of awareness of hospice and palliative care and advance directives among California adults is largely influenced by race and ethnicity. In addition, demographic and socio-economic variables, health status, access to primary care providers, and having informal care giving experience were all independently associated with awareness of advance directives and palliative and hospice care. These effects are complex, which may be attributed to various historical, social, and cultural mechanisms at the individual, community, and organizational levels. A large number of factors should be addressed in order to increase knowledge and awareness of end-of-life and palliative care as well as completion of advance directives and planning. The results of this study may guide the design of multi-level community and theoretically-based awareness and training models that enhance awareness of palliative care, hospice care, and advance directives among minority populations.","Bazargan, Mohsen; Cobb, Sharon; Assari, Shervin; Kibe, Lucy W",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,256,19

AIMS This 48-week open-label extension study primarily investigated long-term safety of tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg b.d. and secondarily investigated efficacy as maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS Patients who had completed the phase 2b maintenance study, or withdrawn due to treatment failure, were enrolled. Patients in remission (Crohn's disease activity index <150) at baseline received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; all others received 10 mg b.d. A single dose adjustment was allowed after 8 weeks' fixed, open-label treatment. RESULTS Sixty-two patients received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; 88 received 10 mg b.d. Both groups had similar rates of adverse events and serious infections. Crohn's disease worsening was the most frequent adverse event for tofacitinib 5 (33.9%) and 10 mg b.d. (19.3%). Patients not in remission at baseline, receiving 10 mg b.d., had higher rates of serious adverse events (19.3%) and discontinuation attributed to insufficient clinical response (30.7%) vs 5 mg b.d. (8.1% and 9.7%, respectively). At week 48, of patients with baseline remission receiving 5 mg b.d., 87.9% maintained remission and 75.0% sustained remission as observed (46.8% and 38.7%, respectively, by non-responder imputation). Study design prevented between-dose efficacy comparisons. CONCLUSIONS No new safety signals emerged. Although both doses showed generally similar safety outcomes for overall adverse events, serious adverse events were more frequent for tofacitinib 10 than 5 mg b.d.

In this study, we assessed the prevalence and incidence of MG infection in MSM enrolled in the open-label phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial with on demand TDF/FTC for HIV prevention and the impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). METHODS 210 subjects were tested at baseline and at 6 months by real-time PCR assays for MG detection in urine samples, oro-pharyngeal and anal swabs. Resistance to azithromycin (AZM), to fluoroquinolones (FQ) and to doxycycline were investigated in the French National Reference Centre of bacterial STI. RESULTS The all-site prevalence of MG at baseline was 10.5% [6.3% in urine samples, 4.3% in anal swabs and 0.5% in throat swabs] and remained unchanged at 6 months whether or not PEP was used: 9.9% overall, 10.2% with PEP and 9.6% without. The overall rate of MG resistance (prevalent and incident cases) to AZM and FQ was 67.6% and 9.1%, respectively, with no difference between arms. An in vivo mutation of the MG 16S rRNA which could be associated with tetracycline resistance was observed in 12.5% of specimens tested. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of MG infection among MSM on PrEP was high and its incidence was not decreased by doxycycline prophylaxis with a similar high rate of AZM- and FQ-resistance, raising challenging issues for the treatment of this STI and supporting current recommendations to avoid testing or treatment of asymptomatic MG infection.","Berçot, Béatrice; Charreau, Isabelle; Clotilde, Rousseau; Delaugerre, Constance; Chidiac, Christian; Pialoux, Gilles; Capitant, Catherine; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, Nadège; Raffi, François; Pereyre, Sabine; Le Roy, Chloé; Senneville, Eric; Meyer, Laurence; Bébéar, Cécile; Molina, Jean-Michel",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,256,16

Yet, little is known about mental health status during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study aims to measure the prevalence of mental health disorders among patients with rheumatic diseases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic and to determine potential risk factors for major symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in participants. METHODS Participants with rheumatic diseases were asked to complete a questionnaire using a telephonic interview. Sociodemographic and rheumatic disease characteristics were recorded. Mental health status was assessed by the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7, and insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaires to detect depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively. RESULTS We included 307 patients in the survey. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent diagnosis (55%). Of all participants, 7.5% had known depression and 5.5% known anxiety. Mental health disorders were insomnia (34.9%), anxiety (33.2%), and depression (24.4%). Major symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression were noted in respectively, 19.9%, 12.4%, and 7.8% of participants. Risk factors for major insomnia were male gender (OR= 4.36, 95% CI 2.06 to 9.25; p<0.0001), low socioeconomic status (OR= 2.64, 95% CI 1.44 - 4.83; p<0.002) and having rheumatoid arthritis (OR= 2.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.84; p<0.036). Major anxiety was associated with low monthly income (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.01; p<0.026), and higher Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain (OR=1.795, 95% CI 1.074 to 2.994 ; p<0.026). Major depression was associated with worsening of rheumatic disease (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.26; p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS A high frequency of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was found in rheumatic patients.

To enable mechanistic insight into the coordinated morphogenic crosstalk between the epithelium and vasculature, we introduce a 3D microfluidic platform that juxtaposes a human mammary duct in proximity to a perfused endothelial vessel. Both compartments recapitulate stable architectural features of native tissue and the ability to undergo distinct forms of branching morphogenesis. Modeling HER2/ERBB2 amplification or activating PIK3CA(H1047R) mutation each produces ductal changes observed in invasive progression, yet with striking morphogenic and behavioral differences. Interestingly, PI3KαH1047R ducts also elicit increased permeability and structural disorganization of the endothelium, and we identify the distinct secretion of IL-6 as the paracrine cause of PI3KαH1047R-associated vascular dysfunction.

Although AA medications are associated with substantial weight gain, their tranquilizing effects may independently contribute to risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) perhaps, by a reduction in activity of hypoglossal or recurrent activity of laryngeal nerve on the upper motor airway musculature. METHODS We hypothesized that AA medications are associated with more severe OSA independent of weight and neck circumference. Medical intake data and polysomnographic studies of patients referred to community hospital sleep disorders center were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 49.1 years, 55.1% were male, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 33.8 kg/m. Sixty-eight patients (8.1%) were taking AA at the time of polysomnography. There were no differences in age, sex, neck circumference and BMI of AA versus non-AA patients. The mean (SE) apnea-hypopnea index values were 29.2 (3.5)/h in AA patients and 21.3 (0.8)/h in non-AA patients (P = 0.03). Thirty-four percent of AA patients had severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 30/h) compared with 23% of non-AA patients (P = 0.04). When adjusted for BMI, sex, and use of benzodiazepines and sleeping aids, the odds ratios of severe OSA in AA patients were 1.9 times in non-AA patients (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.3). CONCLUSIONS Atypical antipsychotic medication use may increase the risk of more severe OSA independent of weight and neck circumference.","Rishi, Muhammad Adeel; Shetty, Mahesh; Wolff, Armand; Amoateng-Adjepong, Yaw; Manthous, Constantine A",Clinical neuropharmacology,256,30

This study aimed to explore the effect of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on high glucose (HG)-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Materials and Methods The viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with different concentrations and times of EGCG was detected by CCK-8 assay. The expression levels of ROS, NO and BH4 in HUVECs after treatment were detected by respective ELISA kits. The expression of p-eNOS, eNOS, NOX4, bcl2, bax, cleaved-caspase3, caspase3, p-PI3K, p-AKT, PI3K and AKT in HUVECs was detected by Western blot analysis. The apoptosis of HUVECs after treatment was analyzed by TUNEL assay. Results The viability of HUVECs was not obviously changed when treated with different concentrations and times of EGCG. The expression of ROS, NOX4 and eNOS (monomer) was increased, while the expression of NO, p-eNOS, eNOS, BH4 and eNOS (dimer) was decreased in HUVECs of HG group. EGCG could gradually reverse the effect of high glucose on HG-treated HUVECs from 10 μM to 50 μM. The apoptosis of HUVECs was also increased in HG group and EGCG decreased the apoptosis of HUVECs. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was suppressed in HG-treated HUVECs while activated by EGCG treatment. When the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited by LY294002 (AKT inhibitor), the protective effect of EGCG on HG-treated HUVECs was weakened. Conclusion EGCG could inhibit eNOS uncoupling and alleviate endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis of HG-treated HUVECs by activating the PI3K/AKT/eNOS pathway.","Zhang, Zhiyong; Zhang, Daimin","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",256,16

METHODS Thirty-six elastase-induced aneurysms in rabbits were treated with flow diverting devices. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed angiographically immediately before they were sacrificed at 1 (n=6), 2 (n=4), 4 (n=8) or 8 weeks (n=18) after treatment. The aneurysms were classified into a fast occlusion group if they were completely or near completely occluded at 4 weeks or earlier and a slow occlusion group if they remained incompletely occluded at 8 weeks. The immediate post-treatment flow conditions in aneurysms of each group were quantified using subject-specific computational fluid dynamics and statistically compared. RESULTS Nine aneurysms were classified into the fast occlusion group and six into the slow occlusion group. Aneurysms in the fast occlusion group were on average significantly smaller (fast=0.9 cm, slow=1.393 cm, p=0.024) and had smaller ostia (fast=0.144 cm2, slow=0.365 cm2, p=0.015) than aneurysms in the slow occlusion group. They also had a lower mean post-treatment inflow rate (fast=0.047 mL/s, slow=0.155 mL/s, p=0.0239), kinetic energy (fast=0.519 erg, slow=1.283 erg, p=0.0468), and velocity (fast=0.221 cm/s, slow=0.506 cm/s, p=0.0582). However, the differences in the latter two variables were only marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS Hemodynamic conditions after flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms in rabbits are associated with the subsequent aneurysm occlusion time. Specifically, smaller inflow rate, kinetic energy, and velocity seem to promote faster occlusions, especially in smaller and small-necked aneurysms. These results are consistent with previous studies based on clinical series.","Chung, Bongjae; Mut, Fernando; Kadirvel, Ramanathan; Lingineni, Ravi; Kallmes, David F; Cebral, Juan R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,256,1

Risks are inherent during transport, so the anticipated benefits of transport must be weighed against the possible negative outcome during the transport. Adverse events are common in both in and out of hospital transports, the most common being equipment malfunctions. During inter-hospital transport, increased transfer time is associated with worse patient outcomes. The use of specialized teams with the transport of children has been shown to decrease adverse events. Intra-hospital transports often involve critically ill patients, which increases the likelihood of adverse events. Radiographic diagnostics are the most common in-hospital transport destination and the results often change the course of care. It is recommended that portable ventilators be used for transport, because studies show that use of a manual resuscitator alters blood gas values due to inconsistent ventilation. The performance of new generation transport ventilators has improved greatly and now allows for seamless transition from ICU ventilators. Diligent planning for and monitoring during transport may decrease adverse events and reduce risk.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,256,30

During the pandemic, treatment delay is being recommended in a nonquantitative, nonobjective, and nonpersonalized manner, and this approach may be associated with suboptimal outcomes. Quantitative integration of cancer mortality estimates and data on the consequences of treatment delay is needed to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Objective To obtain quantitative integration of cancer-specific and COVID-19-specific mortality estimates that can be used to make optimal decisions for individual patients and optimize resource allocation. Design, Setting, and Participants In this decision analytical model, age-specific and stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were adjusted by the probability of COVID-19 (individualized by county, treatment-specific variables, hospital exposure frequency, and COVID-19 infectivity estimates), COVID-19 mortality (individualized by age-specific, comorbidity-specific, and treatment-specific variables), and delay of cancer treatment (impact and duration). These model estimates were integrated into a web application (OncCOVID) to calculate estimates of the cumulative overall survival and restricted mean survival time of patients who received immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Using currently available information about COVID-19, a susceptible-infected-recovered model that accounted for the increased risk among patients at health care treatment centers was developed. This model integrated the data on cancer mortality and the consequences of treatment delay to aid treatment decisions. Age-specific and cancer stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 691 854 individuals with 25 cancer types who received cancer diagnoses in 2005 to 2006. Data from 5 436 896 individuals in the National Cancer Database were used to estimate the independent impact of treatment delay by cancer type and stage. In addition, data from 275 patients in a nested case-control study were used to estimate the COVID-19 mortality rate by age group and number of comorbidities. Data were analyzed from March 17 to May 21, 2020. Exposures COVID-19 and cancer.

Substantial heterogeneity was found regarding the association between delayed cancer treatment and net survival among patients with a given cancer type and stage, and these 2 variables were insufficient to discriminate the net impact of immediate vs delayed treatment. Individualized overall survival estimates were associated with patient age, number of comorbidities, treatment received, and specific local community estimates of COVID-19 risk. Conclusions and Relevance This decision analytical modeling study found that the OncCOVID web-based application can quantitatively aid in the resource allocation of individualized treatment for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Hartman, Holly E; Sun, Yilun; Devasia, Theresa P; Chase, Elizabeth C; Jairath, Neil K; Dess, Robert T; Jackson, William C; Morris, Emily; Li, Pin; Hochstedler, Kimberly A; Abbott, Madeline R; Kidwell, Kelley M; Walter, Vonn; Wang, Ming; Wang, Xi; Zaorsky, Nicholas G; Schipper, Matthew J; Spratt, Daniel E",JAMA oncology,256,31

Nucleic-acid based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection of COVID-19. However, the ""gold standard"" test pioneered by the United States Center for Disease Control & Prevention, takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply and relatively scarce qPCR machines. It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude. There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the ""gold-standard"" CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles. Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own labs. We hope that this review can urgently consolidate and disseminate information to aid researchers in designing and implementing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing.","Esbin, Meagan N; Whitney, Oscar N; Chong, Shasha; Maurer, Anna; Darzacq, Xavier; Tjian, Robert",RNA,256,20

The pharmaceutical industry is no exception, and the approval of the first 3D-printed tablet (Spiratam®) marked a revolution in the field. Several studies reported the fabrication of different dosage forms using a range of 3D printing techniques. Thermosensitive drugs compose a considerable segment of available medications in the market requiring strict temperature control during processing to ensure their efficacy and safety. Heating involved in some of the 3D printing technologies raises concerns regarding the feasibility of the techniques for printing thermolabile drugs. Studies reported that semi-solid extrusion (SSE) is the commonly used printing technique to fabricate thermosensitive drugs. Digital light processing (DLP), binder jetting (BJ), and stereolithography (SLA) can also be used for the fabrication of thermosensitive drugs as they do not involve heating elements. Nonetheless, degradation of some drugs by light source used in the techniques was reported. Interestingly, fused deposition modelling (FDM) coupled with filling techniques offered protection against thermal degradation. Concepts such as selection of low melting point polymers, adjustment of printing parameters, and coupling of more than one printing technique were exploited in printing thermosensitive drugs. This systematic review presents challenges, 3DP procedures, and future directions of 3D printing of thermo-sensitive formulations.","Abdella, Sadikalmahdi; Youssef, Souha H; Afinjuomo, Franklin; Song, Yunmei; Fouladian, Paris; Upton, Richard; Garg, Sanjay",Pharmaceutics,256,16

In addition, it aims to explore the value of social cognitive theory (SCT) in explaining these experiences. DESIGN Exploratory, deductive approach. METHODS Qualitative, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted from eight women who were members of a private Facebook group'. Data were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis, and SCT was used as a theoretical lens through which the data were interrogated. RESULTS A number of themes were identified from the women's experiences, with analysis uncovering the superordinate theme 'increased self-efficacy' which provided an understanding of how the group impacted women's experiences and aided them in breastfeeding success. The sub-themes of education, accessibility, online community, normalization, and extended goals provided a more detailed understanding of how self-efficacy was increased through group membership. CONCLUSION The symbiotic relationship between members of a social media group facilitates greater breastfeeding success and a longer duration of breastfeeding through the central concept of the SCT: reciprocal determinism. Therefore, it is posited that the SCT is a suitable theory of behaviour change which can potentially be used to develop interventions aiming to increase breastfeeding rates and duration.","Black, Rachel; McLaughlin, Marian; Giles, Melanie",British journal of health psychology,256,9

The purpose of this study was to explore the hypothesis that flexion deformity of the PIP joint in advanced trigger finger is caused by severe adhesion between the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons. Ten freshly frozen cadaveric hands were used in the experiments. After preparation of the extrinsic flexor, extrinsic extensor, and intrinsic muscle tendons, we applied weights to the flexor tendons and minimal tension to the extrinsic extensor and intrinsic muscle tendons. We then measured the initial flexion angles of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and PIP joints. Next, we measured the flexion angles of the MCP and PIP joints as increasing tension was applied to the extrinsic extensor and intrinsic muscle tendons, respectively. We repeated these experiments after constructing flexor tendon adhesion model. The initial flexion angles of the MCP and PIP joints were greater in the adhesion model, as were the average tensions required for full extension of these joints. Our results suggest that adhesion between two flexor tendons contributes to progression of flexion deformity in the PIP joint.","Kim, Jihyeung; Rhee, Seung Hwan; Gong, Hyun Sik; Oh, Sohee; Baek, Goo Hyun",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,256,17

This study therefore reports our experience with the novel silk vista baby (SVB) FDS and respective outcomes after 8 and 11 months with special respect to specific adverse events. Materials and Methods: Forty-four patients (mean age, 53 years) harboring 47 aneurysms treated with the SVB between June 2018 and December 2019 were included in our study. Clinical, procedural, and angiographic data were collected. Follow-ups were performed on average after 3, 8, and 11 months, respectively. Treatment effect was assessed using the O'Kelly Marotta (OKM) grading system. Results: Overall, angiographic follow-ups were available for 41 patients/45 aneurysms. Occlusion or significant reduction in aneurysmal perfusion (OKM: D1, B1-B3 and A2-A3) was observed in 98% of all aneurysms after 8 months. Only 2% of the treated aneurysms remained morphologically unaltered and without an apparent change in perfusion (OKM A1). Adverse events in the early post-interventional course occurred in seven patients; out of them, mRS-relevant morbidity at 90 days related to FDS treatment was observable in two patients. One death occurred in the context of severe SAH related to an acutely ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Conclusion: The SVB achieves sufficient occlusion rates of intracranial aneurysms originating from peripheral segments, which are comparable to prior established conventional FDS with acceptably low complication rates. However, alteration of a hemodynamic equilibrium in distal localizations requires special attention to prevent ischemic events.","Schüngel, Marie-Sophie; Quäschling, Ulf; Weber, Erik; Struck, Manuel Florian; Maybaum, Jens; Bailis, Nikolaos; Arlt, Felix; Richter, Cindy; Hoffmann, Karl-Titus; Scherlach, Cordula; Schob, Stefan",Frontiers in neurology,256,5

It is unknown whether it improves the diagnostic accuracy in young patients with intermediate pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD) and no prior cardiovascular events. METHODS We prospectively studied 101 patients by DSE and STE, followed by coronary angiography within 1 month. Significant CAD was defined as diameter stenosis ≥ 50%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis obtained global longitudinal strain (GLS) cutoff values of significant area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Mean age: 53 ± 8 years, 56% females, 49 had significant CAD (group 1) and 52 had normal/mild CAD (group 2); no significant baseline differences except more males in group 1 (P: .002). DSE sensitivity and specificity for CAD were 79.6% and 92.3%, respectively, positive predictive value (PPV): 90.6%, negative predictive value (NPV): 82.7%, and diagnostic accuracy: 86%. At peak stress, all strain parameters were significantly lower in group 1. However, GLS had the highest AUC: 0.88, P: <.001. GLS cutoff value ≤ -20.5 had 89.8% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity, 84.6% PPV, 89.8% NPV, and 87% diagnostic accuracy. Combining GLS cutoff with DSE had higher AUC than either alone (0.9, P < .001): 95.9% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity, 85.5% PPV, 95.7% NPV, and 90% diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION 2D-STE-derived GLS increases DSE precision to detect CAD in intermediate pretest probability patients: It improves DSE sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy. It is reproducible and has comparable specificity.","Elamragy, Ahmed A; Abdelwahab, Mohamed A; Elremisy, Dalia R; Hassan, Mohamed; Ammar, Waleed A; Taha, Hesham S",Echocardiography,256,1

Feltételezhetően ez a jelenség vezetett a súlyos akut légzőszervi szindróma koronavírus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) kialakulásához, mely 2019-ben jelent meg először emberekben, és néhány hónap leforgása alatt milliókat fertőzött meg az egész világon.

Introduction: Since the discovery of the microscope, we have known that individuals living in close proximity to each other share not only their visible habitat, but also invisible microorganisms that have adapted to some degree to their hosts. However, as human habitat expands and, in parallel, animal territory declines, new animal species can come into dangerous proximity, which may result in consequential transmission of microbes and different microbial behaviour in the new host. Presumably, this phenomenon led to the development of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in humans in 2019 and infected millions over the course of a few months worldwide. All possible means must be used to combat the pandemic and prevent further epidemics, which will require cooperation between professionals in human medicine and veterinary medicine as well as in the ecological, evolutionary and environmental sciences, within the framework of the global ""One Health"". In a spirit of working together for common goals, the authors of this study, a veterinarian and a human physician, summarize the knowledge that may be relevant to both professions for SARS-CoV-2. The origin of the virus, its natural and artificial occurrence in different animal species, and experiences with animal coronaviruses that may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of protection against it are presented.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) provides integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) which represents adequacy of LES relaxation. The Starlet HRM system is widely used in Japan; however, IRP values in achalasia/EGJOO patients assessed with the Starlet system have not been well studied. We propose the optimal cutoff of IRP for detecting achalasia/EGJOO using the Starlet system. METHODS Patients undergone HRM test using the Starlet system at our institution between July 2018 and September 2020 were included. Of these, we included patients with either achalasia or EGJOO and those who had normal esophageal motility without hiatal hernia. Abnormally impaired LES relaxation (i.e., achalasia and EGJOO) was diagnosed if prolonged esophageal emptying was evident based on timed barium esophagogram (TBE). RESULTS A total of 111 patients met study criteria. Of these, 48 patients were diagnosed with achalasia (n = 45 [type I, n = 20; type II, n = 22; type III, n = 3]) or EGJOO (n = 3). In the 48 patients who had a prolonged esophageal clearance based on TBE, IRP values distributed along a wide-range of minimal 14.1 to a maximal of 72.2 mmHg. The optimal cutoff value of IRP was 24.7 mmHg with sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 84.1% (AUC 0.94). CONCLUSION The optimal cutoff value of IRP to distinguish achalasia/EGJOO was ≥ 25 mmHg using the Starlet HRM system in our cohort. This indicates that the current proposed cutoff of 26 mmHg appears to be relevant.","Masuda, Takahiro; Yano, Fumiaki; Omura, Nobuo; Tsuboi, Kazuto; Hoshino, Masato; Yamamoto, SeRyung; Akimoto, Shunsuke; Sakashita, Yuki; Fukushima, Naoko; Kashiwagi, Hideyuki",Journal of gastroenterology,256,1

Associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has been reported as an efficient alternative to portal vein embolization (PVE) to induce growth of the future liver remnant (FLR). This method combines portal vein ligation with splitting of the liver parenchyma. Although shown to be efficient in introducing growth of the FLR and allowing for resection of the deportalized part of the liver one to two weeks after the first operation, this approach carries a significant mortality. Presentation of Case. ALPPS was applied to two elderly patients where PVE failed to stimulate sufficient growth of the FLR. In both cases, subsequent growth of the FLR allowed for successful resection of the liver lesions. The postoperative course was uneventful for both patients. Discussion. In both cases, the growth of the FLR was similar to what was previously reported when ALPPS has been performed, both patients underwent radical resections that would probably not have been safe after only the PVE. Conclusion. ALPPS used as rescue technique when PVE fails to stimulate sufficient growth of the FLR can be expected to deliver similar results as ALPPS ""Up front"". These cases also suggest that ALPPS is applicable to the elderly population.","Björnsson, Bergthór; Gasslander, Thomas; Sandström, Per",Case reports in surgery,256,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty systemically healthy patients (44.38 ± 8.2 years old, 11 smokers, 19 women) diagnosed with periodontitis stages III-IV were included. Each patient, with one single-rooted tooth, with one probing pocket depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm associated with horizontal bone loss, was treated by means of simplified papilla preservation flap (SPPF) and randomized to either test treatment (careful removal of the calculus with the tip of a blade, air polishing of the root surfaces with erythritol) or to the control group (scaling and root planing with hand curettes, ultrasonic instruments). PD, clinical attachment (CAL), bone sounding (BS), and radiographic bone level (BL) were evaluated at baseline and 12 months postsurgically. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients completed the 12-month follow-up (test: n = 14, control: n = 13). In both groups, statistically significant improvements were obtained (p < 0.05, mean CAL gain/PD reduction: test, 2.50 ± 1.60 mm/3.00 ± 0.96 mm; control, 2.85 ± 1.21 mm/3.38 ± 1.12 mm). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for any of the investigated parameters (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Within their limits, the present results indicate that the use of air polishing with an erythritol powder during periodontal surgery may represent a valuable minimally invasive adjunct following calculus removal by means of hand and ultrasonic instruments or a valuable alternative to these, for root surfaces without calculus. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The use of air polishing with an erythritol powder during periodontal surgery appears to represent a valuable minimally invasive adjunct following calculus removal by means of hand and ultrasonic instruments or a valuable alternative to these, for root surfaces without calculus.","Cosgarea, Raluca; Jepsen, Søren; Fimmers, Rolf; Bodea, Aura; Eick, Sigrun; Sculean, Anton",Clinical oral investigations,256,1

We prioritized SNPs in IFITM3 on the basis of putative biological function and identified rs34481144 in the 5' UTR. We found evidence of a new association of rs34481144 with severe influenza in three influenza-infected cohorts characterized by different levels of influenza illness severity. We determined a role for rs34481144 as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for IFITM3, with the risk allele associated with lower mRNA expression. The risk allele was found to have decreased IRF3 binding and increased CTCF binding in promoter-binding assays, and risk allele carriage diminished transcriptional correlations among IFITM3-neighboring genes, indicative of CTCF boundary activity. Furthermore, the risk allele disrupts a CpG site that undergoes differential methylation in CD8+ T cell subsets. Carriers of the risk allele had reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells in their airways during natural influenza infection, consistent with IFITM3 promoting accumulation of CD8+ T cells in airways and indicating that a critical function for IFITM3 may be to promote immune cell persistence at mucosal sites.Our study identifies a new regulator of IFITM3 expression that associates with CD8+ T cell levels in the airways and a spectrum of clinical outcomes.","Allen, E Kaitlynn; Randolph, Adrienne G; Bhangale, Tushar; Dogra, Pranay; Ohlson, Maikke; Oshansky, Christine M; Zamora, Anthony E; Shannon, John P; Finkelstein, David; Dressen, Amy; DeVincenzo, John; Caniza, Miguela; Youngblood, Ben; Rosenberger, Carrie M; Thomas, Paul G",Nature medicine,256,33
94915,94915,94915,NMR-based analysis of metabolites in urine provides rapid diagnosis and etiology of pneumonia.,14.8033905,6.8063855,2010,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES To minimize acute postoperative pain, a new formulation of slowly released bupivacaine was developed. METHODS Bupivacaine was microencapsulated at 60% (wt/wt) in poly-lactide-co-glycolide polymers and characterized for physicochemical properties and bupivacaine release kinetics. This formulation was injected around the rat sciatic nerve to produce an antinociceptive effect to toe pinch. Mechanical hyperalgesia following lateral plantar paw incision in rats was assessed for 7 to 14 days when the bupivacaine slow-release formulation was placed at the ipsilateral sciatic nerve and compared with the hyperalgesia that developed with various controls. RESULTS Bupivacaine was released in vitro at a relatively constant rate over a period of ≈ 72 to 96 hours. Complete antinociception, shown as no response to toe pinch, lasted for 23 ± 7 hours, with a half-recovery time of 42 ± 8 hours after sciatic nerve injection of 0.4 mL of the microspheres delivering 34 mg of bupivacaine. Solutions of 0.5% (wt/vol) bupivacaine-HCl (0.1 mL) produced complete antinociception for less than 2 hours and recovery half-times of 2 hours. Postincisional mechanical hyperalgesia, shown by increased withdrawal responses to von Frey filaments, was absent for 24 hours and was lower than control for 96 hours, when the sciatic nerve was blocked by bupivacaine microspheres, whereas the 0.5% bupivacaine solution reduced postincisional pain for only 4 hours. CONCLUSIONS Corresponding to its far greater functional blocking time, the microsphere-bupivacaine formulation was able to significantly reduce postoperative pain below control levels for up to 4 days. These findings of several days of postoperative pain relief, for an injectable formulation containing a single active agent, present an improved and potentially promising therapy to prevent acute pain after surgery.","Ohri, Rachit; Blaskovich, Phillip; Wang, Jeffrey Chi-Fei; Pham, Lan; Nichols, Gary; Hildebrand, William; Costa, Daniel; Scarborough, Nelson; Herman, Clifford; Strichartz, Gary",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,256,1

Hemorrhagic complications (HC) are usually the result of stapler line bleeding and are probably underreported. The previous incidence of HC in our department including minor bleeding and late hematomas was 15.0 %. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of stapler line reinforcement (SLR) and intraoperative blood pressure control on HC after LSG. METHODS Between February 2013 and March 2014, patients who were admitted to our department for LSG were randomly assigned to one of three arms: stapler line application of biologic glue--Evicel™ (E), over suture of the stapler line (S) or control (C). Surgical technique in all arms included blood pressure elevation to 140 mmHg before termination of the procedure. Data is presented as mean ± SD or median (IQR 25-75). RESULTS One hundred sixty-five patients were randomized: 49 to E, 49 to S, and 67 to C. There were no demographic differences between arms. Operative time was significantly longer in S than in E and C arms (74 ± 21 vs. 64 ± 23 and 54 ± 19 min, respectively). ∆Hb was significantly lower in the S group. Packed cells were used in two from E and one from C arms. Late infected hematoma occurred in three (1.8 %) patients: one from E and two from C arms. Leak rate was 1.2 %: one from S and one from C arms. LOS was the same. No patients were re-operated due to bleeding. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized trial, routine elevation of systolic blood pressure to 140 mmHg and over suture of the staple line in LSG minimized HC, with reasonable prolongation of the procedure.","Sroka, Gideon; Milevski, Daria; Shteinberg, Dan; Mady, Husam; Matter, Ibrahim",Obesity surgery,256,31

The vulnerability index was developed in five steps as follows: (1) determining the principles and components of employees' susceptibility and resilience, (2) weighting the principles and components, (3) converting the levels of components to the sub-index values, (4) introducing the aggregation functions, and (5) characterizing the vulnerability index values in five categories as very high (80-100), high (65-79), medium (50-64), low (30-49), and very low (0-29). The average values of susceptibility, resilience, and vulnerability index of the employees were determined to be 35.2±15.0, 73.9±17.0, and 32.9±12.7, respectively. The average resilience of the employees was more desirable than their average susceptibility. The distribution of the employees into the vulnerability index categories was 46.3% for very low, 41.9% for low, 3.6% for medium, and 8.2% for high. The worst cases of susceptibility and resilience principles were exposure to contaminated surfaces (59.1±22.8) and top management commitment (66.6±23.1). The elderly staff (especially over 50 years old), employees with low education levels, and employees in private and self-employment sectors were significantly more vulnerable (p value < 0.01) from the COVID-19 pandemic. The principles with significant incremental effects on the vulnerability index (p value < 0.05) were respectively top management commitment (+1.78), exposure to COVID-19 patients at work (+1.36), exposure to contaminated surfaces (+0.82), installing clear shields and wearing PPE (+0.59), observance of social distancing (+0.48), and just culture (+0.22).

The objective of this study is to describe the experience of US family planning providers with the rapid adoption of telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during this period. STUDY DESIGN This is a cross-sectional web-based survey of family planning providers practicing in the United States. RESULTS A total of 172 providers completed the survey (34% response rate). Of these, 156 (91%) provided telemedicine services in the two months preceding the survey. Most (78%) were new to telemedicine. About half (54%) referred less than a quarter of contraception patients for in-person visits, and 53% stated that the most common referral reason was LARC insertion. A majority of providers strongly agree that telemedicine visits are an effective way to provide contraceptive counseling (80%), and that this service should be expanded after the pandemic (84%). If asked to provide telemedicine visits after the pandemic, 64% of providers would be very happy about it. Many providers used personal phones or smartphones to conduct telemedicine visits but stated that ideal devices would be work-issued computers, tablets, or phones. More than half (59%) of providers prefer video over phone visits. CONCLUSIONS Family planning clinicians in the United States reported a positive experience with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and believe that this service should be expanded. Clinicians seem to prefer using work-issued devices and conducting video rather than phone visits.","Stifani, Bianca M; Avila, Karina; Levi, Erika E",Contraception,256,1

RECENT FINDINGS Approximately 1 million people >65 years have CAP in the US per year, which is more than previously reported (or realized). Older adults are vulnerable to the increasing prevalence of viral CAP, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emphasizes, but pneumococcus is still the most common pathogen to cause CAP. Racial disparities continue to need to be addressed in order to improve early and late outcomes of older adults with CAP. SUMMARY The epidemiology of CAP, specifically for older adults is changing. More recent pathogen incidence studies have included culture, as well as newer microbiological methods to determine etiology. Current disparities among disadvantaged populations, including African-Americans, result in more comorbidities which predisposes to more severe CAP. However, outcomes in the hospital between races tend to be similar, and outcomes between age groups tends to be worse for older compared to younger adults. Finally, the cost of CAP is significant compared to diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction and stroke.","Furman, Christian Davis; Leinenbach, Angela; Usher, Ronnita; Elikkottil, Jaseena; Arnold, Forest W",Current opinion in infectious diseases,256,1

Three different models of thermographic image analyses were used to obtain the mean temperature of 9 ROIs: A) ThermoHuman (automatic definition of ROIs using ThermoHuman® software), B) Manual (manual delimitation of ROIs by proportion criteria), and C) Manual-TH (manual delimitation of ROIs in an attempt to replicate the regions analyzed by ThermoHuman). ThermoHuman resulted in an 86% reduction in time involved compared to manual delimitation. Fourteen of the 120 images (12%) presented some error in one or more of the ROI delimitations. Although the three procedures presented significant differences between them (53% in the comparison between ThermoHuman and Manual, 47% between ThermoHuman and Manual-TH, and 28% between Manual and Manual-TH), all differences had a small effect size (ES 0.2-0.4) or lower (ES < 0.2). Bland-Altman plots showed similar 95% limits of agreement between the three procedures before and after running. Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis of the three procedures presented excellent reliability (ICC>0.8). In conclusion, ThermoHuman® software was observed to be time-saving for image analysis with excellent reliability. Although results suggest that ThermoHuman® and manual methods are both valid in themselves, combining them is not recommended due to the differences observed between them.","Requena-Bueno, Lara; Priego-Quesada, Jose Ignacio; Jimenez-Perez, Irene; Gil-Calvo, Marina; Pérez-Soriano, Pedro",Journal of thermal biology,256,1

Primary donor-derived infection can be associated with severe and rapidly fatal non-neoplastic disease, and diagnosis is made with high HHV-8 DNAemia. METHODS We carried out an international survey to investigate the current approach to HHV-8 screening and management in SOT since a protocol has not been established by international guidelines. RESULTS A total of 51 transplant centers from 15 countries filled out the survey. HHV-8-associated diseases in SOT have been diagnosed during the previous 5 years in 67% of centers. Pre-transplant serological screening is performed in 17 centers (33%) and post-transplant HHV-8 nucleic acid testing (NAT) monitoring is performed in 21 centers (41%). Performing HHV-8 NAT monitoring and serological screening were found associated with having diagnosed in the previous 5 years a non-malignant HHV-8-associated disease. CONCLUSIONS Serological pre-transplant screening of donors and recipients and post-transplant HHV-8 NAT monitoring recommendations should be standardized.

This raises concerns about the practice of nursing management and the use of codes of professional and managerial conduct. Some responses to such failures seem to assume that codes of conduct will ensure or at least increase the likelihood that ethical management will be practised. Codes of conduct are general principles and rules of normative standards, including ethical standards, and guides for action of agents in particular roles. Nurse managers seem to stride two roles. Contra some accounts of the roles of a professional (nurse) and that of a manager, it is claimed that there is no intrinsic incompatibility of the roles though there is always the possibility that it could become so and likewise for codes of conduct. Codes of conduct can be used to support nurse managers in making practical decisions via an 'outside in' approach with an emphasis on the use of principles and an 'inside out' approach with an emphasis on the agent's character. It is claimed that both approaches are necessary, especially as guides to ethical action. However, neither is sufficient for action because judgement and choice will always be required (principles always underdetermine action) as will a conducive environment that positively influences good judgement by being supportive of the basic principles and values of healthcare institutions. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has created a unique set of circumstances in which the practical judgement, including ethical judgement, of nurse managers at all levels is being tested. However, the pandemic could be a turning point because staff and institutions (temporarily) freed from managerialism have demonstrated excellent practice supportive of ethical and other practical decision making. Organisations need to learn from this post pandemic.","Newham, Roger; Hewison, Alistair",Nursing ethics,256,12

This device is a self-anchoring barbed suture that obviates the need for knot tying. The goal of this initial feasibility study was to investigate the use of the barbed suture in gastrointestinal enterotomy closure. A randomized study of 12 pigs comparing enterotomy closure with barbed versus a nonbarbed suture of similar tensile strength was performed. To this end, 25 mm enterotomies were made in the stomach (1 control, 1 treatment), jejunum (2 controls, 2 treatments), and descending colon (1 control, 1 treatment). Animals were killed at 3, 7, and 14 days postoperatively (4 each group) and their gastrointestinal tracts harvested; 6 of the 8 enterotomies from each pig underwent burst strength testing. The remaining 2 were fixed in formalin and sent for histological examination. All 12 pigs survived until they were killed without any major complications. Enterotomy closure with barbed suture revealed adhesion scores, burst strength pressures, and histology scores that were similar to those for the control. Jejunal closures resulted in 6 failures at 7 days (3 control, 3 barbed) and 4 failures at 14 days (2 control, 2 barbed). The barbed suture significantly reduced suturing time in the stomach, jejunum, and colon. The V-Loc wound closure device appears to offer comparable gastrointestinal closure to 3-0 Maxon while being significantly faster. Further studies with V-Loc are required to assess its use in laparoscopic surgery.","Demyttenaere, Sebastian V; Nau, Peter; Henn, Matthew; Beck, Catherine; Zaruby, Jeffrey; Primavera, Michael; Kirsch, David; Miller, Jeffrey; Liu, James J; Bellizzi, Andrew; Melvin, W Scott",Surgical innovation,256,30

METHODS A cohort of patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary TKA at two hospitals (a regional university hospital and a capital's metropolitan hospital) was prospectively followed for 12 months. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 4 postoperative time-points, with the use of self-reported measurements for pain, physical function and depression with the following evaluation tools: Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], Knee Society Scoring system [KSS], Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, [CES-D10] and visual analog scale [VAS] for pain). General linear modelling for repeated measures was used to evaluate the effect of each independent variable including clinical and sociodemographic data. Differences between groups at different time points were tested by the independent samples t-test. RESULTS Of the 224 eligible patients, 204 (162 females, mean age 69.2) were included in the analysis. Response rate at one year was 90%. At 6 weeks after surgery, despite improvement in pain and alleviation of the depressive mood, the physical function remained less satisfactory. Females presented lower scores in terms of quality of life, both preoperatively and 6 weeks after TKA. Significant improvement was already experienced at 3 months postoperatively. According to WOMAC, KSS, CES-D10 and pain VAS scores the Qol was significantly improved 12 months after TKA (P < 0.001). CES-D10 score was positively correlated with WOMAC and pain VAS scores at all the time points assessed (P < 0.001). Age, body mass index (BMI), place of residence, level of education and social support were not significant predictors of QoL after TKA. CONCLUSIONS Patients experienced great improvement in their QoL after TKA in spite of a less satisfactory physical function in the first 6 weeks after surgery, with noticeable differences in the QoL among genders in the same time period. After that period all patients experienced significant improvement for all the measured parameters, until the third postoperative month with smaller changes thereafter.","Papakostidou, Ippolyti; Dailiana, Zoe H; Papapolychroniou, Theodoros; Liaropoulos, Lycurgos; Zintzaras, Elias; Karachalios, Theophilos S; Malizos, Konstantinos N",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,256,16

Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center. METHODS An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into ""high risk,"" ""intermediate risk,"" and ""undetermined risk"" for both isolation and testing. RESULTS A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died. About 1.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10.3% to the general ward, and 6.4% were isolated. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 (0.1%) and 127 (3.4%) tested positive for atypical infection; 1471 patients were tested for COVID-19; 583 were stratified as high-risk, 781 as intermediate-risk, and 107 as undetermined-risk patients. CONCLUSION Rapid response for infection control is a paramount in the ED to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. The FFS helped divide the flow of high- and intermediate-risk patients; it also decreased the ED workload during a surge of febrile patients. A graded approach to testing uses risk stratification to prevent nosocomial infection of asymptomatic patients. A graded approach to isolation enables efficient allocation of scarce medical resources according to risk stratification.","Chang, Julia Chia-Yu; Chen, You-Hsu; Lin, Meng-Chen; Li, Yi-Jing; Hsu, Teh-Fu; Huang, Hsien-Hao; Yen, David Hung-Tsang",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,256,25

In a cohort study of adult (>18 years) patients testing positive for COVID-19 (Jan 01, 2020-June 21, 2021) from 56 sites across the United States identified using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Enclave, we used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess time to MARCE after COVID-19 diagnosis in those with and without SOT. We examined the exposure of age-stratified recipient sex overall and separately in kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplant recipients. 3,996 (36.4%) SOT and 91,646 (4.8%) non-SOT patients developed MARCE. Risk of post-COVID outcomes differed by transplant allograft type with heart and kidney recipients at highest risk. Males with SOT were at increased risk of MARCE, but to a lesser degree than the non-SOT cohort (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98 for SOT and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.60-0.62 for non-SOT (females versus males)).

A growing body of evidence suggests TE possess potent biological activity not shared by TCP. The primary objective of this work was to determine the concentrations of TE (200 mg mixed TE, b.i.d.) and TCP [200 mg α-TCP, b.i.d.)] in vital tissues and organs of adults receiving oral supplementation. Eighty participants were studied. Skin and blood vitamin E concentrations were determined from healthy participants following 12 wk of oral supplementation of TE or TCP. Vital organ vitamin E levels were determined by HPLC in adipose, brain, cardiac muscle, and liver of surgical patients following oral TE or TCP supplementation (mean duration, 20 wk; range, 1-96 wk). Oral supplementation of TE significantly increased the TE tissue concentrations in blood, skin, adipose, brain, cardiac muscle, and liver over time. α-TE was delivered to human brain at a concentration reported to be neuroprotective in experimental models of stroke. In prospective liver transplantation patients, oral TE lowered the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score in 50% of patients supplemented, whereas only 20% of TCP-supplemented patients demonstrated a reduction in MELD score. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence demonstrating that orally supplemented TE are transported to vital organs of adult humans. The findings of this study, in the context of the current literature, lay the foundation for Phase II clinical trials testing the efficacy of TE against stroke and end-stage liver disease in humans.","Patel, Viren; Rink, Cameron; Gordillo, Gayle M; Khanna, Savita; Gnyawali, Urmila; Roy, Sashwati; Shneker, Bassel; Ganesh, Kasturi; Phillips, Gary; More, J Layne; Sarkar, Atom; Kirkpatrick, Robert; Elkhammas, Elmahdi A; Klatte, Emily; Miller, Michael; Firstenberg, Michael S; Chiocca, E Antonio; Nesaretnam, Kalanithi; Sen, Chandan K",The Journal of nutrition,256,1

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the replication and propagation of the virus in the host cells. Inhibiting the protease blocks the replication of the virus; therefore it is considered as an attractive therapeutic target. Here we describe the screening of the DrugBank database, a public repository for small molecule therapeutics, to identify approved or experimental phase drugs that can be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The initial screening was performed on more than 13,000 drug entries in the target database using an energy optimised pharmacophore hypothesis AARRR. A sub-set of the molecules selected based on the fitness score was further screened using molecular docking by sequentially filtering the molecules through the high throughput virtual screening, extra precision and standard precision docking modalities. The best hits were subjected to binding free energy estimation using the MM-GBSA method. Approved drugs viz, Cobicistat, Larotrectinib and Simeprevir were identified as potential candidates for repurposing. Drugs in the discovery phase identified as inhibitors include the known cysteine protease inhibitors, Calpain inhibitor IV and an experimental cathepsin F inhibitor. In order to analyse the stability of the binding interactions, the known cysteine protease inhibitors viz, Simeprevir, calpain inhibitor IV and the cathepsin F inhibitor in complex Mpro were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations at 100 ns. Based on the results Simeprevir was found to be a strong inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, few studies have examined relevant risk factors for pandemic-related MH issues. METHODS A link to an online survey was posted from April 8th - June 11th, 2020 which included questions regarding COVID-19 experience, perceived impact of the pandemic on life domains (e.g., social communication, finances), behavioural alterations (e.g., online activities, substance use), and MH treatment history. Current psychiatric symptom severity and impairment were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS Overall, 632 individuals (82% female, mean age:42.04 ± 16.56) in Canada and the United States completed the survey. While few reported contracting COVID-19 (0.5%), the impact of the pandemic was evident, with a vast majority reporting anxiety around COVID-19 infecting loved ones (88%). Almost half (43%) reported previous MH treatment and 31% met criteria for GAD, 29% for MDD and 63% reported significantly high levels of stress. Female sex, younger age and past MH treatment emerged as significant predictors of these issues(p < .01). Age-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on life domains, substance use, and online activity were also noted. CONCLUSION The findings from the current sample add to the growing literature suggesting negative effects of COVID-19 on MH, while highlighting specific risk factors. Age may be an important factor in predicting MH during this pandemic.","Turna, Jasmine; Zhang, Jasmine; Lamberti, Nina; Patterson, Beth; Simpson, William; Francisco, Ana Paula; Bergmann, Carolina Goldman; Ameringen, Michael Van",Journal of psychiatric research,256,16

METHODS HUVECs were divided randomly into control group, A/R group, aODN/TF+A/R group, sense oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN/TF) + A/R group and mismatched oligodeoxynucleotide (mODN/TF) + A/R group, in the latter 3 groups, HUVECs were transfected with aODN/TF, sODN/TF and mODN/TF respectively. HUVECs in all A/R groups underwent 3 hrs of anoxia and followed by 2 hrs of reoxygenation. In order to investigate the potential mechanisms of how increased TF may contribute to A/R injury in HUVECs, another set of HUVECs were incubated with human recombinant active site blocked factor VII (FVIIai) during A/R. RESULTS After A/R, TF expression at both mRNA and protein level was increased, furthermore, cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX and NO were declined, while LDH, MDA and ET-1 were overproduced (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus control group). In HUVECs of aODN/TF+A/R group, however, TF expression was inhibited, while the declined cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX, NO as well as the enhanced LDH, MDA and ET-1 levels occurred during A/R were ameliorated and reversed effectively (P<0.05 to 0.01 versus those in other A/R groups). The results also showed that ROS was increased and PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase were all activated after A/R (P<0.001 versus HUVECs under normoxia), while FVIIai inhibited the increment of ROS, PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase, and improved the changes of TF:C, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX, cell viability and LDH occurred during A/R (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus HUVECs without FVIIai treatment). CONCLUSION Tissue factor plays an important role in the development of HUVECs injury induced by anoxia-reoxygenation, inhibition of TF with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is an effective approach to ameliorate the damage.","Yin, Jun; Luo, Xin Guo; Yu, Wen Jun; Liao, Jing Yuan; Shen, You Jin; Zhang, Ze Wen","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",256,1

Both treatment and survivorship pose challenges to fostering social connections. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review of the experience of social isolation and connectedness in adolescents with cancer and adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted following PRISMA Guidelines. Eligible articles included original peer-reviewed research published in English between January 2000 and April 2020 that reported on social domains of patients and survivors of cancer between the ages of 10-21. Initial database search identified 4606 articles with 43 studies meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS Results were synthesized into four domains: (1) the prevalence of connectedness/isolation; (2) risk factors associated with social isolation; (3) protective factors against social isolation; (4) the impact of social isolation on psychological health. Overall, adolescent patients and survivors of cancer have satisfactory social connectedness. However, certain subgroups including those with central nervous system tumors are at higher risk of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS In general, adolescent cancer patients and survivors report levels of social connectedness consistent with healthy adolescent population norms. The risk and protective factors identified in this review may help serve as important indicators for psychosocial screening and interventions. These findings are particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era as all adolescents face challenges to social connections and psychosocial development.","Pahl, Daniel A; Wieder, Matthew S; Steinberg, Dara M",Journal of adolescence,256,1

METHODS Twenty-eight healthy individuals underwent 8 cm H2O CPAP ventilation with FIO2 of 0.21 and 0.5. Each was sequentially tested in the following order: using the helmet without humidification at ambient temperature; with humidification with unheated chamber water; and with humidification with the chamber water at 31°C, 34°C, and 37°C. At each setting, after a 20 min stabilization period, measurements were taken. Comfort level at each setting was evaluated using a visual analog scale rated zero (least comfortable) to 10 (most comfortable). RESULTS Temperature and relative and absolute humidity inside the helmet increased; however, the comfort scores significantly decreased as the humidification chamber water temperature increased. Regardless of the FIO2, statistically significantly highest comfort scores were obtained when humidification water, with and without active humidification, was at ambient temperature. Unacceptable absolute humidity was obtained only without humidification at room temperature when FIO2 was 0.5. CONCLUSIONS With the clinical use of a helmet, for patient comfort and mucosal humidification during CPAP, the most desirable conditions are likely to be obtained by humidifying without heating, that is by leaving the water in the humidifier chamber at room temperature.","Ueta, Kazuyoshi; Tomita, Toshiji; Uchiyama, Akinori; Ohta, Noriyuki; Iguchi, Naoya; Goto, Yukiko; Fujino, Yuji",Respiratory care,256,28

Occasionally, alternative perfusion access is required to prevent perfusion site-related complications. In this study, the feasibility of alternative perfusion strategies was verified by comparing the postoperative outcomes and complications. METHODS The records of 91 consecutive patients (68 women, 23 men; mean age 40.7 ± 16.5 years) who underwent atrial septal defect (ASD) closure via a right minithoracotomy approach between January 2009 and September 2014 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those with single femoral arterial access (SF group, n = 84), and those with alternative perfusion access (ALT group, n = 7, bilateral femoral arterial cannulation in 6, side-arm graft anastomosed to the femoral artery in 1). RESULTS Femoral artery diameter was smaller in the ALT group than in the SF group (6.5 ± 0.5 vs. 7.3 ± 1.0 mm, P = 0.013). Operating time was longer in the ALT group than in the SF group (259.2 ± 54.0 vs. 208.3 ± 54.9 min, P = 0.031). One patient was converted to ascending aortic cannulation owing to high perfusion pressure. Postoperative major cardiac or cerebrovascular events, such as death, stroke, or myocardial infarction, did not occur in either group. CONCLUSIONS Alternative perfusion access was safe in ASD closure via a right minithoracotomy approach. Precise preoperative evaluation of the iliofemoral artery is important for choosing the appropriate perfusion strategy.","Kitahara, Hiroto; Okamoto, Kazuma; Kudo, Mikihiko; Yoshitake, Akihiro; Ito, Takahito; Hayashi, Kanako; Inaba, Yu; Akamatsu, Yuta; Shimizu, Hideyuki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,256,31

METHODS Retrospective descriptive case series. RESULTS The intravenous administration of indocyanine green for ophthalmic angiography resulted in a transient drop in oxygen saturation as measured by Nellcor fingertip pulse oximetry in three children with retinoblastoma receiving indocyanine green-guided transpupillary thermotherapy. The magnitude of reduction ranged from 92% to 94% from an initial reading of 99% to 100% in each case, with an average duration of 3 minutes. Concurrent measurement of blood pressure, pulse, and expired CO2 showed no changes during this process. CONCLUSION Administration of intravenous indocyanine green resulted in a transient desaturation by oximetry during transpupillary thermotherapy for children with retinoblastoma under anesthesia because of the fluorescent dye's absorption of red light in a manner similar to that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, thereby leading to transient instrument misinterpretation and miscalculation of arterial oxygenation.","Ediriwickrema, Lilangi S; Francis, Jasmine H; Arslan-Carlon, Vittoria; Dalecki, Paul H; Brodie, Scott E; Marr, Brian P; Abramson, David H",Retinal cases & brief reports,256,5

Our aim was to describe collateral filling with dynamic CTA and assess the relationship with infarct volume at follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS We selected patients with acute ischemic stroke due to proximal MCA occlusion. Patients underwent NCCT, single-phase CTA, and whole-brain CT perfusion/dynamic CTA within 9 hours after stroke onset. For each patient, a detailed assessment of the extent and velocity of arterial filling was obtained. Poor radiologic outcome was defined as an infarct volume of ≥70 mL. The association between collateral score and follow-up infarct volume was analyzed with Poisson regression. RESULTS Sixty-one patients with a mean age of 67 years were included. For all patients combined, the interval that contained the peak of arterial filling in both hemispheres was between 11 and 21 seconds after ICA contrast entry. Poor collateral status as assessed with dynamic CTA was more strongly associated with infarct volume of ≥70 mL (risk ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) than with single-phase CTA (risk ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5). Four subgroups (good-versus-poor and fast-versus-slow collaterals) were analyzed separately; the results showed that compared with good and fast collaterals, a similar risk ratio was found for patients with good-but-slow collaterals (risk ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7-2.4). CONCLUSIONS Dynamic CTA provides a more detailed assessment of collaterals than single-phase CTA and has a stronger relationship with infarct volume at follow-up. The extent of collateral flow is more important in determining tissue fate than the velocity of collateral filling. The timing of dynamic CTA acquisition in relation to intravenous contrast administration is critical for the optimal assessment of the extent of collaterals.","van den Wijngaard, I R; Holswilder, G; Wermer, M J H; Boiten, J; Algra, A; Dippel, D W J; Dankbaar, J W; Velthuis, B K; Boers, A M M; Majoie, C B L M; van Walderveen, M A A",AJNR.

Providers often rely on syndromic management due to prolonged test turnaround times which can result in inappropriate treatment. METHODS This study retrospectively evaluated chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment accuracy of adults, men and women, aged 18 and older in four urgent cares in Northeast Iowa, using standard NAAT in a 6-month timeframe through medical records review. Seven hundred twenty-two visits were evaluated. RESULTS 25.8% (n=186/722) of patients were treated at the time of their visit, resulting in 68.8% (n=128/186) over-treatment and 8.2% (n=44/536) under-treatment. Logistic regression analysis found that treatment prescribed without diagnostic test results and the patient-collected vaginal swabs were predictors of inappropriate treatment. Patients who were treated in the clinic were significantly less likely to be treated appropriately compared to patients who were treated later based on test results (OR 0.04, CI 0.02-0.06). Patients that self-collected vaginal swabs had significantly lower odds of being treated appropriately (OR 0.04, CI 0.09-0.80). CONCLUSION Syndromic management leads to inaccurate treatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea at the time of the initial patient visit. Changes in practice in urgent care are needed in order to improve treatment accuracy by promoting antibiotic stewardship and decreasing forward disease transmission.","Glasgow, Kimberly E",Sexually transmitted diseases,256,10

We conducted a systematic review to establish the current evidence base for the use of the AIRSEAL® insufflation device for low-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery. We searched the literature using several electronic databases, for studies with comparative design published in the English language from January 2010 to April 2020. The population of interest included patients with any type of health condition who underwent laparoscopic surgery using the AIRSEAL® insufflation system or a standard CO2 insufflator. Ten studies (four randomized clinical trials/six non-randomized clinical trials), that enrolled 1394 participants in total who underwent urology, gynaecology or abdominal surgeries, were included. Total complication rates were similar between groups. Only three studies evaluated the impact of the insufflation system on post-operative pain, and showed inconsistent benefit of AIRSEAL® (significant decrease in pain in two studies, no difference in one). The same was observed in the two sole studies in which pain killers consumption was measured (significant decrease in morphine consumption 24 h after surgery in one study, no difference in the other). Operative duration was significantly shorter with AIRSEAL® in three studies. For both post-operative room and total length of stay, there was no difference between groups. No studies reported economic outcomes. Current literature supports the feasibility of the AIRSEAL® system during laparoscopic surgery but more studies are required to establish the added clinical benefit and to explore the preferences of physicians and patients.","Balayssac, David; Selvy, Marie; Martelin, Anthony; Giroudon, Caroline; Cabelguenne, Delphine; Armoiry, Xavier",World journal of surgery,256,19

The inability to use tactile senses makes it difficult for surgeons to locate lesions during laparoscopic surgery. Endoscopic India ink marking techniques are often used in laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery. We present our experience with performing LPC with India ink during the surgical resection of various bladder lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS LPC with cystoscopic fine needle tattooing was performed on 10 patients at our institute. Tattooing was performed at 1- to 2-cm intervals approximately 1 cm away from the outer margin of the lesion with enough depth (the deep muscle layer) under cystoscopic guidance. LPC was performed by the transperitoneal approach. The clinical courses and pathologic results were analyzed. RESULTS All LPC with cystoscopic tattooing cases were performed successfully. The mean patient age was 39.1 years. The mean operative time was 130.5 minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 93 ml. The mean hospital stay was 13.1 days, and the mean duration of indwelling Foley catheterization was 10.7 days. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications except 1 case of delayed urinary leak and 1 case of delayed wound healing. The pathological diagnosis included 1 urachal cancer, 1 urachal remnant, 4 urachal cysts, 2 pheochromocytomas, and 2 inflammatory masses. All specimens showed adequate surgical margins. CONCLUSIONS Cystoscopic tattooing in LPC is a simple and effective technique to assist in locating pathological bladder lesions intraoperatively. This technique can help to determine appropriate resection margins during LPC without incurring additional complicated procedures.","Kim, Bong Ki; Song, Mi Ho; Yang, Hee Jo; Kim, Doo Sang; Lee, Nam Kyu; Jeon, Youn Soo",Korean journal of urology,256,1

Leucocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) has been reported as a regulatory factor in some chronic diseases such as hepatitis through mediating downstream target gene β-catenin. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin is also the crucial modulatory signal pathway in OD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is a kind of mesodermal stem cells; its differentiation direction is discovered affected by Wnt/β-catenin. However, the function of LECT2 in osteoporosis still remains exploration, which encourages us to lucubrate its functional effect in regulating the OD of MSCs. In this study, we found that LECT2 was expressed at low level in MSCs with osteogenic differentiation, and knockdown of LECT2 would activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway and therefore promoting OD in MSCs. It is the first time to report that LECT2 participates in regulating OD via mediating Wnt/β-catenin. Our discovery would affirmatively help provide a novel strategy for the diagnosis and therapy methods for osteoporosis.","Xu, Zhonghua; He, Jin; Zhou, Xindie; Zhang, Yi; Huang, Yong; Xu, Nanwei; Yang, Haoyu",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,256,1

In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the χ2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain.","Olivar-López, Víctor; Leyva-Barrera, Ana; López-Martínez, Briceida; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Márquez-González, Horacio",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,256,29

However, risk and clinical outcome stratification remain a great challenge. We aimed to find the potential biomarker to predict the effect of neoadjuvant CCRT on rectal cancer. METHODS We identified epiregulin (EREG) as the most significant predictive marker for neoadjuvant CCRT response from the published rectal cancer transcriptome data set GSE35452. We collected 172 biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by radical proctectomy, performed EREG immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the H-scores. We further examined the correlations between the expression level of EREG and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade, and survival, including disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS High EREG expression was significantly related to early pretreatment (pre-Tx) and posttreatment (post-Tx) tumor status (T1, T2, p = 0.047 and p < 0.001), pre-Tx and post-Tx negative nodal status (N0, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004), less vascular and perineurial invasion (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023), and higher tumor regression grade (p < 0.001). In the survival analysis, high EREG expression was significantly associated with better DSS (p < 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0004), and MeFS (p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, high EREG expression remained prognostically significant for better DSS (p = 0.003; hazard ratio: 5.599). CONCLUSION These data suggest that EREG is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic target in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT.","Lin, Cheng-Yi; Hsieh, Pei-Ling; Chou, Chia-Lin; Yang, Ching-Chieh; Lee, Sung-Wei; Tian, Yu-Feng; Shiue, Yow-Ling; Li, Wan-Shan",Oncology,256,1

Outcomes of open versus MIS segmentectomy for clinical T1, N0, M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2015) were evaluated using propensity score matching. Of the 39,351 patients who underwent surgery for stage IA NSCLC from 2010-2015, 770 underwent segmentectomy by thoracotomy and 1,056 by MIS approach (876 thoracoscopic [VATS], 180 robotic). The MIS to open conversion rate was 6.7% (n=71). After propensity-score matching, all baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the open (n=683) and MIS (n=683) groups. When compared to the open group, the MIS group had shorter median length of stay (LOS) (4 vs 5 days, p<0.001) and lower 30-day mortality (0.6% vs 1.9%, p=0.037). There were no significant differences between MIS and open groups with regard to 30-day readmission (5.0% vs 3.7%, p=0.43), or upstaging from cN0 to pN1/N2/N3 (3.1% vs 3.6%, p=0.89). The MIS approach was associated with similar long-term overall survival as the open approach (5-year survival: 62.3% vs 63.5%, p=0.89; multivariable-adjusted HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.21, p=0.96). In this national analysis of open versus MIS segmentectomy for clinical stage IA NSCLC, MIS was associated with shorter LOS and lower perioperative mortality, and similar nodal upstaging and 5-year survival when compared to segmentectomy via thoracotomy. MIS segmentectomy does not appear to compromise oncologic outcomes for clinical stage IA NSCLC.","Kumar, Arvind; Deng, John; Raman, Vignesh; Okusanya, Olugbenga; Baiu, Ioana; Berry, Mark F; D'Amico, Thomas A; Yang, Chi-Fu Jeffrey",Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,256,1

The 2 surgically transected tendon ends were reapproximated in groups 1 and 2, whereas a gap was left between the tendon ends in group 3. APD was used to reinforce the repair in group 2, and autologous PRPFM was used to fill the gap, which was also reinforced with APD, in group 3. All sheep were humanely euthanized at 24 weeks after the repair, and biomechanical and histological testing were performed. Tensile strength testing showed a statistically significant difference in elongation between the operated limb and the unoperated contralateral limb in groups 1 and 3, but not in group 2. All operated tendons appeared healed with no apparent fibrosis under light and polarized microscopy. In group 1, all surgical separation sites were identifiable, and healing occurred via increasing tendon thickness. In group 2, healing occurred with new tendon fibers across the separation, without increasing tendon thickness in 2 out of 6 animals. Group 3 showed complete bridging of the gap, with no change in tendon thickness in 2 out of 6 animals. In groups 2 and 3, peripheral integration of the APD to tendon fibers was observed. These findings support the use of APD, alone or with PRPFM, to augment Achilles tendon repair in a sheep model.","Sarrafian, Tiffany L; Wang, Hali; Hackett, Eileen S; Yao, Jian Q; Shih, Mei-Shu; Ramsay, Heather L; Turner, A Simon",The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,256,33

OBJECTIVES To analyze the initial clinical characteristics of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients on admission in order to find out which kinds may be more likely to get positive nucleic acid testing results, and to explore the risk factors associated with all-cause death. METHODS Medical records from 309 highly suspected cases with pneumonia were collected from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, in a COVID-19-designated hospital of Wuhan. The majority of the clinical data were collected on the first day of hospital admission. RESULTS Of 309 patients with median age 64 years (interquartile ranges [IQR], 53-72 years), 111 patients (35.9%) were confirmed by nucleic acid testing (median age 64 years, IQR: 56-71 years; 48 males). Of those 111 patients, 13 (11.7%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with positive testing included fatigue (odds ratios [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-5.24, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.95, p = 0.032), no less than 1 comorbidity (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06-2.98, p = 0.030), and severe pneumonia (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.20-5.97, p = 0.016). Furthermore, age, dyspnea, noneffective antibiotic treatment, white blood cell, lymphocyte, platelets, and organ dysfunction (e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly associated with all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION Patients with severe forms of this disease were more likely to get positive results.

As the sandfly vector transfers the promastigotes into the skin of the human host, the infection is either cured or exacerbated. In the process, there emerge several unsolved paradoxes of leishmaniasis. Chronologically, as the infections starts in skin, the role of the salivary proteins in supporting the infection or the host response to these proteins influencing the induction of immunological memory becomes a conundrum. As the parasite invokes inflammation, the infiltrating neutrophils may act as ""Trojan Horse"" to transfer parasites to macrophages that, along with dendritic cells, carry the parasite to lymphoid organs to start visceralization. As the visceralized infection becomes chronic, the acutely enhanced monocytopoiesis takes a downturn while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia ensue with concomitant rise in splenic colony-forming-units. These responses are accompanied by splenic and hepatic granulomas, polyclonal activation of B cells and deviation of T cell responses. The granuloma formation is both a containment process and a form of immunopathogenesis. The heterogeneity in neutrophils and macrophages contribute to both cure and progression of the disease. The differentiation of T-helper subsets presents another paradox of visceral leishmaniasis, as the counteractive T cell subsets influence the curing or non-curing outcome. Once the parasites are killed by chemotherapy, in some patients the cured visceral disease recurs as a cutaneous manifestation post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). As no experimental model exists, the natural history of PKDL remains almost a black box at the end of the visceral disease.","Saha, Baibaswata; Bhattacharjee, Surajit; Sarkar, Arup; Bhor, Renuka; Pai, Kalpana; Bodhale, Neelam",Cytokine,256,1

The purpose of this study was to clarify this relationship, while accounting for some other factors that likely influence scientific impact (e.g., the reputations of the scientists conducting the research and academic journal in which the research was published). To accomplish this purpose, approximately 800 peer-reviewed articles describing original research were evaluated for scientific impact, popular media attention, and reputations of the scientists/authors and publication venue. A structural equation model was produced describing the relationship between non-scientific impact (popular media) and scientific impact (citations), while accounting for author/scientist and journal reputation. The resulting model revealed a strong association between the amount of popular media attention given to a scientific research project and corresponding publication and the number of times that publication is cited in peer-reviewed scientific literature. These results indicate that (1) peer-reviewed scientific publications receiving more attention in non-scientific media are more likely to be cited than scientific publications receiving less popular media attention, and (2) the non-scientific media is associated with the scientific agenda. These results may inform scientists who increasingly use popular media to inform the general public and scientists concerning their scientific work.

The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4·7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4·8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1·0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Victora, Cesar G; Christian, Parul; Vidaletti, Luis Paulo; Gatica-Domínguez, Giovanna; Menon, Purnima; Black, Robert E",Lancet,256,27

Postictal suppression has been claimed to correlate with the antidepressive effectiveness of an induced seizure. Postictal suppression index (PSI) is derived from a short time span of electroencephalographic recording at seizure termination, and, alternatively, burst suppression (BS) index is defined as the percentage of suppressed epochs within a predefined time period. METHODS In a retrospective study including 9 patients with a total of 104 recorded ECT sessions, we compared the influence of variables that are known to alter seizure adequacy like age, stimulation dose, electrode position, and the number of the consecutive ECT sessions on both indices, PSI versus BS index. RESULTS For PSI, electrode positioning turned out to be a significant independent variable, with bilateral placement revealing higher PSI. Electroconvulsive therapy session number was significant for BS index, with lower burst suppression in higher ECT session number. In contrast to PSI, BS index turned out to be a significant covariate of seizure duration. Postictal suppression index and BS index did not show linear but a significant rank correlation. CONCLUSIONS We report first data about postictal BS index in ECT. As a measure of postictal electrical suppression, BS index appears as robust as PSI. Burst suppression index decreases during an individual ECT course, which presumably reflects the anticonvulsive effect of ECT. Less artifact-prone methods of automatic quantification of electrical suppression could improve precise determination of individual seizure adequacy.","Kranaster, Laura; Plum, Peter; Hoyer, Carolin; Sartorius, Alexander; Ullrich, Heiko",The journal of ECT,256,33

Distinct reaction intensities could be observed in all esophageal cell layers of the different species studied reflecting moderate to strong metabolic activities. The generally strong staining in the stratum basale indicated that new cells are continuously produced. The latter feature was confirmed by a thick, and in the horse generally highly active stratum spinosum. Only in the pig, reaction intensity variations occurred, obviously related to differences in physical feed quality or restricted feed allocation.

OBJECTIVE The aim was to explore healthcare workers' stress and influencing factors when caring for COVID-19 patients from an altruistic perspective. METHODS A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in a tertiary hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 between February and March 2020 in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China. Data were collected from 1208 healthcare workers. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Research ethics approval (with the code of TJ-IRB20200379) was obtained from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent was also received from participants. RESULTS Less than 60% of participants chose moderate or severe stress on all stressors, indicating a low stress level among healthcare workers. The main source of stress among frontline healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients came from the fear of being infected, the fear of family members being infected, and the discomfort caused by protective equipment. Frontline staff who were nurses, were married, and had worked more than 20 days suffered higher stress, whereas rescue staff showed lower stress. CONCLUSION The healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 had low stress level, although they still had the fear of being infected or uncomfortable feeling caused by personal protective equipment. A low stress level among healthcare workers indicated their professional devotion and altruism during COVID-19 epidemic. Medical institutions and the government should continue to strengthen infection prevention measures and provide more comprehensive care involving families of frontline healthcare workers, especially nurses and married staff. It will be a lesson to other countries that awaking healthcare workers' inside motivation and providing necessary support from government and society were significant.","Wang, Hui; Liu, Yu; Hu, Kaili; Zhang, Meng; Du, Meichen; Huang, Haishan; Yue, Xiao",Nursing ethics,256,4

Mechanistically, eukaryotic photosynthesis arose via a symbiotic merger between a host eukaryote and either a cyanobacterial or eukaryotic photosymbiont. There are, however, many aspects of this major evolutionary transition that remain unsettled. The field, so far, has been dominated by proposals formulated following the principle of parsimony, such as the Archaeplastida hypothesis, in which a taxonomic lineage is often conceptually recognized as an individual cell (or a distinct entity). Such an assumption could lead to confusion or unrealistic interpretation of discordant genomic and phenotypic data. Here, we propose that the free-living ancestors to the plastids may have originated from a diversified lineage of cyanobacteria that were prone to symbioses, akin to some modern-day algae such as the Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates and Chlorella-related algae that associate with a number of unrelated host eukaryotes. This scenario, which assumes the plurality of ancestral form, better explains relatively minor but important differences that are observed in the genomes of modern-day eukaryotic algal species. Such a non-typological (or population-aware) way of thinking seems to better-model empirical data, such as discordant phylogenies between plastid and host eukaryote genes.","Maruyama, Shinichiro; Kim, Eunsoo",Results and problems in cell differentiation,256,1

This work prepared a pure polylactic acid knitting mesh (PPA) and compared its structure and properties with a commercial mesh - Surgimesh® Prolapse (SP; Aspide Medical, France). Mechanical tests showed that the PPA mesh was stronger than SP with higher breaking strength and bursting strength. The in vivo property of PPA was evaluated with an animal model. Both PPA-tissue and SP-tissue were tested to have lower strength and initial elastic modulus; tissue layer played a vital role in the bio-mechanics, especially after 3 months of implantation. New tissues on the surface of PPA grew faster and thicker than that on SP at each observation period. The final shrinkage rate of PPA (2.13 ± 0.41%) was much lower than that of SP (30.35 ± 1.7%). Obvious adhesion phenomenon was observed on both PPA and SP meshes at each test point. Two meshes showed different adhesion level, that PPA was assessed of severe adhesion, even causing host tissue rupture. By histological evaluation, both PPA and SP groups showed obvious tissue inflammation reaction evidenced by rich lymphocytes. However the surrounding tissues on the PPA recovered better, with higher inflammation response scores and presence of significant vascularization and adipogenesis after six months of implantation.","Lu, Yao; Dong, Shengnan; Zhang, Peihua; Liu, Xin; Wang, Xungai",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,256,1

Coronaviruses (CoVs) carry genes that encode an nsp5 protease (also known as 3CLpro or Mpro) responsible for 11 maturation cleavages. The nsp5 structure contains two chymotrypsin-like domains (D1 and D2) and a unique domain (D3), and forms functional dimers. However, little is known of interactions or communication across the structure of the protease during nsp5 activity. Using reverse genetic mutagenesis of the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp5, we identified a new temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in D2 of nsp5 (Ser133Ala) and confirmed a ts residue in D3 (Phe219Leu). Both D2-tsS133A and D3-tsF219L were impaired for viral replication and nsp5-mediated polyprotein processing at the nonpermissive temperature. Passage of tsS133A and tsF219L at the nonpermissive temperature resulted in emergence of multiple second-site suppressor mutations, singly and in combinations. Among the second-site mutations, a D2 His134Tyr change suppressed the ts phenotype of D2-tsS133A and D3-tsF219L, as well as the previously reported D2-tsV148A. Analysis of multiple CoV nsp5 structures, and alignment of nonredundant nsp5 primary sequences, demonstrated that ts and suppressor residues are not conserved across CoVs and are physically distant (>10 Å) from each other, from catalytic and substrate-binding residues, and from the nsp5 dimer interface. These findings demonstrate that long-distance communication pathways between multiple residues and domains of nsp5 play a significant role in nsp5 activity and viral replication, suggesting possible novel targets for non-active site inhibitors of nsp5.","Stobart, Christopher C; Lee, Alice S; Lu, Xiaotao; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,256,1

The conoid, however, is believed to be heavily reduced or missing from Plasmodium species and other members of the class Aconoidasida. Relatively few conoid proteins have previously been identified, making it difficult to address how conserved this feature is throughout the phylum, and whether it is genuinely missing from some major groups. Moreover, parasites such as Plasmodium species cycle through 3 invasive forms, and there is the possibility of differential presence of the conoid between these stages. We have applied spatial proteomics and high-resolution microscopy to develop a more complete molecular inventory and understanding of the organisation of conoid-associated proteins in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. These data revealed molecular conservation of all conoid substructures throughout Apicomplexa, including Plasmodium, and even in allied Myzozoa such as Chromera and dinoflagellates. We reporter-tagged and observed the expression and location of several conoid complex proteins in the malaria model P. berghei and revealed equivalent structures in all of its zoite forms, as well as evidence of molecular differentiation between blood-stage merozoites and the ookinetes and sporozoites of the mosquito vector.

To date, no specific antiviral has proven to be of benefit for this condition. We attempted to determine the efficacy of oral ribavirin treatment for reducing early mortality among children with Japanese encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS Children (age, 6 months to 15 years) who had been hospitalized with acute febrile encephalopathy (a < or =2-week history of fever plus altered sensorium) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus with commercial immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children with positive results were randomized to receive either ribavirin (10 mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses for 7 days) or placebo syrup through nasogastric tube or by mouth. The primary outcome was early mortality; secondary outcome measures were early (at hospital discharge; normal or nearly normal, independent functioning, dependent, vegetative state, or death) outcome, time to resolution of fever, time to resumption of oral feeding, duration of hospitalization, and late outcome (> or =3 months after hospital discharge). The study was double-blind, and analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS A total of 153 patients were enrolled during a 3-year period; 70 patients received ribavirin, and 83 received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the early mortality rate: 19 (27.1%) of 70 ribavirin recipients and 21 (25.3%) of 83 placebo recipients died (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.4). No statistically significant differences in secondary outcome measures were found. CONCLUSIONS For the dosage schedule used in our study, oral ribavirin has no effect in reducing early mortality associated with Japanese encephalitis.

The discussion focusses on how a robust and explicit learning framework can be translated to the delivery of training in FEES to optimize trainee outcomes and supervisor skill. RECENT FINDINGS Specialist Speech and Language Therapists (SLT) carry out FEES to inform the diagnosis and management of swallowing and voice disorders. Taught courses are generally followed by local workplace-based supervised practice to attain the competencies identified in the relevant professional guidelines. However, the curriculum for the workplace-based FEES training lacks a learning and assessment framework and little direction for the workplace-based supervisor. In gastrointestinal endoscopy training, this previously led to less than optimal outcomes for trainees and patients and so new models of training were developed. SUMMARY A new learning framework for FEES underpinned by medical pedagogy has shown early promise in supporting the acquisition of competence. Incorporating a new FEES-specific systematic assessment, the framework provides direction for the supervisor and evidence of trainee progression, which subsequently enhances supervisor confidence to determine trainee competence.","Robinson, H Fiona",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,256,30

Indeed, social isolation stress is a major risk factor for several neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Furthermore, social isolation has a negative impact on health and fitness. However, the neurobiological consequences of long-term chronic social isolation stress (LTCSIS) manifested during the adulthood of affected individuals are not fully understood. Our study assessed the impact of LTCSIS and social buffering (re-socialization) on the behavioural performance and social-affective brain-related proteins in diurnal, social, and long-lived Octodon degus (degus). Thereby, anxiety-like and social behaviour, and social recognition memory were assessed in male and female animals subjected to a variety of stress-inducing treatments applied from post-natal and post-weaning until their adulthood. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship among LTCSIS, Oxytocin levels (OXT), and OXT-Ca2+-signalling proteins in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that LTCSIS induces anxiety like-behaviour and impairs social novelty preference whereas sociability is unaffected. On the other hand, re-socialization can revert both isolation-induced anxiety and social memory impairment. However, OXT and its signalling remained reduced in the abovementioned brain areas, suggesting that the observed changes in OXT-Ca2+ pathway proteins were permanent in male and female degus. Based on these findings, we conclude degus experience social stress differently, suggesting the existence of sex-related mechanisms to cope with specific adaptive challenges.","Rivera, Daniela S; Lindsay, Carolina B; Oliva, Carolina A; Bozinovic, Francisco; Inestrosa, Nibaldo C",Neurobiology of stress,256,1

We report emergency department (ED)-specific variables and evaluate their predictive performance on diagnosis of pneumonia, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-centre cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a Singapore tertiary hospital. Primary outcome was diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and/or death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the predictive performance of ED-specific variables. Accuracy of continuous variables was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS 294 patients were included. Patients with pneumonia were older (52.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher C-reactive protein (CRP; 33.8 mg/L, p < 0.001). Patients with indeterminate chest radiograph (CRX) findings were at risk of pneumonia vs. patients with normal CRX (37.5% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001). Patients admitted to ICU were older (60.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher CRP (40.0 mg/L, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with ICU admission and death (30.0% vs 0.39%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (aOR 1.07, p = 0.049), CRP (aOR 1.05, p = 0.006) and CRX findings (aOR 50.00, p < 0.001) had increased odds of pneumonia. ROC curve analysis showed that CRP of 23.3 mg/L was the optimal cut-off for predicting pneumonia. CONCLUSION Older age, higher CRP and CRX findings are associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, ICU admission and death. Prospective studies should be undertaken to validate these findings.","Tan, Hann-Yee; Yeo, Mathew; Tay, Xin-Ying; Fung, Michael; Kumar, Ranjeev; Ooi, Say-Tat; Amirah, Lina; Ubeynarayana, Chalani Udhyami; Mao, Desmond",Singapore medical journal,256,12

Protein precipitation as sample preparation, without the need of a time-consuming deglucuronidation step for the quantification of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, resulted in a simple and rapid assay suitable for clinical practice with a total runtime of only 1.1 min. The four components and the isotope-labeled internal standards were separated on a C18 column and detection was performed with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive ionization mode. The method was validated based on the ""Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation"" (Food and Drug Administration, FDA) and the ""Guideline on bioanalytical method validation"" of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Linearity was proven over the ranges of 5-1500 μg/L for midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam and 25-5000 μg/L for 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, using a sample volume of 100 μL. Matrix comparison indicated that the assay is also applicable to other human matrices like EDTA and heparin plasma and urine. Stability experiments showed good results for the stability of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide in serum, EDTA and heparin plasma and urine stored for 7 days under different conditions. At room temperature, 4-hydroxymidazo-lam is stable for 7 days in EDTA plasma, but stable for only 3 days in serum and heparin plasma and less than 24 h in urine. All four compounds were found to be stable in serum, EDTA plasma, heparin plasma and urine for 7 days after sample preparation and for 3 freeze-thaw cycles. The assay has been applied in therapeutic drug monitoring of midazolam for (pediatric) intensive care patients.","Wessels, A Mireille A; Bolhuis, Mathieu S; Bult, Wouter; Nijsten, Maarten W N; Kneyber, Martin C J; Touw, Daan J","Journal of chromatography.

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with metastatic BC using the National Cancer Database. To evaluate variables associated with the use of surgery at the primary site, we first used univariate tests (ie, chi-squared or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests). Subsequently, we included significant predictors in a multivariate logistic regression model. We also evaluated the impact of lumpectomy, mastectomy, or metastasectomy on overall survival (OS) by conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses on the following 3 groups: (1) all patients with stage IV disease; (2) a subset of patients with a single metastatic site; and (3) another subset of patients with metastasis to multiple distant sites. RESULTS A total of 54,871 patients with stage IV BC were included in this analysis. Variables associated with the use of surgery at the primary were: age, race, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, insurance and facility type, involved breast quadrant, receptor status, American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical N-staging, extent of metastasis, and year of diagnosis. Survival analysis showed that both lumpectomy (median OS, 45 months) and mastectomy (median OS, 44 months) were associated with better OS compared to no surgery (median OS, 22 months). The statistical effect was larger in the subgroup with metastasis to one site, but still significant in the subgroup with multiple metastatic sites. Distant site resection also yielded a survival benefit. In patients with metastasis to only one site, metastasectomy was associated with better OS when that site was the liver, lung, or brain. CONCLUSION This large retrospective study has shown potential utility of a surgical approach in metastatic breast cancer. More research, particularly with prospective trials assessing the combined benefit of primary and secondary site resection, is needed to corroborate these data.","Bilani, Nadeem; Elson, Leah; Liang, Hong; Elimimian, Elizabeth Blessing; Nahleh, Zeina",Clinical breast cancer,256,1

METHODS Five databases were searched, with two independent reviewers completing study inclusion, risk of bias, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reporting quality, and data extraction. Included studies evaluated the effect of an illusion that altered perception of the body (and/or its movement) on excitability of motor circuitry in healthy, adult, human participants. Studies were required to: use TMS to measure excitability and/or inhibition; report quantitative outcomes (e.g., motor evoked potentials); compare the illusion to a control or active comparison condition; evaluate that an illusion had occurred (e.g., measured illusion strength/presence). RESULTS Of 2,257 studies identified, 11 studies (14 experiments) were included, evaluating kinaesthetic illusions (n = 5), a rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm (n = 5), and a missing limb illusion (n = 1). Kinaesthetic illusions (induced via vision/tendon vibration) increased corticomotoneuronal excitability. Conflicting effects were found for traditional, visuotactile RHIs of a static hand. However, embodying a hand and then observing it move (""self-action"") resulted in decreased corticomotoneuronal excitability and increased silent period duration (a measure of Gamma-Aminobutynic acid [GABA]B-mediated intracortical inhibition in motor cortex), with the opposite occurring (increased excitability, decreased inhibition) when the fake hand was not embodied prior to observing movement (""other-action""). Visuomotor illusions manipulating agency had conflicting results, but in the lower risk study, illusory agency over movement resulted in a relative decrease in corticomotoneuronal excitability. Last, an illusion of a missing limb reduced corticomotoneuronal excitability. CONCLUSION While evidence for the effect of bodily illusions on corticomotoneuronal excitability was limited (only 14 experiments) and had a high risk of bias, kinaesthetic illusions and illusions of embodying a hand (and seeing it move), had consistent effects. Future investigations into the role of embodiment and the illusion strength on corticomotoneuronal excitability and inhibition are warranted.","Dilena, Alex; Todd, Gabrielle; Berryman, Carolyn; Rio, Ebonie; Stanton, Tasha R",PloS one,256,1

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of perioperative hypothermia in the setting of TKA and THA, and to evaluate its impact on complications and outcomes. The clinical records of 2580 consecutive patients who underwent TKA or THA at a single institution between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013 were reviewed. After excluding patients with complex or revision procedures, a total of 2397 patients comprised the study population. Patient demographic data, surgery-specific data, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day readmission were recorded. Patients with a mean intraoperative temperature less than 36°C were identified as hypothermic.

Most research on the effectiveness of KT strategies has focused on individual strategies, i.e., those directly targeting the modification of allied health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, for example. In general, these strategies are moderately effective in changing practices (maximum 10% change). Effecting change in organizational contexts (e.g., change readiness, general and specific organizational capacity, organizational routines) is part of a promising new avenue to service quality improvement through the implementation of evidence-based practices. The objective of this study will be to identify why, how, and under what conditions organizational KT strategies have been shown to be effective or ineffective in changing the (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, and (c) clinical behaviors of allied health professionals in traumatology settings. METHODS This is a realist review protocol involving four iterative steps: (1) Initial theory formulation, (2) search for Evidence search, (3) knowledge extraction and synthesis, and (4) recommendations. We will search electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, Cochrane Library, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. The studies included will be those relating to the use of organizational KT strategies in trauma settings, regardless of study designs, published between January 1990 and October 2020, and presenting objective measures that demonstrate change in allied health professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and clinical behaviors.

Here we investigate sex-based differences in the molecular mechanisms of anticancer immune-response and immune evasion in patients with NSCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We analyzed a) transcriptome-data of 2575 early-stage NSCLCs from 7 different datasets; b) 327 tumor-samples extensively characterized at the molecular level from the TRACERx lung study; c) two independent cohorts of respectively 329 and 391 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 drugs. RESULTS As compared with men, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of women was significantly enriched for a number of innate and adaptive immune cell-types, including specific T-cell subpopulations. NSCLCs of men and women exploited different mechanisms of immune evasion. The TME of females was characterized by significantly greater T-cell dysfunction status, higher expression of inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecules and higher abundance of immune-suppressive cells, including Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, MDSCs and Regulatory T-cells. By contrast, the TME of males was significantly enriched for a T-cells excluded phenotype. We reported data supporting impaired neoantigens presentation to immune system in tumors of men, as molecular mechanism explaining the findings observed. Finally, in line with our results, we showed significant sex-based differences in the association between TMB and outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated meaningful sex-based differences of anticancer immune response and immune evasion mechanisms, that may be exploited to improve immunotherapy efficacy for both women and men.","Conforti, Fabio; Pala, Laura; Pagan, Eleonora; Bagnardi, Vincenzo; De Pas, Tommaso; Queirolo, Paola; Pennacchioli, Elisabetta; Catania, Chiara; Cocorocchio, Emilia; Ferrucci, Pier Francesco; Saponara, Maristella; Orsolini, Gianmarco; Zagami, Paola; Nicolo, Eleonora; De Marinis, Filippo; Tortora, Giampaolo; Bria, Emilio; Minucci, Saverio; Joffe, Hadine; Veronesi, Paolo; Wargo, Jennifer A; Rosenthal, Rachel; Swanton, Charles; Mantovani, Alberto; Gelber, Richard D; Viale, Giuseppe; Goldhirsch, Aron; Giaccone, Giuseppe",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,256,1

In a surveillance study involving 1,472 samples from 368 dogs over a 22-month period, we identified a novel picornavirus-like virus from 47 fecal and urine samples by the use of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of three complete genomes revealed that, although it seemed that the virus was most closely related to other picornaviruses, P1, P2, and P3 of the virus possessed very low amino acid identities of <30% to those of all other known picornaviruses and that the amino acid identities between the 3D(pol) and 2C of the virus and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and helicases of all other picornaviruses were <35%. Distinct from other picornaviruses, the genomes of the virus contain two putative internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and two open reading frames, encoding two polyprotein precursors (844 and 1,406 amino acids), separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of 588 bases. A dual-luciferase activity assay using DNA and RNA transfection revealed that both IRESs were functional. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that numbers of viral RNAs ranged from 7.55 × 10(6) to 1.26 × 10(9) copies/ml of urine and 1.82 × 10(6) to 4.97 × 10(10) copies/ml of fecal sample. This is the first report of the natural occurrence of two functional IRESs in nondicistroviruses. Based on our results, we have proposed a novel species, canine picodicistrovirus (CPDV), to describe this novel member of the picornavirus-like superfamily, which could represent a novel family of viruses.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Choi, Garnet K Y; Huang, Yi; Teng, Jade L L; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Tse, Herman; Yeung, Man Lung; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,256,29

Such quantitative approaches are expected to facilitate the selection on which compound to prioritize for successful development, predict the human efficacious dose based on preclinical data with adequate precision, guide design and de-risk later development stages. The importance of time-dependencies, which are typically species-dependent due to different turnover rates of biological processes, is however often neglected. For bacterial infections, the choice of dosing regimen is typically relying on preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, since the bacterial load and disease severity, and consequently the PKPD-relationship, cannot be quantified well on clinical data, given the low-information endpoints used. It is time to recognize the limitations of using time-collapsed approaches for translation, i.e. methods where targets are based on summary measures of exposure and response. Models describing the full time-course captures important quantitative information of drug distribution, bacterial growth, antibiotic killing and resistance development, and can account for species-differences in the PK profiles driving the killing. Furthermore, with a model-based approach for translation, we can take a holistic approach in development of a joint model for in vitro, in vivo and clinical data, as well as incorporating information on the contribution of the immune system. Such advancements are anticipated to facilitate rational decision making during various stages of drug development and in the optimization of treatment regimens for different groups of patients.","Friberg, Lena E",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,256,31

To identify R. solanacearum effectors that suppress effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants, we evaluated R. solanacearum RS1000 effectors for their ability to suppress a hypersensitive response (HR) induced by the avirulence (Avr) effector RipAA in Nicotiana benthamiana. Out of the 11 effectors tested, four suppressed RipAA-triggered HR cell death. Among them, RipAC contains tandem repeats of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif, which serves as the structural scaffold for a protein-protein interaction. We found that the LRR domain of RipAC was indispensable for the suppression of HR cell death during the recognition of RipAA and another Avr effector RipP1. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified N. benthamiana SGT1, an adaptor protein that forms a molecular chaperone complex with RAR1, as a host factor of the RipAC target. RipAC interacted with NbSGT1 in yeast and plant cells. Upon the formation of the molecular chaperone complex, the presence of RipAC markedly inhibits the interaction between NbSGT1 and NbRAR1. The RipAA- and RipP1-triggered HR cell death were not observed in NbSGT1-silenced plants. The introduction of RipAC was complementary to the reduced growth of the R. solanacearum mutant strain in N. benthamiana. These findings indicate that R. solanacearum uses RipAC to subvert the NbSGT1-mediated formation of the molecular chaperone complex and suppress ETI responses during the recognition of Avr effectors.","Nakano, Masahito; Ichinose, Yuki; Mukaihara, Takafumi",Plant & cell physiology,256,23

The clinical data and virological findings were reported from patients. Additional review of recently recorded fatal patients with adenovirus infection was carried out. RESULTS The patients presented with sudden onset respiratory distress that progressed rapidly to respiratory failure and death. Human adenovirus (HAdV)-55 was detected in both nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum samples in all three cases, and moreover detected in lung, liver, and kidney in one case. In another case, remarkably elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase were identified. Three HAdV-55 strains were isolated and genome sequencing revealed a high similarity with other strains from mild infection. CONCLUSIONS Fatal infection with HAdv-55 might occur in otherwise healthy adults. Diagnosis of adenovirus infection should be considered in patients with severe pneumonia yielding negative bacterial culture and presenting no response to antibiotic therapy.","Zhang, Shu-Yan; Luo, Yan-Ping; Huang, Dou-Dou; Fan, Hang; Lu, Qing-Bin; Wo, Ying; Chen, Gang; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Li, Yan; Tong, Yi-Gang; Cao, Wu-Chun; Liu, Wei",Infectious diseases,256,26

However, whether a neutralizing antibody could have the breadth of range to target different viral species was unknown. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are common pathogens that cause severe disease in premature newborns, hospitalized children and immune-compromised patients, and play a role in asthma exacerbations. Although antisera generated against either HRSV or HMPV are not cross-neutralizing, we speculated that, because of the repeated exposure to these viruses, cross-neutralizing antibodies may be selected in some individuals. Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody (MPE8) that potently cross-neutralizes HRSV and HMPV as well as two animal paramyxoviruses: bovine RSV (BRSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). In its germline configuration, MPE8 is HRSV-specific and its breadth is achieved by somatic mutations in the light chain variable region. MPE8 did not result in the selection of viral escape mutants that evaded antibody targeting and showed potent prophylactic efficacy in animal models of HRSV and HMPV infection, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the more relevant model of lethal PVM infection. The core epitope of MPE8 was mapped on two highly conserved anti-parallel β-strands on the pre-fusion viral F protein, which are rearranged in the post-fusion F protein conformation. Twenty-six out of the thirty HRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies isolated were also found to be specific for the pre-fusion F protein. Taken together, these results indicate that MPE8 might be used for the prophylaxis and therapy of severe HRSV and HMPV infections and identify the pre-fusion F protein as a candidate HRSV vaccine.","Corti, Davide; Bianchi, Siro; Vanzetta, Fabrizia; Minola, Andrea; Perez, Laurent; Agatic, Gloria; Guarino, Barbara; Silacci, Chiara; Marcandalli, Jessica; Marsland, Benjamin J; Piralla, Antonio; Percivalle, Elena; Sallusto, Federica; Baldanti, Fausto; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Nature,256,1

Herein, we employed accurate mass/high resolution mass spectrometry to demonstrate that the active site serine (S465) and C651 of iPLA2β are covalently cross-linked during incubations with BEL demonstrating their close spatial proximity. This cross-link results in macroscopic alterations in enzyme molecular geometry evidenced by anomalous migration of the cross-linked enzyme by SDS-PAGE. Molecular models of iPLA2β constructed from the crystal structure of iPLA2α (patatin) indicate that the distance between S465 and C651 is approximately 10 Å within the active site of iPLA2β. Kinetic analysis of the formation of the 75 kDa iPLA2β-BEL species with the (R) and (S) enantiomers of BEL demonstrated that the reaction of (S)-BEL with iPLA2β was more rapid than for (R)-BEL paralleling the enantioselectivity for the inhibition of catalysis by each inhibitor with iPLA2β. Moreover, we demonstrate that the previously identified selective acylation of iPLA2β by oleoyl-CoA occurs at C651 thereby indicating the importance of active site architecture for acylation of this enzyme. Collectively, these results identify C651 as a highly reactive nucleophilic residue within the active site of iPLA2β which is thioesterified by BEL, acylated by oleoyl-CoA, and located in close spatial proximity to the catalytic serine thereby providing important chemical insights on the mechanisms through which BEL inhibits iPLA2β and the topology of the active site.","Jenkins, Christopher M; Yang, Jingyue; Gross, Richard W",Biochemistry,256,2

Surgery aims to improve QoL with a minimum risk of further complications. The aim was to analyze QoL, predictors for outcome, including recurrence and reoperation rates during the first postoperative year. METHODS In a randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic and open mesh repair, 133 patients were assessed preoperatively and after 1 year with regard to QoL using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), visual analog scale (pain, movement limitation, and fatigue), and questions addressing abdominal wall complaints. Factors concerning recurrence, reoperations, satisfaction, and improved QoL were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 124 patients remained for analysis. All SF-36 scores except mental composite score increased, reaching and maintaining levels of the Swedish norm already after 8 weeks with no difference between groups. Event-free recovery was seen in 85% in the laparoscopic group and in 65% of the open cases (P < 0.010). Five recurrences occurred after laparoscopic surgery and 1 in the open group (P < 0.112). Overall, abdominal wall complaints decreased from 82% to 13% of the patients; and 92% were satisfied with the result after 1 year.In univariable logistic regression analyses laparoscopic surgery and male sex predicted an event-free recovery. Obesity (BMI > 30) predicted better outcome with regard to QoL. No predictors for recurrence or satisfaction were identified. CONCLUSIONS Patients with incisional hernia benefit substantially from surgery concerning QoL, independent of surgical technique. An event-free recovery occurred frequently after laparoscopic surgery. SF-36 seems well suited for assessing surgical outcome in patients after incisional hernia repair.","Rogmark, Peder; Petersson, Ulf; Bringman, Sven; Ezra, Emmanuel; Österberg, Johanna; Montgomery, Agneta",Annals of surgery,256,1

We show here that formation of sfRNA also inhibits XRN1 activity. Cells infected with Dengue or Kunjin viruses accumulate uncapped mRNAs, decay intermediates normally targeted by XRN1. XRN1 repression also resulted in the increased overall stability of cellular mRNAs in flavivirus-infected cells. Importantly, a mutant Kunjin virus that cannot form sfRNA but replicates to normal levels failed to affect host mRNA stability or XRN1 activity. Expression of sfRNA in the absence of viral infection demonstrated that sfRNA formation was directly responsible for the stabilization of cellular mRNAs. Finally, numerous cellular mRNAs were differentially expressed in an sfRNA-dependent fashion in a Kunjin virus infection. We conclude that flaviviruses incapacitate XRN1 during infection and dysregulate host mRNA stability as a result of sfRNA formation.","Moon, Stephanie L; Anderson, John R; Kumagai, Yutaro; Wilusz, Carol J; Akira, Shizuo; Khromykh, Alexander A; Wilusz, Jeffrey",RNA,256,1

We compared the clinical outcome of infections caused by different respiratory viruses (RVs) and by RV coinfection in this population. METHODS Children with cancer and FN at 3 hospitals in Chile were prospectively evaluated by clinical examination, blood cultures and detection of 17 RVs using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (nasopharyngeal samples). Clinical characterization and outcome variables were determined and compared by the type of RV detected. RESULTS A total of 1044 episodes of FN in 525 children were included. At least 1 RV was detected in 46%. In 350 of 1044 (34%) episodes, we detected only RVs, of which 284 (81%) were classified as a single-RV infection and 66 (19%) as a viral coinfection. Respiratory symptoms were present at admission in 65% of the episodes with any detected RV. Median age was 6 years (interquartile range, 3-10), and 51% were women. The most common RVs detected were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus. Episodes caused by different types of RVs had no differences in the clinical outcome (days of hospitalization, days of fever, O2 requirement, admission to the intensive care unit and death) and when comparing single and viral coinfection. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the largest report comparing clinical outcome in FN episodes caused by different RVs in children with cancer.

One imaging characteristic considered in selecting patients who may benefit from MRgFUS of their uterine fibroids is the signal intensity of the fibroid compared with surrounding myometrium on T2-weighted MR images. Previous reports suggest that hyper-intense fibroids are less amenable to MRgFUS compared with iso- or hypo-intense fibroids. In this case study, we utilized contrast-enhanced dynamic MR imaging to further characterize the vascularity of a hyper-intense fibroid. Based on the results of dynamic T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images, we assumed that the hyper-intense appearance resulted from high fluid content rather than high vascularity and predicted that the fibroid would respond to MRgFUS. The patient underwent the MRgFUS without complication and reported significant decrease in fibroid symptoms at 3 and 12 months post-treatment. This case suggests that pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging used in conjunction with T2-weighted imaging may improve the criteria for selecting uterine fibroids amenable to treatment with MRgFUS, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.","Yoon, Sang-Wook; Lee, Chan; Kim, Kyoung Ah; Kim, Sang Heum",Obstetrics and gynecology international,256,25

The present study assessed cooling capacities (C; W·h·m-2) of various commercially available vests using different cooling concepts. Measurements were conducted over 8 h in a climatic chamber (Ta: 35 ˚C, RH: 35%) using a thermal manikin (Ts: 35 ˚C). Cooling power (P) and duration of efficient cooling (tc) determined the C value of each vest. Among the cooling concepts the active cooling vests were the most efficient, extracting 331 W·h·m-2, followed by the vests with phase change material (PCM) inserts, hybrid and evaporative vests, extracting a maximum of 164 W·h·m-2, 146 W·h·m-2 and 113 W·h·m-2, respectively. While some vests with PCM inserts provided intense but shorter cooling, evaporative vests provided mild but longer cooling throughout. Practitioner summary: The study assessed the cooling capacity of commercially available vests, using a thermal manikin. The vests present an affordable solution in various occupational settings where air-conditioning is not an option.

METHODS We queried the 2002-2016 National Inpatient Sample database for hospitalized patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. We report temporal trends, predictors, and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting in the early (2002-2010) and recent (2011-2016) cohorts. RESULTS Of 3,347,470 patients hospitalized for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 7.7% underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. The incidence of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction decreased over time (9.2% in 2002 vs 5.5% in 2016, Ptrend < .001), whereas perioperative crude in-hospital mortality did not change (5.1% in 2002 vs 4.2% in 2016, Ptrend = .66), coinciding with an increase in the burden of comorbidities. There was an increase in performing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on hospitalization day 3 or more, as well as an increase in the use of mechanical support devices and precoronary artery bypass grafting percutaneous coronary intervention. In the early cohort, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on days 1 and 2 was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. In the recent cohort, coronary artery bypass grafting on day 2 had similar in-hospital mortality compared with day 3 or more and lower rates of acute kidney injury, ischemic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide analysis, there has been a decline in the use of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on day 1 was performed in sicker patients and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than coronary artery bypass grafting performed on day 3 or more. In the recent cohort, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on day 2 had similar in-hospital mortality compared with day 3 or more.","Elbadawi, Ayman; Elzeneini, Mohammed; Elgendy, Islam Y; Megaly, Michael; Omer, Mohamed; Jimenez, Ernesto; Ghanta, Ravi K; Brilakis, Emmanouil S; Jneid, Hani",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,256,5

According to the anatomy of the tibial nerve, ankle dorsiflexion and eversion movements could be used to perform the tibial neurodynamic test (TNT). To date, no study has documented the normal responses of the TNT. OBJECTIVE To document normal responses of the TNT in asymptomatic individuals and to investigate influences from sex and leg dominance. METHODS A cross-sectional study with 44 asymptomatic volunteer subjects, a total of 88 lower limbs, was carried out. The range of motion (ROM), quality, and distribution of sensory responses were recorded. The hip flexion ROM was measured when subjects reported an intensity of their symptoms of 2/10 (P1) and 8/10 (P2). RESULTS The mean ROM for hip flexion at P1 was 44.22 ± 13.13∘ and 66.73 ± 14.30∘ at P2. Hip flexion was significantly greater at P2 than P1 (p< 0.001). However, it was not different between sex or limbs (p> 0.05). The descriptor of the quality of sensory responses most often used by participants was stretching (88.6% and 87.5% for P1 and P2, respectively) in the popliteal fossa and posterior calf. CONCLUSIONS This study describes the sensory responses of asymptomatic subjects resulting from the TNT. Our findings indicate that TNT responses are independent of the influence of sex or leg dominance.","Bueno-Gracia, Elena; Malo-Urriés, Miguel; Montaner-Cuello, Alberto; Borrella-Andrés, Sergio; López-de-Celis, Carlos",Journal of back and musculoskeletal rehabilitation,256,1

We aimed to assess the accuracy of flat panel detector CT in detecting/excluding intracranial bleeding after endovascular stroke therapy and whether it was able to reliably differentiate hemorrhage from early blood-brain barrier disruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-three patients were included for retrospective evaluation following endovascular stroke therapy: 32 after stent-assisted thrombectomy, 14 after intra-arterial thrombolysis, and 27 after a combination of both. Flat panel CT images were assessed for image quality and the presence and type of intracranial hemorrhage and BBB disruption by 2 readers separately and in consensus. Follow-up by multisection head CT, serving as the reference standard, was evaluated by a single reader. RESULTS Conventional head CT revealed intracranial hematomas in 12 patients (8 subarachnoid hemorrhages, 7 cases of intracerebral bleeding, 3 SAHs plus intracerebral bleeding). Image quality of flat panel detector CT was considered sufficient in all cases supratentorially and in 92% in the posterior fossa. Regarding detection or exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage, flat panel detector CT reached a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of 58%, 85%, 44%, 91%, and 81%, respectively. Maximum attenuation measurements were not valuable for the differentiation of hemorrhage and BBB disruption. CONCLUSIONS Flat panel CT after endovascular stroke treatment was able to exclude the rare event of an intracranial hemorrhage with a high negative predictive value. Future studies should evaluate the predictive value of BBB disruptions in flat panel detector CT for the development of relevant hematomas.","Kau, T; Hauser, M; Obmann, S M; Niedermayer, M; Weber, J R; Hausegger, K A",AJNR.

Although thermal tactile oral stimulation is a common method to treat dysphagic patients to improve swallowing movement, little is known about the possible mechanisms. This study is aimed to investigate whether thermal oral (tongue) stimulation can modulate the cortico-pharyngeal neural motor pathway in humans. METHODS Eighteen healthy volunteers participated and were intubated with an intraluminal catheter for recording pharyngeal electromyography. Each participant underwent baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) cortico-pharyngeal motor evoked potential (MEP) measurements bilaterally. MEPs were then measured during thermal stimulation over the dorsal tongue, applied using the Peltier device at three different temperatures; 45°C, 37°C, and 15°C, in a pre-ordered manner. Each of the three temperatures was given twice with a 5-min resting time between each trial. Averaged MEP amplitude changes were analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. KEY RESULTS Two-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors of Temperature × Trial in amplitude of MEP demonstrated a significant effect of Temperature both in the stronger (F2,34 = 5.775, P = .007) and weaker (F2,34 = 4.771, P = .017) pharyngeal hemispheres. Subsequent post-hoc tests showed the significant increase in pharyngeal MEPs at 15° compared to 37° in both hemispheres (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Cold oral stimulation was able to induce significant changes in pharyngeal cortical excitability, demonstrating evidence for a sensorimotor interaction between oral and pharyngeal cortical areas.","Magara, J; Watanabe, M; Tsujimura, T; Hamdy, S; Inoue, M",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,256,5

Recent methodological advances have revealed functional magnetic resonance imaging-like connectivity networks using electroencephalography (EEG), a tool more easily implemented in clinical practice. Objective To determine whether EEG connectivity could reveal neural moderators of antidepressant treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this nonprespecified secondary analysis, data were analyzed from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinic Care study, a placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruitment began July 29, 2011, and was completed December 15, 2015. A random sample of 221 outpatients with depression aged 18 to 65 years who were not taking medication for depression was recruited and assessed at 4 clinical sites. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis was performed from November 16, 2018, to May 23, 2019. Interventions Patients received either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride or placebo for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Electroencephalographic orthogonalized power envelope connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state EEG data. Intent-to-treat prediction linear mixed models were used to determine which pretreatment connectivity patterns were associated with response to sertraline vs placebo. The primary clinical outcome was the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, administered at each study visit. Results Of the participants recruited, 9 withdrew after first dose owing to reported adverse effects, and 221 participants (150 women; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.7] years) underwent EEG recordings and had high-quality pretreatment EEG data. After correction for multiple comparisons, connectome-wide analyses revealed moderation by connections within and between widespread cortical regions-most prominently parietal-for both the antidepressant and placebo groups. Greater alpha-band and lower gamma-band connectivity predicted better placebo outcomes and worse antidepressant outcomes. Lower connectivity levels in these moderating connections were associated with higher levels of anhedonia. Connectivity features that moderate treatment response differentially by treatment group were distinct from connectivity features that change from baseline to 1 week into treatment. The group mean (SD) score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was 18.35 (4.58) at baseline and 26.14 (30.37) across all time points. Conclusions and Relevance These findings establish the utility of EEG-based network functional connectivity analyses for differentiating between responses to an antidepressant vs placebo. A role emerged for parietal cortical regions in predicting placebo outcome. From a treatment perspective, capitalizing on the therapeutic components leading to placebo response differentially from antidepressant response should provide an alternative direction toward establishing a placebo signature in clinical trials, thereby enhancing the signal detection in randomized clinical trials.

These changes have been attributed to unusually low traffic volume during the stay-at-home period. We develop a novel theoretical account, based on existing empirical research, of perceptual and psychological processes that may account for changes in speeding behavior under low traffic volume conditions. These include impaired ability to accurately perceive and control speed due to change in visual information, decreased salience of certain norms about socially appropriate speeds, lower perceived risk of speeding, and increased boredom leading to risk-taking behaviors. Further, we consider that individual attitude functions may account for the observed split in speeding behavior.","Tucker, A; Marsh, K L",Accident; analysis and prevention,256,17

We measured exposure contrasts for women, achievable under alternative conditions of biomass or LPG cookfuel use, at potential HAPIN field sites in India, to aid in site selection for the main trial. METHODS We recruited participants from potential field sites within Villupuram and Nagapattinam districts in Tamil Nadu, India, that were identified during a feasibility assessment. We performed. (i) cross-sectional measurements on women (N = 79) using either biomass or LPG as their primary cookfuel and (ii) before-and-after measurements on pregnant women (N = 41), once at baseline while using biomass fuel and twice - at 1 and 2 months - after installation of an LPG stove and free fuel intervention. We involved participants to co-design clothing and instrument stands for personal and area sampling. We measured 24 or 48-h personal exposures and kitchen and ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using gravimetric samplers. RESULTS In the cross-sectional analysis, median (interquartile range, IQR) kitchen PM2.5 concentrations in biomass and LPG using homes were 134 μg/m3 [IQR:71-258] and 27 μg/m3 [IQR:20-47], while corresponding personal exposures were 75 μg/m3 [IQR:55-104] and 36 μg/m3 [IQR:26-46], respectively. In before-and-after analysis, median 48-h personal exposures for pregnant women were 72 μg/m3 [IQR:49-127] at baseline and 25 μg/m3 [IQR:18-35] after the LPG intervention, with a sustained reduction of 93% in mean kitchen PM2.5 concentrations and 78% in mean personal PM2.5 exposures over the 2 month intervention period. Median ambient concentrations were 23 μg/m3 [IQR:19-27). Participant feedback was critical in designing clothing and instrument stands that ensured high compliance. CONCLUSIONS An LPG stove and fuel intervention in the candidate HAPIN trial field sites in India was deemed suitable for achieving health-relevant exposure reductions. Ambient concentrations indicated limited contributions from other sources. Study results provide critical inputs for the HAPIN trial site selection in India, while also contributing new information on HAP exposures in relation to LPG interventions and among pregnant women in LMICs.

We compared the characteristics and outcomes of children 0-59 months of age who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza or RSV between 2009 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. METHODS We included hospitalized children who were tested for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, and were positive for a single virus. We characterized individuals by their demographics and healthcare utilization patterns, and compared their hospital outcomes, in-hospital cost, and post-discharge healthcare use by virus type and by presence of underlying comorbidities. RESULTS We identified and analyzed 7,659 hospitalizations during which a specimen tested positive for influenza or RSV. Children with RSV were the youngest whereas children with influenza B were the oldest (median ages 6 months [interquartile range {IQR}: 2-17 months] and 25 months [IQR: 10-45 months], respectively). Complex chronic conditions were more prevalent among children with all influenza (sub)types than RSV (31%-34% vs 20%). In-hospital outcomes were similar by virus type, but in children with comorbidities, post-discharge outcomes varied. We observed no differences in in-hospital cost between viruses or by presence of comorbidities (overall median cost: $4,150 CAD [IQR: $3,710-$4,948]).

We have previously shown that mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunomodulator, has antiviral activity against influenza A/WSN/1933(H1N1) using a high-throughput chemical screening assay. This study further investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of MPA against contemporary clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses. The 50 % cellular cytotoxicity (CC50) of MPA in Madin Darby canine kidney cell line was over 50 µM. MPA prevented influenza virus-induced cell death in the cell-protection assay, with significantly lower IC50 for influenza B virus B/411 than that of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus H1/415 (0.208 vs 1.510 µM, P=0.0001). For H1/415, MPA interfered with the early stage of viral replication before protein synthesis. For B/411, MPA may also act at a later stage since MPA was active against B/411 even when added 12 h post-infection. Virus-yield reduction assay showed that the replication of B/411 was completely inhibited by MPA at concentrations ≥0.78 µM, while there was a dose-dependent reduction of viral titer for H1/415. The antiviral effect of MPA was completely reverted by guanosine supplementation. Plaque reduction assay showed that MPA had antiviral activity against eight different clinical isolates of A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H7N9) and influenza B viruses (IC50 <1 µM). In summary, MPA has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against human and avian-origin influenza viruses, in addition to its immunomodulatory activity. Together with a high chemotherapeutic index, the use of MPA as an antiviral agent should be further investigated in vivo.","To, Kelvin K W; Mok, Ka-Yi; Chan, Andy S F; Cheung, Nam N; Wang, Pui; Lui, Yin-Ming; Chan, Jasper F W; Chen, Honglin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Kao, Richard Y T; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,256,31

CT of the chest can verify the infection in patients with clinical symptoms and a negative test result accelerating treatment and actions to prevent further contagion. However, CT employs ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate protocol settings, associated radiation exposure, image quality and diagnostic performance of a low-dose CT protocol in a university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest-CT examinations were performed on a single scanner (Somatom Definition Edge, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) in 105 symptomatic patients (60 male, 45 female). Images were evaluated with regard to protocol parameters, image quality, radiation exposure and diagnostic accuracy. Serial RT-PCR served as the standard of reference. Based on this reference standard sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CT with 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS The mean effective dose was 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv (0.7 - 2.9 mSv) for the patient cohort (mean age 66.6 ± 16.7 years (19-94 years), mean BMI 26.6 ± 5.3 kg/m² (16-46 kg/m²)). A sensitivity of 100 [95% CI: 82-100]%, a specificity of 78 [95% CI: 68-86]%, a positive predictive value of 50 [95% CI: 33-67]% and a negative predictive value of 100 [95% CI: 95-100]% were obtained. No COVID-19 diagnoses were missed by CT. Image noise did not strongly correlate with BMI or patient diameter and was rated as average. CONCLUSIONS We presented a robust imaging procedure with a chest CT protocol for confident diagnosis of COVID-19. Even for an overweight patient cohort, an associated radiation exposure of only 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv was achieved with sufficient diagnostic quality to exclude COVID-19.","Steuwe, Andrea; Rademacher, Christin; Valentin, Birte; Koehler, Marie-Helen; Appel, Elisabeth; Keitel, Verena; Timm, Joerg; Antoch, Gerald; Aissa, Joel",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,256,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sentinel lymph node detection was performed prospectively over a 6-year period in 86 women undergoing surgery for cervical carcinoma by the combined method (Tc-99m and methylene blue dye). Further ultrastaging was performed on a subgroup of 26 patients who had benign SLNs on initial routine histological examination. RESULTS The SLN was detected in 84 (97.7%) of 86 women by the combined method. Blue dye uptake was not seen in 8 women (90.7%). Sentinel lymph nodes were detected bilaterally in 63 women (73.3%), and the external iliac region was the most common anatomic location (48.8%). The median SLN count was 3 nodes (range, 1-7). Of the 84 women with sentinel node detection, 65 also underwent bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and in none of these cases was a benign SLN associated with a malignant non-SLN (100% negative predictive value). The median non-SLN count for all patients was 19 nodes (range, 8-35). Eighteen patients underwent removal of the SLN without bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Nine women (10.5%) had positive lymph nodes on final histology. One patient had bulky pelvic nodes on preoperative imaging and underwent removal of the negative bulky malignant lymph nodes and a benign SLN on the contralateral side. This latter case confirms the unreliability of the SLN method with bulky nodes. The remaining 8 patients had positive SLNs with negative nonsentinel lymph nodes. Fifty-nine SLNs from 26 patients, which were benign on initial routine histology, underwent ultrastaging, but no further disease was identified. Four patients (5%) relapsed after a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 8-80 months). CONCLUSION Sentinel lymph node detection is an accurate and safe method in the assessment of nodal status in early cervical carcinoma.","Devaja, Omer; Mehra, Gautam; Coutts, Michael; Montalto, Stephen Attard; Donaldson, John; Kodampur, Mallikarjun; Papadopoulos, Andreas John",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,256,6

Incidence rates vary internationally, with the highest rates found in Southern and Eastern Africa, and central Asia. Initial observational studies identified multiple factors associated with an increased risk of ESCC, with subsequent work then focused on developing plausible biological mechanistic associations. The aim of this review is to summarize the role of risk factors in the development of ESCC and propose future directions for further research. A systematic search of the literature was conducted by screening EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, and CENTRAL for relevant publications. In total, 73 studies were included that sought to identify risk factors associated with the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Risk factors were divided into seven subcategories: genetic, dietary and nutrition, gastric atrophy, infection and microbiome, metabolic, epidemiological and environmental and other risk factors. Risk factors from each subcategory were summarized and explored with mechanistic explanations for these associations. This review highlights several current risk factors of ESCC. These risk factors were explored, and explanations dissected. Most studies focused on investigating genetic and dietary and nutritional factors, whereas this review identified other potential risk factors that have yet to be fully explored. Furthermore, there is a lack of literature on the association of these risk factors with tumor factors and disease prognosis. Further research to validate these results and their effects on tumor biology is absolutely necessary.","Tarazi, Munir; Chidambaram, Swathikan; Markar, Sheraz R",Cancers,256,19

METHODS Three hundred patients undergoing elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation were enrolled. Patients presented at least one or more risk factors for difficult airway. The patients were randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: group L, FOI with tongue root holder, or group C, standard FOI. Orotracheal FOI was performed after commencement of anesthesia. The jaw thrust maneuver was applied in both groups to facilitate advancement of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of FOI. The secondary endpoints were number of attempts, time to intubation, and airway clearance at the soft palate and epiglottis levels. RESULTS The FOI was achieved in all 150 patients in group L, significantly higher than that in group C (100% vs 95.3%; P = 0.015). Less attempts of intubation were made in group L (P = 0.039). Mean time to successful intubation on the first attempt was shorter in group L (P < 0.001). The mean times to view the vocal cord and carina were also shorter in group L (P = 0.011 and P < 0.001, respectively). Airway clearance was better in group L at both the soft palate and the glottis levels (P = 0.010 and P = 0.038, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that FOI is feasible with the newly introduced, self-designed, ""tongue root holder"" device, when combined with the jaw thrust maneuver in patients with risk factors for difficult airway. The device also provides better airway clearance, less intubation attempts, and shorter time to intubation at first attempt. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Fiberoptic bronchoscope has been the gold standard for routine management of difficult airway. A technique to open the airway is introduced to reduce the incidence rate of upper airway obstruction.","Cao, Xiaofei; Wu, Junbei; Fang, Yin; Ding, Zhengnian; Qi, Tao",Clinical oral investigations,256,33

It is not known if the THRIVE score predicts outcomes with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. AIMS To validate the relationship between the THRIVE score and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire endovascular stroke treatment device. METHODS The study conducted a retrospective analysis of the prospective SWIFT and STAR trials to examine the relationship between THRIVE and outcomes after treatment with the Solitaire device. We examined the relationship between THRIVE and clinical outcomes (good outcome or death at 90 days) among patients in SWIFT and STAR. Receiver-operator characteristics curve analysis was used to compare THRIVE score performance with other stroke prediction scores. Multivariable modeling was used to confirm the independence of the THRIVE score from procedure-specific predictors (successful recanalization or device used) and other predictors of functional outcome. RESULTS The THRIVE score strongly predicts good outcome and death among patients treated with the Solitaire device in SWIFT and STAR (Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for trend P < 0·001 for good outcome, P = 0·01 for death). In receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve comparisons, totaled health risks in vascular events score is superior to Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale score-100 (P < 0·001) and performed similarly to Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy score (HIAT) (P = 0·98) and HIAT-2 (P = 0·54). In multivariable models, THRIVE's prediction of good outcome is not altered after controlling for recanalization or after controlling for device used. The THRIVE score remains a strong independent predictor after controlling for the above predictors together with time to procedure, rate of symptomatic haemorrhage, and use of general anesthesia. Of note, use of general anesthesia was not an independent predictor of outcome in SWIFT + STAR after controlling for totaled health risks in vascular events and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The THRIVE score strongly predicts clinical outcome and mortality in patients treated with the Solitaire device in the SWIFT and STAR trials. The lack of interaction between THRIVE and procedure-specific elements such as vessel recanalization or device choice makes the THRIVE score a reasonable candidate for use as a patient selection criterion in stroke clinical trials.","Flint, Alexander C; Cullen, Sean P; Rao, Vivek A; Faigeles, Bonnie S; Pereira, Vitor M; Levy, Elad I; Jovin, Tudor G; Liebeskind, David S; Nogueira, Raul G; Jahan, Reza; Saver, Jeffrey L",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,256,24

In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. Observations Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients' well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. Conclusions and Relevance Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","de Girolamo, Giovanni; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Clerici, Massimo; Monzani, Emiliano; Spinogatti, Franco; Starace, Fabrizio; Tura, Giambattista; Vita, Antonio",JAMA psychiatry,256,20

Treatments that directly address tumor survival are required. Indomethacin (IND) is a well-known drug used worldwide. Although widely used as a therapeutic agent, IND has undesirable gastrointestinal effects. PURPOSE To investigate the antitumor efficacy of IND incorporated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs+IND), as well as its toxic potential in a syngeneic murine B16 melanoma model. METHODS Antitumor activity was evaluated by measuring tumor size and weight and by histopathological analysis. Possible molecular signaling pathways involved in the antitumor activity were analyzed by Western blot in liver tissue and by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue. The potential toxicity was evaluated by determining body and organ weights and by biochemical and genotoxic analysis. RESULTS MSNPs+IND treatments inhibited tumor growth by up to 70.09% and decreased the frequency of mitosis in tumor tissues, which was up to 37.95% lower compared to the IND groups. In hepatic tissue, COX-2 levels decreased significantly after treatment with MSNPs+IND and IND. Additionally, MSNPs+IND and IND increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 (156.25% and 137.50%, respectively), inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Genotoxicity was limited to the group treated with the higher concentration of IND, while MSNPs prevented IND-induced genotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS MSNPs may be promising for future applications in cancer therapy.","Ferreira, Natália Helen; Ribeiro, Arthur Barcelos; Rinaldi-Neto, Francisco; Fernandes, Fernanda Santos; do Nascimento, Samuel; Braz, Wilson Rodrigues; Nassar, Eduardo José; Tavares, Denise Crispim",Pharmaceutical research,256,16

A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between these MTTP polymorphisms and NAFLD. Materials and Methods : A systematic search was carried out using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to retrieve English studies that reported the relationship between MTTP polymorphisms (rs1800591 and rs3816873) and NAFLD published before February 18, 2020. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to appraise the risk of MTTP polymorphism in NAFLD. Results : A total of 10 case-control studies, including 1388 cases and 1690 healthy subjects, were included. No significant correlation between the rs1800591 (G vs. T: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.68-1.70, P = 0.76) and rs3816873 (CT + CC vs. TT: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.76-2.01, P = 0.398) polymorphisms of MTTP and NAFLD was found in any of the models. However, when NASH patients confirmed by liver biopsy were extracted alone for rs1800591 polymorphism analysis, it was found that the G allele significantly increased the risk of NASH under the heterozygote model (GT vs. TT: OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.13-8.83, P = 0.028) and dominant model (GT + GG vs. TT: OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.13-8.09, P = 0.027). Conclusion The present meta-analysis revealed that the rs1800591 and rs3816873 polymorphisms of the MTTP gene are uncommon in NAFLD. However, the G allele of rs1800591 was more likely to be correlated to NASH susceptibility.","Tan, Jie; Zhang, Jian; Zhao, Zhenzhen; Zhang, Jie; Dong, Mengzhen; Ma, Xuefeng; Liu, Shousheng; Xin, Yongning",Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,256,24

We aimed to investigate DY of CE in a large cohort of young IDA patients, and evaluate factors predicting significant SB pathology. Materials and methods This was a retrospective, multicentre study (2010-2015) in consecutive, young patients (≤50 years) from 18 centres/12 countries, with negative bidirectional gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy undergoing SBCE for IDA. Exclusion criteria: previous/ongoing obscure-overt GI bleeding; age <19 or >50 years; comorbidities associated with IDA. Data retrieved: SBCE indications; prior investigations; medications; SBCE findings; final diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Results Data on 389 young IDA patients were retrieved. In total, 169 (43.4%) were excluded due to incomplete clinical data; data from 220 (122F/98M; mean age 40.5 ± 8.6 years) patients were analysed. Some 71 patients had at least one clinically significant SBCE finding (DY: 32.3%). They were divided into two groups: neoplastic pathology (10/220; 4.5%), and non-neoplastic but clinically significant pathology (61/220; 27.7%). The most common significant but non-neoplastic pathologies were angioectasias (22/61) and Crohn's disease (15/61). On multivariate analysis, weight loss and lower mean corpuscular volume(MCV) were associated with significant SB pathology (OR: 3.87; 95%CI: 1.3-11.3; p = 0.01; and OR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.92-0.99; p = 0.03; respectively). Our model also demonstrates association between use of antiplatelets and significant SB pathology, although due to the small number of patients, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. Conclusion In IDA patients ≤50 years with negative bidirectional GI endoscopy, overall DY of SBCE for clinically significant findings was 32.3%. Some 5% of our cohort was diagnosed with SB neoplasia; lower MCV or weight loss were associated with higher DY for SB pathology.","Yung, Diana E; Rondonotti, Emanuele; Giannakou, Andry; Avni, Tomer; Rosa, Bruno; Toth, Ervin; Lucendo, Alfredo J; Sidhu, Reena; Beaumont, Hanneke; Ellul, Pierre; Negreanu, Lucian; Jiménez-Garcia, Victoria Alejandra; McNamara, Deidre; Kopylov, Uri; Elli, Luca; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos; Shibli, Fahmi; Riccioni, Maria Elena; Bruno, Mauro; Dray, Xavier; Plevris, John N; Koulaouzidis, A; Argüelles-Arias, Federico; Becq, Aymeric; Branchi, Federica; Tejero-Bustos, María Ángeles; Cotter, Jose; Eliakim, Rami; Ferretti, Francesca; Gralnek, Ian M; Herrerias-Gutierrez, Juan Manuel; Hussey, Mary; Jacobs, Maarten; Johansson, Gabriele Wurm; McAlindon, Mark; Montiero, Sara; Nemeth, Artur; Pennazio, Marco; Rattehalli, Deepa; Stemate, Ana; Tortora, Annalisa; Tziatzios, Georgios",United European gastroenterology journal,256,24

The drying behavior of thin-film dewatered sewage sludge was investigated based on a conductive dryer assisted with mechanical compression at hot wall temperatures of 120-210 °C. The heat and mass transfer behavior of the sludge in the conductive drying process alone was compared to those in the mechanical compression assisted conductive drying process at three external mechanical loads of 25, 100, and 200 kPa. The average drying rates with mechanical compression were higher than those without mechanical load and were enhanced with the increase of mechanical loads at 210 °C. The extrusion of interfacial vapor film and the reduction of sludge surface roughness was responsible for the enhanced interfacial heat transfer efficiency under mechanical compression. The effective moisture diffusivity, mass transfer coefficient, and effective thermal conductivity were enhanced by mechanical compression. The improved moisture transfer inside sludge and on the open surface, and the decreased heat transfer resistance of sludge was due to the generated pressure-driven flow and the reduced gas cavities in sludge, resulting in the higher drying rates. Additionally, this finding provided reference data for developing a new sludge drying method.","Ma, Dexiao; Li, Aimin; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Dong; Ji, Guozhao",Waste management,256,20

As such, the enzyme is of fundamental importance to cellular energy metabolism, and defects in its function may be related to human disease states. Here we describe in vitro analysis of the h-mtRNAP kinetic mechanism for single, correct nucleotide incorporation. This was made possible by the development of efficient methods for expression and purification of h-mtRNAP using a bacterial system and by utilization of assays that rely on simple, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds without the need for mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins. We find that h-mtRNAP accomplishes single-nucleotide incorporation by using the same core steps, including conformational change steps before and after chemistry, that are prototypical for most types of nucleic acid polymerases. The polymerase binds to scaffolds via a two-step mechanism consisting of a fast initial-encounter step followed by a much slower isomerization that leads to catalytic competence. A substantial solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect was observed for the forward reaction, but none was detectable for the reverse reaction, suggesting that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting in the forward direction but not in the reverse. h-mtRNAP appears to exercise much more stringent surveillance over base than over sugar in determining the correctness of a nucleotide. The utility of developing the robust in vitro assays described here and of establishing a baseline of kinetic performance for the wild-type enzyme is that biological questions concerning h-mtRNAP may now begin to be addressed.","Smidansky, Eric D; Arnold, Jamie J; Reynolds, Shelley L; Cameron, Craig E",Biochemistry,256,1

A second aim was to investigate any differences between cyanotic and non-cyanotic children in relation to cerebral and splanchnic oxygen saturation during flight ≥ 5000 feet. The variability of the cerebral and splanchnic Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors was evaluated. DESIGN NIRS was used to measure rSO2-C and rSO2-A during transport of critically ill children in air ambulance. rSO2 data was collected and stored by the NIRS monitor and extracted and analyzed off-line after the transport. Prior to evaluation of the NIRS signals all zero and floor-effect values were removed. SETTING The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS In total, 44 critically ill children scheduled for inter-hospital transport by a specialized pediatric transport team were included in the study between January 2014 and January 2019 (convenience sampling). INTERVENTION No interventions were conducted. MEASUREMENTS All study patients were monitored with a cerebral NIRS-sensor placed over the forehead and an abdominal NIRS-sensor placed in the infra-umbilical area for cerebral and splanchnic regional oxygen saturation monitoring, rSO2-C and rSO2-A, respectively. MAIN RESULTS Complete rSO2-C and rSO2-A data was obtained in 39 patients. Median age was 12 days. Cyanotic congenital heart malformations were present in 9 patients (23%). In 22 patients (56%) rSO2-C decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet and in 24 patients (61%) rSO2-A decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet compared to baseline (p<0.0001).

It is essential that secure and consistent closure of full-thickness colonic resections and colotomy access be provided in natural orifice translumenal surgery (NOTES). This ex vivo porcine study aimed to evaluate a novel prototype flexible endoscopic stapler device for use in closure of full-thickness colonic defects. METHODS A feasibility study using ex vivo porcine colon was undertaken to explore the potential of the prototype stapler to close and seal a colotomy. A standardized linear colotomy was created in 30 colons. The novel flexible endostapler was used to close 20, interrupted hand-sewn sutures to close 5, and a well-validated linear stapler to close 5 of these colotomies. The colons were subsequently subjected to leak pressure testing. RESULTS The colotomy closure using the prototype stapler endoluminally required a median time of 280 s. No statistically significant difference in leak pressures between the stapler and the other techniques was described. Although the endostapler without any colotomy was found to have the highest median leak pressures and the interrupted sutures the lowest pressures, no significant difference could be demonstrated (p = 0.52). Furthermore, no significant difference was demonstrated when the closure integrity created by the flexible stapler was compared with that created by the well-validated linear stapler. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the flexible endoscopic stapler is an effective device for the safe closure of a visceral defect, which in this feasibility study was equivalent to other well-established techniques. Further studies will focus on in vivo application of the prototype stapling device in the setting of full-thickness colonic resection.","Sodergren, Mikael; Clark, James; Beardsley, John; Bryant, Ted; Horton, Kenneth; Darzi, Ara; Teare, Julian",Surgical endoscopy,256,17

Billroth I reconstruction following distal gastrectomy has the physiological advantage of allowing food to pass through the duodenum. It was hypothesized that Billroth I reconstruction would be superior to Roux-en-Y reconstruction in terms of long-term QoL after distal gastrectomy. This study compared two reconstructions in a multicentre prospective randomized clinical trial to identify the optimal reconstruction procedure. METHODS Between January 2009 and September 2010, patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were randomized during surgery to Billroth I or Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The primary endpoint was assessment of QoL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Gastric (FACT-Ga) questionnaire 36 months after surgery. RESULTS A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, 60 to Billroth I and 62 to Roux-en-Y reconstruction. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative complications or mortality, and no significant differences in FACT-Ga total score (P = 0·496). Symptom scales such as epigastric fullness (heaviness), diarrhoea and fatigue were significantly better in the Billroth I group at 36 months after gastrectomy (heaviness, P = 0·040; diarrhoea, P = 0·046; fatigue, P = 0·029). The rate of weight loss in the third year was lower for patients in the Billroth I group (P = 0·046).

The insecticidal activity of EOs against the larval stages of Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) was studied. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of these oils against pathogens transmitted by this pest was also investigated. RESULTS The obtained results indicate the possibility of using Greek oregano EO with a high content of carvacrol as a feed additive in poultry nutrition. The use of the Greek oregano oil at 1% (w/w) dose showed stronger reduction of body weight gain of stage IV larvae. Their body mass was only 10.92% of the control. Moreover, EOs from O. vulgare strongly inhibited the growth of tested bacterial strains as well as Candida albicans. CONCLUSION Greek oregano EO may be a good alternative to antibiotic growth promoters and coccidiostats whose use in feeding farm animals has been prohibited since January 2006 under European Union directives. The introduction of O. vulgare L. ssp. hirtum EO into the premises of farm and poultry houses may help to improve sanitary conditions and control of the lesser mealworm inhabiting these buildings. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.","Szczepanik, Maryla; Walczak, Maciej; Zawitowska, Beata; Michalska-Sionkowska, Marta; Szumny, Antoni; Wawrzeńczyk, Czesław; Brzezinska, Maria Swiontek",Journal of the science of food and agriculture,256,31

METHODS In 1 male cadaver the SP® Surgical System was used to perform an extraperitoneal DKT. Kidneys grafts were obtained from the local organ procurement organization after declined by all transplant centers. Kidneys were benched and wrapped in cold sponges. A periumbilical midline incision was performed. A kidney-shaped ballon was inserted through the incision to create the extraperitoneal space. SP robot was docked followed by dissection of iliac vessels bilaterally. The robot was undocked and the first graft was inserted through the wound retractor. The robot was re-docked and the renal vein anastomosis to external iliac vein was performed followed by renal artery anastomosis to external iliac artery using 5-0 monofilament sutures. Ureteroneocystostomy was performed using the Lich-Gregoir technique over a trasplant stent. Same steps were replicated for the left kidney transplant. Once procedures were done, kidneys were then harvested with the iliac vessels to examine the quality of the anastomosis. RESULTS The surgical procedure was completed successfully without the need of additional port or conversion to standard approach. Total bench kidney time was 30 minutes with overall transplantation time of 130 and 115 minutes of the right and left kidney, respectively. CONCLUSION We demonstrated the feasibility of single-port extraperitoneal DKT using the novel SP robotic platform. Limitations include the pre-clinical model. Further assessment is necessary in a truly clinical setting.","Eltemamy, Mohamed; Garisto, Juan; Miller, Eric; Wee, Alvin; Kaouk, Jihad",Urology,256,1

However, previous studies evaluating the association between MetS and incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) showed inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of MetS on the risk of VTE following TJA. METHODS Cohort studies were identified by the search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane's Library databases. A random-effect model was used if considerable heterogeneity was detected; otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used. Subgroup analyses according to the category of VTE, definition of MetS, category of procedure, and follow-up durations were performed. RESULTS Seven cohort studies with 1,341,457 patients that underwent TJA were included, with 118,060 MetS patients (8.8%) at baseline. With a follow-up duration up to 3 months after surgery, 9788 patients had VTE. Pooled results with a random-effect model showed that MetS was not associated with increased overall VTE after TJA (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 ~ 1.72, p = 0.20; I2 = 69%). The results were not significantly affected by the diagnostic criteria of MetS, category of the procedure, and follow-up durations. Subgroup analyses showed that MetS was not associated with an increased the risk of pulmonary embolism ([PE], RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.37 ~ 3.02, p = 0.91), but an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after TJA (RR 3.38, 95% CI 1.83 ~ 6.24, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Current evidence from observational studies suggests MetS might be associated with an increased risk of DVT but not PE after TJA.","Yang, Yipei; Li, Ziyue; Liang, Haifeng; Tian, Jing",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,256,12

Their distinction relies on a combination of clinical, serological, morphological and histological features. Type 1 is a pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-related disease characterized by multiorgan infiltration by IgG4 plasmocytes. In this condition, hepatobiliary infiltration is frequent and often mimics cholangiocarcinoma or primary sclerosing cholangitis. On the other hand, type 2 is commonly limited to the pancreas. Herein, we describe the case of a patient who presented a type 2 AIP associated with cholangiopathy, a condition not described in the established criteria. He first developed a pancreatitis identified as type 2 by the typical histopathological features and lack of IgG4 in the serum and tissue. Despite a good clinical response to steroids, cholestasis persisted, identified by MR cholangiography as a stricture of the left hepatic duct with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct in segments 2 and 3. Biliary cytology was negative. Evolution was favorable but after steroid tapering a few months later, the patient suffered from recurrence of the pancreatitis as well as progression of biliary attempt, suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma. As the investigations again ruled out neoplastic infiltration or primary sclerosing cholangitis, azathioprine was initiated with resolution of both pancreatic and biliary attempts.","Ollo, Diana; Terraz, Sylvain; Arnoux, Gregoire; Puppa, Giacomo; Frossard, Jean-Louis; Bichard, Philippe",Case reports in gastroenterology,256,12

Upon exposure to physiological or environmental fluids, it is likely that protein nanoparticles, like synthetic nanoparticles, will adsorb proteins and this protein corona will be dependent on the surface properties of the protein nanoparticles. As there is little understanding of this phenomenon for engineered protein nanoparticles, the purpose of this work was to create protein nanoparticles with variable surface hydrophobicity and surface charge and establish the effect of these properties on the mass and composition of the adsorbed corona, using the fetal bovine serum as a model physiological solution. Albumin, cationic albumin, and ovalbumin cross-linked nanoparticles were developed for this investigation and their adsorbed protein coronas were isolated and characterized by gel electrophoresis and nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Distinct trends in corona mass and composition were identified for protein nanoparticles based on surface charge and surface hydrophobicity. Proteomic analyses revealed unique protein corona patterns and identified distinct proteins that are known to affect nanoparticle clearance in vivo. Further, the protein corona influenced nanoparticle internalization in vitro in a macrophage cell line. Altogether, these results demonstrate the strong effect protein identity and properties have on the corona formed on nanoparticles made from that protein. This work builds the foundation for future study of protein coronas on the wide array of protein nanoparticles used in nanomedicine and environmental applications.","Pustulka, Samantha M; Ling, Kevin; Pish, Stephanie L; Champion, Julie A",ACS applied materials & interfaces,256,23

The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) receives reciprocal inputs from the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), the circumventricular organs that have been shown to be necessary in multiple central effects of changes in the osmolality and circulating ANG II directed toward the maintenance of sodium and water homeostasis. We, therefore, hypothesized that the MnPO is a crucial part of the central neuronal mechanisms mediating the blood pressure control by altered osmolality and/or ANG II signaling during chronic high dietary salt intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham (operation), or electrolytic lesion of the MnPO. After a 7-day recovery, rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric transducers and aortic flow probes for the measurement of the mean arterial pressure + heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO), respectively. Femoral venous catheters were also implanted to collect blood for the measurements of plasma osmolality and sodium concentration, as well as plasma renin activity. Rats were given another 10 days to recover and then were subjected to a 28-day-long study protocol that included a 7-day control period (1.0% NaCl diet), followed by 14 days of high salt (4.0% NaCl), and a 7-day recovery period (1.0% NaCl). The data showed, that despite a slight increase in the MAP observed in both MnPO- (n = 12) and sham-lesioned (n = 8) rats during the high-salt period, there were no significant differences between the MAP, HR, and CO in the two groups throughout the study protocol. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the MnPO is necessary to maintain normal blood pressure during high dietary salt intake. However, MnPO-lesioned rats showed less sodium balance than sham-lesioned rats during the first 4 days of high salt intake. Although, these results may be explained partly by the plasma hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia observed in MnPO-lesioned rats; they also shed light on the role of the MnPO in central neuronal control of renal sodium handling during chronic high dietary salt intake.","Ployngam, T; Katz, S S; Collister, J P",Neurophysiology,256,1

In the case of SARS-CoV, heptad repeat domains of the envelope glycoprotein, termed S2-HR1 and S2-HR2, are thought to undergo structural changes from a prefusion state, in which S2-HR1 and S2-HR2 do not interact, to a postfusion state in which S2-HR1 and S2-HR2 associate to form a six-helix bundle. In the present work, the structural and dynamic properties of S2-HR2 have been characterized. Evidence is presented for an equilibrium between a structured trimer thought to represent a prefusion state and an ensemble of unstructured monomers thought to represent a novel transition state. A model for viral entry is presented in which S2-HR2 is in a dynamic equilibrium between an ensemble of unstructured monomers in the transition state and a structured trimer in the prefusion state. Conversion from the prefusion state to the postfusion state requires passage through the transition state, a state that may give insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS-CoV in particular, as well as other enveloped viruses in general.","McReynolds, Susanna; Jiang, Shaokai; Guo, Ying; Celigoy, Jessica; Schar, Christine; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael",Biochemistry,256,1

Whether such disparities extend to patients with ESKD, who simultaneously are at risk for complications of infection and have extensive contact with health care providers, has not been investigated. METHODS To determine whether the proportion of patients vaccinated at a dialysis facility differs according to the facility's racial and ethnic composition, we examined dialysis facility data reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The main outcome was the proportion of facility patients vaccinated for influenza among 6735 Medicare-certified facilities operating between 2014 and 2017. RESULTS Among dialysis facilities, the mean percentage of patients vaccinated during the influenza season was 72.1%. Facilities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower vaccination percentages than less diverse facilities. The average proportion of patients vaccinated at each facility decreased significantly from 2014 to 2017 (a decrease of 1.05% vaccinated per year) and decreased significantly more so among facilities with higher minority proportions. The share of vaccinated patients in facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion of Black patients decreased 1.21% per year compared with a decrease of 0.88% per year in facilities in the quartile with the lowest proportion of Black patients. We found similar trends for Hispanic patients. CONCLUSIONS Rates of seasonal influenza vaccination are modestly but significantly lower among dialysis facilities with larger proportions of minority patients, and the gap seems to be widening over time. As wide-scale vaccination efforts grow more urgent amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities must be addressed to protect patients and communities equitably.","Danziger, John; Weinhandl, Eric; Friedman, David; Mukamal, Kenneth J",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,256,1

The benefit of IAT in patients with midrange Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) remains to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of LVOS with ASPECTS 5-7 treated with IAT (n = 86) or medical therapy alone (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; n = 15) at two centers from 2009 to 2012. Definitions were as follows: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage = any parenchymal hematoma; successful reperfusion = mTICI ≥2b; good and acceptable outcomes = 90-day mRS 0-2 and 0-3, respectively. Final infarct volumes (FIV) were calculated based on 24-hour CT/MRI scans. RESULTS Mean age (67 ± 14 vs. 67 ± 19 years) and baseline NIHSS (20 ± 5 vs. 20 ± 6) were similar in the two groups. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 58 (67%) IAT patients. Symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 9 (10%) and 31 (36%) IAT patients, respectively. The proportion of 90-day good and acceptable outcomes was 20 (17/86) and 33% (28/86), respectively. Successful IAT reperfusion was associated with smaller FIV (p = 0.015) and higher rates of good (p = 0.01) and acceptable (p = 0.014) outcomes. There was a strong trend towards a higher hemicraniectomy requirement in medically as compared to endovascularly treated patients (20 vs. 6%; p = 0.06) despite similar in-hospital mortality. The median FIV was significantly lower with IAT versus medical therapy [80 ml (interquartile range, 38-122) vs. 190 ml (121-267); p = 0.015]. CONCLUSIONS Despite a relatively low probability of achieving functional independence, IAT in LVOS patients with ASPECTS 5-7 appears to result in lower degrees of disability and may lessen the need for hemicraniectomy. Therefore, it may be a reasonable option for patients and families who favor a shift from severe to moderate disability.","Noorian, Ali Reza; Rangaraju, Srikant; Sun, Chung-Huan; Owada, Kumiko; Nahab, Fadi; Belagaje, Samir R; Anderson, Aaron M; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,256,1

However, the use of both types of treatment in upper rectal cancer is controversial. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to assess oncological results after radical resection of upper rectal cancers compared with sigmoid, middle, and lower rectal cancers and to determine risk factors for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer. DESIGN This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTINGS This study was conducted in a tertiary care referral hospital in Valencia, Spain. PATIENTS Analysis included 1145 patients who underwent colorectal resection with primary curative intent for primary sigmoid (n = 450), rectosigmoid (n = 70), upper rectal (n = 178), middle rectal (n = 186), or lower rectal (n = 261) cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Oncological results, including local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival, were compared between the different tumor locations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer. RESULTS A total of 147 patients (82.6%) with upper rectal tumors underwent partial mesorectal excision, and only 10 patients (5.6%) of that group received preoperative chemoradiation. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival rates for upper rectal tumors were 4.9%, 82.0%, and 91.6%. Local recurrence rates showed no differences when compared among all of the locations (p = 0.20), whereas disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival were shorter for lower rectal tumors (p = 0.006; p = 0.003). The only independent risk factor for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer was an involved circumferential resection margin at pathologic analysis (HR, 14.23 (95% CI, 2.75-73.71); p = 0.002). LIMITATIONS This was a single-institution, retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS Most upper rectal tumors can be treated with partial mesorectal excision without the systematic use of preoperative chemoradiation. Involvement of the mesorectal fascia was the only independent risk factor for local recurrence in these tumors.","Marinello, Franco G; Frasson, Matteo; Baguena, Gloria; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Cervantes, Andres; Roselló, Susana; Espí, Alejandro; García-Granero, Eduardo",Diseases of the colon and rectum,256,7

AIMS To explore the attitudes of Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) clinicians and patients experiencing severe mental illness towards physical healthcare and its provision. DESIGN AND SETTING Qualitative study in a CMHT setting. METHODS Interviews were carried out with CMHT clinicians and patients with severe mental illness. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS There were 14 patients and 15 clinicians recruited. Patients varied in their awareness of the association between physical and mental health, but were engaged in physical health monitoring. Clinicians were aware of the importance of physical healthcare but reported barriers to provision, including lack of training, resource constraints and uncertainty in their role. There was no consensus in either group regarding how physical healthcare should be provided, with diverse attitudes expressed for why CMHTs should and shouldn't provide more physical healthcare. CONCLUSIONS Increasing physical healthcare provision from mental health teams requires healthcare-related barriers be addressed, but it remains unclear whether CMHT clinicians or patients believe this to be a solution.","Butler, Joseph; de Cassan, Simone; Turner, Phil; Lennox, Belinda; Hayward, Gail; Glogowska, Margaret",BMC family practice,256,1

To set the stage, we first briefly simulate and illustrate the benefit of lockdown. With these lockdown scenarios, and in general, the more dominant influence of the the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious over the symptomatic infectious, is shown in various ways. Numerical simulations for the U.S. show that an increase in testing and isolating for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has up to 4 times more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious in terms of cumulative deaths. An increase in testing for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group also has significantly more impact (on the order of twice as much) on reducing the control reproduction number than testing for symptomatic infectious. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (once an epicenter for COVID-19). These simulations provide specific examples confirming that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths before immunity is achieved, and as such, this strategy is certainly questionable in terms of success.","Scott, Sherry E; Cook, Keisha J; Barley, Kamal",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,256,16

Peroperative haemostasis was comparable in the two groups. Postoperative haemorrhage was higher than expected, which needs to be further investigated. A new handpiece, specifically designed for tonsillectomy, could probably improve surgical performance regarding operative time. OBJECTIVE To compare tonsillectomy using Ligasure with bipolar diathermy scissors with regard to operative time, blood loss and complications. METHODS This was a prospective study; 150 patients (> 15 years of age) undergoing tonsillectomy were randomized to tonsillectomy using either Ligasure or bipolar diathermy scissors. Operative time, peroperative blood loss, postoperative pain and complications were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS A total of 149 cases were included, 75 randomized to Ligasure tonsillectomy and 74 to bipolar diathermy scissors tonsillectomy. Peroperative blood loss was similar in both groups. On average the operative time was 8 min longer in the Ligasure group. Postoperative pain was similar in the two groups. Twenty patients (13%) experienced postoperative haemorrhage, which is higher than our previous material. Slightly fewer patients experienced postoperative haemorrhage in the Ligasure group compared with the diathermy scissors group but the difference was not significant. Two of the 20 patients that experienced postoperative haemorrhage required a return to theatre to stop the bleeding, fewer than previously observed. No other complications were seen.","Attner, Per; Hemlin, Claes; Söderman, Anne-Charlotte Hessén",Acta oto-laryngologica,256,31

The historical roots of this process date back to the mid-nineteenth century, when national authorities realized that the cross-boundary spread of diseases cannot be only a matter of national governance but requires common agreements and regulations. In the early 1950s the structuring of the World Health Organization in regional offices further contributed to the definition of Europe as a unit for risk assessments and international health cooperation. More recently the consolidation of the European Union has provided new institutional bases for shaping communicable disease policies at the supranational level. This article reviews these different attempts to protect the European space from diseases. It is argued that changing modes of communicable disease control not only have reflected shifts in public health priorities and institutional contexts but have also been important loci where different understandings of Europe and European political identity emerged and were negotiated. Against this background the article then examines past achievements and future challenges of the current European framework and discusses implications for the wider process of European integration.","Liverani, Marco; Coker, Richard","Journal of health politics, policy and law",256,1

The disease is characterized by a pre-symptomatic infectious stage that makes detection and control of cases more difficult. The effectiveness of local (ring-vaccination or culling) and global control strategies is analysed by comparing the net present values of the combined cost of preventive treatment and illness. The optimal strategy is then selected by minimizing the total cost of the epidemic. We show that three main strategies emerge, with treating a large number of individuals (global strategy, GS), treating a small number of individuals in a well-defined neighbourhood of a detected case (local strategy) and allowing the disease to spread unchecked (null strategy, NS). The choice of the optimal strategy is governed mainly by a relative cost of palliative and preventive treatments. If the disease spreads within the well-defined neighbourhood, the local strategy is optimal unless the cost of a single vaccine is much higher than the cost associated with hospitalization. In the latter case, it is most cost-effective to refrain from prevention. Destruction of local correlations, either by long-range (small-world) links or by inclusion of many initial foci, expands the range of costs for which the NS is most cost-effective. The GS emerges for the case when the cost of prevention is much lower than the cost of treatment and there is a substantial non-local component in the disease spread. We also show that local treatment is only desirable if the disease spreads on a small-world network with sufficiently few long-range links; otherwise it is optimal to treat globally. In the mean-field case, there are only two optimal solutions, to treat all if the cost of the vaccine is low and to treat nobody if it is high. The basic reproduction ratio, R(0), does not depend on the rate of responsive treatment in this case and the disease always invades (but might be stopped afterwards). The details of the local control strategy, and in particular the optimal size of the control neighbourhood, are determined by the epidemiology of the disease. The properties of the pathogen might not be known in advance for emerging diseases, but the broad choice of the strategy can be made based on economic analysis only.","Kleczkowski, Adam; Oleś, Katarzyna; Gudowska-Nowak, Ewa; Gilligan, Christopher A","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",256,1

The authors sought to determine whether A1 pulley release affects work of flexion after a zone 2 flexor tendon repair. METHODS Four fresh-frozen cadaveric hands were thawed to room temperature. The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus tendons were tested in a tensile testing machine. In hands 1 and 2, work of flexion of uninjured tendons was evaluated through the sequential division of the A1 pulley, starting with either the proximal 50 percent or the distal 50 percent of the pulley. In hands 3 and 4, zone 2 flexor digitorum profundus lacerations were created and repaired using a modified Kessler technique; then, sequential division of the A1 pulley was performed. Force-excursion curves were generated and used to calculate work of flexion. Analysis of variance was performed for multigroup comparisons, and t tests were performed for pairwise comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS In uninjured tendons, work of flexion decreased with sequential division of the A1 pulley. After tendon repair, work of flexion increased significantly from baseline in all digits. A1 pulley release after flexor tendon repair produced significant decreases in work of flexion in all digits. CONCLUSIONS A1 pulley release effectively decreases work of flexion after flexor tendon repair. Release performed at the time of tendon repair may decrease the forces across tendons in the postoperative period.","Buonocore, Samuel D; Broer, P Niclas; Kaldany, Alain; Sawh-Martinez, Rajendra; Thomson, J Grant",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,256,7

In contrast to that, recent evidence unfolds a different view. Using ""PubMed"" and ""Scopus"" searches, we examined if the novel understanding regarding the cardia goes in line with the concept of unfolding, as described by Heidegger based on the ancient didactic poetry of Parmenides. What has been taken as gastric cardia in fact represents reflux-damaged, dilated, columnar lined oesophagus (CLO): dilated distal oesophagus (DDO). Due to its macroscopic gastric appearance it cannot be discriminated from the stomach by endoscopy. Differentiation between DDE and proximal stomach requires the histopathology of measured multi-level biopsies obtained from the DDO and the proximal stomach. Cardaic, onxytocardiac mucosa and intestinal metaplasia (IM; Barrett's oesophagus) define CLO and thus the oesophageal location, while oxyntic mucosa (OM) of the proximal stomach verifies a gastric biopsy location. Endoscopically visible CLO and DDO define the morphological manifestation of reflux: the squamo-oxyntic gap (SOG). Biopsies obtained from the level of the diaphragmatic impressions allow differentiation between an enlarged hiatus with normal anatomic content (CLO; oesophagus) vs. hernia with abnormal content (OM; stomach). Non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus exists in 10 %-17 % of asymptomatic and in 20 %-100 % (with increasing CLO length) of reflux symptom-positive individuals (annual cancer risk: 0.2 %-0.7 %). These data justify biopsy of an endoscopically normal appearing squamocolumnar junction for the exclusion of Barrett's oesophagus and cancer risk. In the absence of contraindications, cancer risk-based therapy of dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus includes radiofrequency ablation (RFA) ± endoscopic resection. The perception of the cardia as reflux damaged DDO mirrors the concept of unfolding, as described by the interpretation of the didactic poem of Parmenides by Heidegger. Our data recommend to omit the term ""cardia"" and allocate morphology either to the oesophagus (CLO, DDO) or to the proximal stomach or indicate that allocation is impossible (i. e.. tumour-induced). Future studies will have to test the value of this novel concept for diagnosis, treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and cancer prevention.","Riegler, M; Asari, R; Cosentini, E P; Wrba, F; Schoppmann, S F",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,256,23

Non-i-synchronized (like airway pressure release ventilation, APRV), partially i-synchronized (like biphasic airway pressure), and fully i-synchronized modes (like assist-pressure control) can be distinguished. Under identical ventilatory settings across PPV modes, the degree of i-synchronization may affect tidal volume (VT), transpulmonary pressure (PTP), and their variability. We performed bench and clinical studies. METHODS In the bench study, all the PPV modes of five ventilators were tested with an active lung simulator. Spontaneous efforts of -10 cmH2O at rates of 20 and 30 breaths/min were simulated. Ventilator settings were high pressure 30 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 15 cmH2O, frequency 15 breaths/min, and inspiratory to expiratory ratios (I:E) 1:3 and 3:1. In the clinical studies, data from eight intubated patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilated with APRV were compared to the bench tests. In four additional ARDS patients, each of the PPV modes was compared. RESULTS As the degree of i-synchronization among the different PPV modes increased, mean VT and PTP swings markedly increased while breathing variability decreased. This was consistent with clinical comparison in four ARDS patients. Observational results in eight ARDS patients show low VT and a high variability with APRV. CONCLUSION Despite identical ventilator settings, the different PPV modes lead to substantial differences in VT, PTP, and breathing variability in the presence spontaneous efforts. Clinicians should be aware of the possible harmful effects of i-synchronization especially when high VT is undesirable.","Richard, J C M; Lyazidi, A; Akoumianaki, E; Mortaza, S; Cordioli, R L; Lefebvre, J C; Rey, N; Piquilloud, L; Sferrazza Papa, G F; Mercat, A; Brochard, L",Intensive care medicine,256,16

OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes and the risk mitigation practices utilized by youth soccer organizations. DESIGN Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS Youth soccer club directors throughout the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR=0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: b=0.35±0.67, p=0.61; contact: b=0.18±0.67, p=0.79). Soccer clubs reported utilizing a median of 8 (IQR: 6-10) risk reduction procedures. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States in summer of 2020. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer.","Watson, Andrew M; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Biese, Kevin; Goodavish, Leslie; Stevens, Bethany; McGuine, Timothy",Journal of athletic training,256,1

We describe the development of a new system of guidewire-assisted tracheal intubation that may circumvent these problems. A reinforced silicone tracheal tube was modified with a guide channel built inside its wall, and a nitinol non-kinking guidewire was matched to this channel. Both anterograde and retrograde tracheal intubation were evaluated in a test rig, an airway manikin and then in preserved and fresh cadavers. There was minimal resistance to passage of the guidewire through the guide channel when the modified tube was in an anatomical configuration, in contrast to moderate resistance when an Airway Exchange Catheter was passed through a PVC tracheal tube. Intubation using the new equipment required increased force in the manikin and preserved cadavers, but minimal force in fresh cadavers. Resistance to tracheal tube advancement in preserved cadavers was overcome by withdrawal followed by 90° rotation, but this manoeuvre was not required in fresh cadavers. We suggest that the combination of the modified tracheal tube and matching guidewire may allow easy and reliable single-step guided tracheal intubation when used in patients.","Dhara, S S; McGlone, D J; Skinner, M W",Anaesthesia,256,22

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 346 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion at our peritoneal dialysis center. The traditional procedure was performed in 157 patients (group A) and the modified procedure in 189 patients (group B). The double-polyester-cuff straight Tenckhoff catheter was used in all patients. RESULTS At the end of 1 year, tunnel inflammation was more common in group A (21 patients after 0.011 patient-months follow-up versus 10 patients in group B after 0.007 patient-months of follow-up; p = 0.009). Technical survival rate of the catheter was significantly higher in group B (97.35% in group B vs. 89.81% in group A; p = 0.005). All-cause mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (4.5% in group A vs. 3.2% in group B; p = 0.532). Postoperative mechanical complications were also higher in group A (32 patients [20.4%] in group A vs. 3 patients [1.6%] in group B; p < 0.001). The incidences of complications such as hernia, dialysis fluid leakage, hemorrhage, incision infection, and prolapse of the polyester cuff were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION The simple modified peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion procedure decreases the occurrence of catheter migration andomental encapsulation and improves the technical survival rate of the catheter.","Li, Yingqin; Zhu, Ye; Liang, Zibin; Zheng, Xiaobin; Zhang, Huitao; Zhu, Weiping",International urology and nephrology,256,10

We examined 20 peptides in silico and experimentally, which showed that a tyrosine substitution (Y6-pepVIII) maximizes proteasome cleavage and survival in a subcutaneous tumor model in mice. In an intracranial glioma model, Y6-pepVIII showed a 62 and 31% improvement in median survival compared to control animals and pepVIII-vaccinated mice. Y6-pepVIII vaccination altered tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subsets and expression of PD-1 on intratumoral T cells. Combination with anti-PD-1 therapy cured 45% of the Y6-pepVIII-vaccinated mice but was ineffective for pepVIII-treated mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteasome-digested pepVIII and Y6-pepVIII revealed that most fragments were similar but more abundant in Y6-pepVIII digests and 77% resulted from proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS). We identified 10 peptides that bound human and murine MHC class I. Nine were PCPS products and only one peptide was colinear with EGFRvIII, indicating that PCPS fragments may be a component of MHC class I recognition. Despite not being colinear with EGFRvIII, two of three PCPS products tested were capable of increasing survival when administered independently as vaccines. We hypothesize that the immune response to a vaccine represents the collective contribution from multiple PCPS and linear products. Our work suggests a strategy to increase proteasomal processing of a vaccine that results in an augmented immune response and enhanced survival in mice.","Fidanza, Mario; Gupta, Puja; Sayana, Anin; Shanker, Varun; Pahlke, Svenja-Maria; Vu, Brandon; Krantz, Fanny; Azameera, Aruna; Wong, Nicollette; Anne, Navya; Xia, Yuanxuan; Rong, Jiming; Anne, Avani; Skirboll, Stephen; Lim, Michael; Wong, Albert J",Science translational medicine,256,16

RESULTS At the calf level, serum anti-BCV antibody abundance was not associated with BCV shedding, but BCV shedding was positively associated with BRD incidence before and after weaning. The mean serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for a group of calves was inversely related with the subsequent incidence of BRD in that group; however, the serum anti-BCV antibody abundance at weaning for individual calves was not predictive of which calves would develop BRD after feedlot entry.

RESULTS Data were analyzed for the 4199 (72.0% of 5834) participants with complete data. The mean age of participants was 53.9 years and 85.4% were White. After adjusting for covariates, including adult chronic disease, ACEs, and childhood and current SED, mean (95% CI) flourishing z scores increased from the lowest to highest quartiles of family connection: -0.41 (-0.49, -0.33), -0.18 (-0.25, -0.12), -0.01 (-0.07, 0.06), and 0.25 (0.18, 0.32), respectively. For each 1 SD increase in the family connection score, there was a 0.25 (95% CI, 0.20, 0.29) unit increase in the adjusted flourishing z score. This positive association was also present across levels of ACEs and childhood SED. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Greater childhood family connection was associated with greater flourishing in US adults across levels of childhood adversity. Supporting family connection in childhood may influence flourishing decades later, even with early adversity.","Whitaker, Robert C; Dearth-Wesley, Tracy; Herman, Allison N",Academic pediatrics,256,7

We established a porcine model for renal transplantation from an adult donor to a small or size-matched recipient with a high risk of DGF and studied GFR, RPP using MRI, and markers of kidney injury within 10 h after transplantation. After induction of BD, kidneys were removed from ∼63-kg donors and kept in cold storage for ∼22 h until transplanted into small (∼15 kg, n = 8) or size-matched (n = 8) recipients. A reduction in GFR was observed in small recipients within 60 min after reperfusion. Interestingly, this was associated with a significant reduction in medullary RPP, while there was no significant change in the size-matched recipients. No difference was observed in urinary NGAL excretion between the groups. A significant higher level of HO-1 mRNA was observed in small recipients than in donors and size-matched recipients indicating cortical injury. Improvement in early graft perfusion may be a goal to improve short- and long-term GFR and avoid graft thrombosis in pediatric recipients.","Ravlo, Kristian; Chhoden, Tashi; Søndergaard, Peter; Secher, Niels; Keller, Anna K; Pedersen, Michael; Bibby, Bo M; Jørgensen, Troels Munch; Møldrup, Ulla; Ostraat, Ernst Øivind; Birn, Henrik; Nørregaard, Rikke; Marcussen, Niels; Leuvenink, Henri G; Jespersen, Bente",Pediatric transplantation,256,16

Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus. The present study aims to report hallucinations induced by hydroxychloroquine. CASE PRESENTATION A 37-year-old woman came to the dermatology clinic with a complaint of a red lesion on her left cheek. Physical examination revealed an ulcerative erythematous plaque with keratotic scales, an atrophic area of ~ 2 × 2.5 cm. Biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathology result was consistent with the diagnosis of DLE. Laboratory tests were all normal. Topical clobetasol and pimecrolimus were prescribed for the patient, who was recommended to use sunscreen as well. However, the treatment did not work, thus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was added to the treatment. After a week, the patient came back to the clinic with her husband with the complaint of auditory and visual hallucinations, nightmares, and occasional decrease in consciousness level. After neurology and psychiatric consultation, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and replaced with intralesional administration of triamcinolone. The lesion disappeared and did not recur. DISCUSSION Previous studies and the lack of another explanation for the patient's hallucinations imply a strong correlation between hydroxychloroquine and hallucinations. The mechanism of these side effects has not been fully elucidated. However, this side effect has only been reported in cases of connective tissue diseases. As currently hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases, its potential risk of psychiatric complications should be considered in clinical practice.","Ganjei, Zakiye; Bahmani, Kiumars",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,256,1

The government has taken massive actions, in terms of lockdowns, quarantine homes, testing facilities, closure of schools, and mass gatherings at places, to combat COVID-19. However, the measures seem to be insufficient due to the fear and stigma attached to it and the low socio-economic conditions. The government has launched initiatives, like Ehsaas cash dissemination programme, for the underprivileged families to address their basic needs; and philanthropic organisations are also coming forward to support these families.

METHODS Data from three different online databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched on 29 April 2020 and after duplicate, irrelevant, and inappropriate records were excluded, data extraction was done. RESULTS The 22 records included for analysis provided 57 patients with neurological sequelae. The neurological complications reported ranged widely from ischemic cerebrovascular accidents to cerebral hemorrhage and were seen at both peripheral and central nervous system levels. The most frequently reported neurological complication was acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident, followed by Guillain-Barré syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Considering the possibility of neurological involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in earlier diagnosis and treatment; otherwise permanent, irreversible sequelae and even death may follow. More comprehensive studies may indicate that until the end of the present pandemic, young adults with unexplained and unexpected stroke as well as patients with newly diagnosed Guillain-Barré syndrome should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Taherifard, Ehsan; Taherifard, Erfan",Neurological research,256,5

Specifically, cells were observed after cytokinesis failure was induced by dihydrocytochalasin B (H2CB). β-HPV 8E6 attenuated the immediate toxicity associated with H2CB but did not promote long-term proliferation after H2CB. Immortalization by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation also rarely allowed cells to sustain proliferation after H2CB exposure. In contrast, TERT expression combined with β-HPV 8E6 expression allowed cells to proliferate for months following cytokinesis failure. However, this continued proliferation comes with genome destabilizing consequences.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection following nonelective hip and knee surgery during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey during this time. A retrospective cohort of 149 patients who underwent nonelective hip and knee surgery from March 27, 2020, through May 25, 2020, at 2 institutions was identified. The cohort was divided into hip fracture and non-fracture patients to compare the postoperative experience of these patient populations. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection diagnosed via severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, discharge disposition, postoperative complications, and mortality rate. A total of 149 patients underwent nonelective hip and knee surgeries, including 76 hip fracture cases and 73 nonelective hip and knee arthroplasty cases.

We studied the incidence, risk factors and microbiological spectrum of jugular NTHC-associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) at a tertiary care center in South Asia. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, all adult (≥18 years) incident patients who underwent jugular NTHC insertion for HD between January 2016 and June 2017, had no prior history of temporary vascular access insertion and were followed up for ≥14 days were included. Results A total of 897 patients underwent NTHC insertion during the study period and 169 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and contributed 7079 patient days of follow-up. CABSI incidence was 7.34 episodes per 1000 catheter days and median infection-free survival and time to CABSI were 96 and 24.5 days, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, immunosuppressive medication {hazard ratio [HR] 2.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-7.55]; P = 0.033} and intravenous cefazolin use [HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.28-0.94); P = 0.031] was independently associated with CABSI. The cumulative hazard of CABSI was 8.3, 13.3, 17.6 and 20.9% at Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Gram-negative organisms were the most common etiological agents (54.7%) and 40.3% of CABSIs were caused by drug-resistant organisms. Gram-negative and Gram-positive CABSIs were associated with neutrophil left shift and higher procalcitonin compared with coagulase-negative staphylococcal CABSIs. Conclusion In South Asia, NTHC-associated CABSIs occur early and are predominantly Gram negative.

Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System Inhibitors (RAASi) that are indicated for slowing down progression of kidney disease are often associated with hyperkalemia which becomes a limiting factor in their use and titration to the maximum dose. Having a safe, effective, tolerable, and affordable potassium binder can help optimize RAAS inhibition in the setting of kidney disease. AREAS COVERED Although sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been a mainstay of acute management of hyperkalemia for decades, evidence regarding its efficacy is limited, and its chronic use is not routinely recommended for concerns regarding toxicity. The concern of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects with sodium polystyrene sulfonate has spurred the development of alternatives. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a promising agent that selectively binds potassium in the gut and eliminates it, while being safe for chronic use based on 1 year of data. Even though we do not have head-to-head studies among the three currently available binders, SZC stands out in rapidity of onset and efficacy.

Management strategies for these lesions have undergone considerable evolution in the last decade with the advent of new endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical technologies. This study sought to review current treatment strategies and long-term clinical outcomes at a high-volume cerebrovascular institute. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of cerebral AVF from 1999 to 2012. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and age > 18 years were excluded from final analysis. Medical history, surgical and nonsurgical treatment, and clinical outcomes were documented. Pre- and postoperative angiograms were analyzed to assess for obliteration of the fistula. RESULTS Seventeen patients with pial AVFs (29.4%), dural AVFs (64.7%), or mixed pial/dural AVFs (5.9%) were identified. The majority of lesions were paramedian (70.6%) and supratentorial (76.5%). The study population had a mean age of 6.4 years, with a slight male predominance (52.9%), and the most common presenting symptoms were seizures (23.5%), headaches (17.6%), congestive heart failure (11.7%), and enlarging head circumference (11.7%). Among patients who underwent intervention (n = 16), 56.3% were treated with endovascular therapy alone, 6.3% were treated with open surgery alone, and 37.5% required a multimodal approach. Overall, 93.8% of the treated patients received endovascular treatment, 43.8% received open surgery, and 12.5% received radiosurgery. Endovascular embolysates included Onyx (n = 5), N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA; n = 4), or coil embolization (n = 7) with or without balloon assistance (n = 2). Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved in 87.5% at the last follow-up evaluation (mean follow-up 3.1 years). One infant with incomplete AVF obliteration died of congestive heart failure, and 1 patient with complete obliteration died of acute sinus thrombosis, with an overall complication rate of 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cerebral AVFs are challenging neurosurgical lesions. Although advancements in endovascular therapy in the last decade have greatly changed the natural course of this disease, a multidisciplinary approach remains necessary for a large subset of patients. Surgeon experience with a thorough analysis of preoperative imaging is paramount to achieving acceptable clinical outcomes.","Zaidi, Hasan A; Kalani, M Yashar S; Spetzler, Robert F; McDougall, Cameron G; Albuquerque, Felipe C",Journal of neurosurgery.

In this paper, I explore options to expand access to affordable coverage and care for those who do not qualify for Medicaid or Marketplace financial assistance, and further discuss opportunities to increase enrollment among those who are already eligible. I also examine opportunities to expand access to specific services, including reproductive health care, among those with insurance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were extracted from the national certification program database of the German Roentgen Society (DRG) from 2015-2021. A nationwide online survey among radiology institutes (university hospitals, non-university hospitals, and private practices) was conducted for 2019, and data was extracted from the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) registry. The data collection's key points included the number of centers and individuals certified for CVI, the number of cardiac CT and MRI examinations performed, the reporting habits, and the participation in the ESCR registry. RESULTS 71 centers and 1278 persons, both with a substantial increase since 2015, were registered and certified by the DRG to perform CVI. According to the survey, a total of 69,286 CT and 64,281 MRI examinations were performed annually. Data from the survey and the ESCR registry indicated that reporting was mostly done solely by radiologists or, to a lesser degree, in joint consensus meetings with non-radiologists. The overall participation rate in the ESCR registry was 48 % among the survey's participants. CONCLUSION This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that high-quality CVI by radiologists is available nationwide. The current challenges are to provide the best medical and technical quality of CVI by radiology for patient care and to ensure economic sustainability in the German health care system to accommodate the predicted substantial need for CVI in the future. KEY POINTS · High-quality advanced CVI service by radiologists is available nationwide.. · Highly qualified specialist knowledge is widely represented from university to private practices.. · Certification programs successfully contribute to the dissemination & deepening of CVI expertise.. · The ESCR registry is an established international tool for the documentation of CVI..

However, it causes human as well as animal toxicities. In this study, we aimed to ascertain the toxic constituents in Rhizoma Coptidis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The acute toxicity of both the total extract and the alkaloid-rich extract of Rhizoma Coptidis were tested in mice. The dose related tissue concentration of the Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids in mice was determined using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The influence of phenobarbital sodium [a non-selective hepatic enzyme (P450) inducer] on the acute toxicity of Rhizoma Coptidis as well as the tissue concentration of the alkaloids was investigated. The cytotoxicity of the Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids was tested in six cell lines using the MTT assay. RESULTS The median acute oral lethal dose of the total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis was 2.95g/kg in mice. The alkaloid-rich extract was much more toxic than the total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis. Four Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids were detected in brain, heart, and lung tissues of mice that received the oral total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis. Tissue concentration increased nonlinearly with higher doses. Phenobarbital sodium decreased the tissue concentration of every alkaloid as well as the toxicity of Rhizoma Coptidis. All alkaloids, especially berberine, showed dose and time dependent cytotoxicity.

The experience of Choosing Wisely campaigns can offer potential strategies for driving increased awareness and action from healthcare stakeholders on the climate crisis. This commentary explores some of the factors that have contributed to the spread of Choosing Wisely campaigns and the levers that have fostered campaign uptake. It will also consider the challenges faced by, and lessons learned, from Choosing Wisely campaigns, and how these could inform healthcare systems and individual clinicians in increasing awareness and taking leadership on the climate crisis.","Born, Karen; Levinson, Wendy",HealthcarePapers,256,16

Here, we show that the abundance of sequons (NXT or NXS), which are sites for N-glycosylation of secreted and membrane proteins, varies by more than a factor of 4 among phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes, based on a few variables. There is positive correlation between the density of sequons and the AT content of coding regions, although no causality can be inferred. In contrast, there appears to be Darwinian selection for sequons containing Thr, but not Ser, in eukaryotes that have N-glycan-dependent QC systems. Selection for sequons with Thr, which nearly doubles the sequon density in human secreted and membrane proteins, occurs by an increased conditional probability that Asn and Thr are present in sequons rather than elsewhere. Increasing sequon densities of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 during the past few decades of human infection also result from an increased conditional probability that Asn, Thr, and Ser are present in sequons rather than elsewhere. In contrast, there is no selection on sequons by this mechanism in HA of A/H5N1 or 2009 A/H1N1 (Swine flu). Very strong selection for sequons with both Thr and Ser in glycoprotein of M(r) 120,000 (gp120) of HIV and related retroviruses results from this same mechanism, as well as amino acid composition bias and increases in AT content. We conclude that there is Darwinian selection for sequons in phylogenetically disparate eukaryotes and viruses.","Cui, Jike; Smith, Temple; Robbins, Phillips W; Samuelson, John",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,256,1

METHODS This retrospective comparative study included 67 consecutive patients who underwent LDP (n = 32) and ODP (n = 35) for benign or low-grade malignant lesions of the pancreas from January 2012 to March 2017. Thirty-five patients who were eligible for LDP in the ODP group were carefully selected. The clinical outcomes were compared in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS LDP was associated with significantly less operative blood loss (182 ± 232 vs. 505 ± 376 ml, P < 0.001) but a longer operation time (327 ± 89 vs. 173 ± 48 min, P < 0.001), than ODP. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the overall morbidity rates defined by Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ grade II (13% vs. 11%), clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula rates (6% vs. 9%), and lengths of postoperative hospital stay (11 vs. 11 days).

Most forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treatable, and there is consensus that the selection of antimicrobial agents is notably simplified if the pathogen is defined. The rich history of CAP studies in the prepenicillin era showed that an etiologic diagnosis was established in >90% of cases, but the 2009 data from Medicare indicate that a probable pathogen is now detected in <10% according to a review of the records of >17,000 patients hospitalized with CAP. This review addresses the issue of the state of the art of microbiological studies of CAP in terms of the realities of current-day practice. Unfortunately, the desire for better data to achieve pathogen-directed treatment clashes with a multitude of harsh realities, including cost, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements for antibiotics to be administered within 6 h of disease onset, guidelines that discourage any microbiological studies in most cases, belief in empiricism that is well supported by at least 1 prospective study, the decline of microbiological analysis standards in most laboratories, and the devastating impact of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations that led to the demise of ""the house staff laboratory"" and the distancing of microbiological analysis from the site of care. Microbiological principles are reviewed, with emphasis on specimen source, pathogenic potential of isolates, concentrations, impact of antecedent antibiotics, and the ""Washington criteria"" for expectorated sputum. The recommendation is that the high-quality microbiological analysis that is still achieved in some places should be retained but that to advance the field on the basis of the contemporary realities, two goals should be adopted: First is the broad use of antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila with interpretation by clinical staff under the CLIA waiver for low-complexity tests. The second and more ambitious recommendation is the adoption of molecular techniques, with particular emphasis on nucleic acid detection, which is rapid and sensitive and has already been developed for virtually all recognized pulmonary pathogens. This may be the ultimate solution for many laboratories, and it is likely to have selected use.","Bartlett, John G",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,256,17

Furthermore, many viruses interact with cellular membrane compartments during their replication and often induce cytoplasmic membrane structures, in which genome replication and assembly occurs. Recent studies revealed details of membrane interaction, membrane bending, fission, and fusion for a number of viruses and unraveled the lipid composition of raft-dependent and -independent viruses. Alterations of membrane lipid composition can block viral release and entry, and certain lipids act as fusion inhibitors, suggesting a potential as antiviral drugs.

OBJECTIVE To assess the visual outcomes, the obliteration rate, and the need for retreatment of OSA treated by the pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS Patients who underwent treatment with PED for OSA from 2009 to 2014 were selected and retrospectively reviewed. Patient's age, sex, mode of presentation, and aneurysm size were recorded. The complication rates, the need for retreatment (due to recurrence of the aneurysm or worsening symptoms), the aneurysm occlusion rates, the evolution of visual symptoms, and the evolution of headache/retro-orbital pain were registered. RESULTS Forty-one patients harboring 44 OSA treated by flow-diversion were identified. Females constituted 87.80% (37/41) of the cohort. The mean age was 59.16 ± 12.54 years. At final angiographic follow-up, 77.27% (34/44) had complete occlusion, 6.81% (3/44) had near-complete occlusion, and 15.90% (7/44) had incomplete occlusion. Of the 22 symptomatic OSA, complete resolution or significant improvement was noted in 72.72% (16/22), while worsening of symptoms occurred in 4.54% (1/22). Five patients out of 22 (22.72%; 5/22) had no significant changes in their symptoms. The complication rate was 2.27% (1/44). The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSION The low complication rate, the high obliteration rate, and the high rate of improvement in the visual symptoms make flow-diversion an appealing option for the treatment of OSA.","Zanaty, Mario; Chalouhi, Nohra; Barros, Guilherme; Schwartz, Eric Winthrop; Saigh, Mark Philip; Starke, Robert M; Whiting, Alex; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Hasan, David; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Neurosurgery,256,16

A járvány Európában való első megjelenése során megfigyelhető volt, hogy a terjedés mértéke kisebb azokban az országokban, ahol a tuberkulózis elleni védekezésül kiterjedt BCG-vakcinációt végeznek. Célkitűzés: A jelen munkában olyan összefüggéseket igyekeztünk feltárni, amelyek befolyásolták a járványterjedés paramétereit, különös figyelemmel a BCG-vakcinációs gyakorlatra. Módszerek: A világ összes olyan országára vonatkozóan, ahol megfelelő minőségű statisztikai adatok álltak rendelkezésünkre, vizsgáltuk a járvány terjedésének első hullámát. A mozgóátlagolt járványgörbéken elemeztük a járvány időtartamát, a tetőzés mértékét, a fertőzöttek és a halálesetek egymillió lakosra vetített számát. Figyelembe vettük az országok gazdasági mutatóit (GDP, légi forgalom, a tengeri hajózás mértéke). Statisztikai analízis: A vizsgált paraméterek nem mutattak normális eloszlást, így nemparaméteres próbákkal (rangkorreláció, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) statisztikai kapcsolatot kerestünk a járványterjedés mértéke, a BCG-vakcináció és más paraméterek között. Eredmények: A járvány gyorsan elterjedt a világon, de mégis, február első három hetében a terjedésben egy szünet volt megfigyelhető. A járványhullám Európában nagyjából egyszerre ért véget. A járvány által leginkább azok az országok érintettek, ahol nem alkalmaztak rendszeres BCG-vakcinációt, bár a képet bonyolítja, hogy ezek az országok gazdaságilag többnyire fejlettek. A halálozási rátában nem mutatkozott ilyen különbség. Következtetés: Statisztikailag igazolható tény, hogy a vakcinációt végző országokból az első hullám alatt kevesebb fertőzöttet jelentettek; az ok-okozati összefüggés bizonytalan, hiszen az országok múltja, szokásai, társadalmi berendezkedése, gazdasági fejlettsége nem azonos.

During the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe it was revealed that the rate of spread was lower in countries where extensive BCG vaccination is used to protect against tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE In the present work, we sought to explore relationships that influenced epidemic spreading parameters, with particular reference to BCG vaccination practice. METHODS We examined the first wave of the spread of the epidemic for all countries in the world where adequate quality statistics were available. We analyzed the duration of the epidemic, the extent of the peak, the number of infected people, and the number of deaths per million inhabitants with the moving average of epidemic curves. We took into account the economic indicators of the countries (GDP, air traffic and extent of maritime shipping). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The examined parameters did not show a normal distribution, so we looked for a statistical relationship with non-parametric tests (rank correlation, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) between the extents of epidemic spread, BCG vaccination and other parameters. RESULTS The epidemic spread rapidly around the world, but still, in the first three weeks of February, there was a pause in the spread. The first wave of epidemics ended roughly at the same time in Europe. Those countries are the most affected by the epidemic where regular BCG vaccination has not been used, although the picture is complicated by the fact that these countries are mostly economically developed. There was no such difference observable in the mortality rate. CONCLUSION Although this work clearly demonstrates that during the first wave of the pandemic, fewer infections were reported worldwide in countries where BCG vaccination is obligatory, however, the causal relationship is uncertain, as the countries' past, customs, social organization and economic development are different. Our results support the necessity of comparative contact tracing to clarify how BCG vaccination affects people's susceptibility to this new type of coronavirus as well as their ability to spread and transmit the virus.

Low FSE is associated with restricted activity, which putatively increases risk of future falls. However, emerging studies have failed to confirm this association. Furthermore, the interplay between age, gender, and fall history with falls has not been adequately addressed in adults aged 70 years or older. The aims of this secondary analysis were to: (1) prospectively explore the association of FSE and fall events considering age, gender, and fall history, and (2) examine the characteristics of fall events and fall-related outcomes. Forty-seven community-dwelling adults over 70 years of age were followed for about 12 months. During the follow-up, 22 participants with low FSE experienced 119 fall events whereas 25 participants with high FSE reported 106 fall events. Among fallers, 72.3% (n = 34) experienced recurrent fall events. About 15.0% (n = 34) of 225 fall events resulted in injuries and 4.0% of injuries required medical care. FSE was a statistically significant predictor of future fall events (incident rate ratio = 0.96, p = .013) regardless of age, gender, and fall history. Participants with low FSE were more likely than those with high FSE to fall more frequently without noticeable prodromal symptoms and apparent reasons. These findings suggest that FSE is an important protective factor against future fall events. However, interpretation of these results requires caution given the small sample size and effect size.","Yang, Rumei; Pepper, Ginette A",Research in nursing & health,256,1

Inhibition of the lytic replication of EBV and KSHV eliminates the reservoir of persistent infection and transmission, consequently preventing the occurrence of diseases from the sources of infection. Antiviral drugs are limited in controlling these viral infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate that niclosamide, an old anthelmintic drug, inhibits mTOR activation during EBV lytic replication. Consequently, niclosamide effectively suppresses EBV lytic gene expression, viral DNA lytic replication and virion production in EBV-infected lymphoma cells and epithelial cells. Niclosamide exhibits cytotoxicity toward lymphoma cells and induces irreversible cell cycle arrest in lytically EBV-infected cells. The ectopic overexpression of mTOR reverses the inhibition of niclosamide in EBV lytic replication. Similarly, niclosamide inhibits KSHV lytic replication. Thus, we conclude that niclosamide is a promising candidate for chemotherapy against the acute occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases of oncogenic γ-herpesviruses.","Huang, Lu; Yang, Mengtian; Yuan, Yan; Li, Xiaojuan; Kuang, Ersheng",Antiviral research,256,7

However, no consensus has been reached about the most effective intervention. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of IV tramadol versus IV paracetamol in relieving acute pain of primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital and included 100 patients between 18 and 35 years old diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea. Patients received either 1-g paracetamol or 100-mg tramadol in 100-mL normal saline as an IV infusion over 10 min. Pain intensity was measured by using a visual analog scale at 15, 30, 60 min, and 2 h. We recorded drug side effects and requirements for rescue analgesics. RESULTS Pain scores were significantly lower in the tramadol group compared with the paracetamol group at 15, 30, 60 min, and 2 h (p < 0.001). Fewer patients in the tramadol group needed rescue analgesics compared with the paracetamol group (p = 0.04). No significant differences were reported in side effects between both groups. CONCLUSIONS IV tramadol is superior to IV paracetamol in relieving acute pain of primary dysmenorrhea with a comparable side effect profile.","Ghamry, Nevein Kamal; Ali, Ahmed Said; Shareef, Mohammad Abrar; AlAmodi, Abdulhadi A; Hamza, Mohamed; Abbas, Ahmed M; Fadlalmola, Hammad Ali; Alalfy, Mahmoud; Mahmoud, Ahmed Omar; Islam, Yomna",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,256,14

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for management of individual patients as well as containment of the highly contagious disease. Having realized the clinical value of non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of COVID-19, deep learning (DL) based automated methods have been proposed to aid the radiologists in reading the huge quantities of CT exams as a result of the pandemic. In this work, we address an overlooked problem for training deep convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 classification using real-world multi-source data, namely, the data source bias problem. The data source bias problem refers to the situation in which certain sources of data comprise only a single class of data, and training with such source-biased data may make the DL models learn to distinguish data sources instead of COVID-19. To overcome this problem, we propose MIx-aNd-Interpolate (MINI), a conceptually simple, easy-to-implement, efficient yet effective training strategy. The proposed MINI approach generates volumes of the absent class by combining the samples collected from different hospitals, which enlarges the sample space of the original source-biased dataset. Experimental results on a large collection of real patient data (1,221 COVID-19 and 1,520 negative CT images, and the latter consisting of 786 community acquired pneumonia and 734 non-pneumonia) from eight hospitals and health institutions show that: 1) MINI can improve COVID-19 classification performance upon the baseline (which does not deal with the source bias), and 2) MINI is superior to competing methods in terms of the extent of improvement.","Li, Yuexiang; Chen, Jiawei; Dong, Wei; Zhu, Yanchun; Wu, Jianrong; Xiong, Junfeng; Gang, Yadong; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Haibo; Qian, Tianyi; Ma, Kai; Zheng, Yefeng",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,256,1

Photoanodes for water oxidation play the determining roles in solar water splitting, while its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the hole injection efficiency at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte. To address this problem, in this research, by employing BiVO4 as the model semiconductor for photoanodes, we develop a novel, facile, and efficient method, which simply applies K cations in the preparation process of BiVO4 photoanodes, to in situ induce a crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction by the formation of an amorphous BiVO4 layer (a-BiVO4) on the surface of the crystalline BiVO4 (c-BiVO4) film for PEC water oxidation. The K cation is the key to stimulate the formation of the heterophase, but not incorporated in the final photoelectrodes. Without sacrificing the light absorption, the in situ formed a-BiVO4 layer accelerates the kinetics of the hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, leading to the significantly increased efficiency of the surface hole injection to water molecules. Consequently, the BiVO4 photoanode with the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction (a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4) exhibits almost twice the photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for water oxidation than the bare c-BiVO4 ones. Such advantages from the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction are still effective even when the a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4 is coated by the cocatalyst of FeOOH, reflecting its broad applications in PEC devices. We believe this study can supply an efficient and simple protocol to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of photoanodes, and provide a new strategy for the potential large-scale application of the solar energy-conversion related devices.","Zhou, Dinghua; Fan, Ke; Zhuo, Qiming; Zhao, Yilong; Sun, Licheng",ACS applied materials & interfaces,256,23

Here, we identified that CXCR4 acted as an oncogene to promote cancer progression and genetically silencing of CXCR4 increased cisplatin (DDP)-sensitivity in ccRCC in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, analysis from the clinical and cellular data indicated that CXCR4 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and cells, compared to their normal counterparts. Next, the loss-of-function experiments validated that knock-down of CXCR4 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ccRCC cells, while CXCR4 overexpression had opposite effects on the above cellular functions. Consistently, the xenograft tumor-bearing mice models were established, and the results supported that knock-down of CXCR4 inhibited tumor growth and the expression levels of Ki67 protein in vivo. In addition, the ccRCC cells were exposed to DDP treatment, and we surprisingly found that upregulation of CXCR4 increased DDP-resistance in ccRCC cells, and conversely, CXCR4 ablation sensitized ccRCC cells to DDP stimulation. Taken together, we concluded that CXCR4 ablation hindered cancer progression and enhanced DDP-sensitivity in ccRCC, and the present study identified a novel therapeutic biomarker for ccRCC.","Wang, Wenguang; Gan, Zhilu; Liu, Qiang; Yan, Shenshen; Mulati, Rexiti; Wang, Yujie",Bioengineered,256,1

We hypothesized that students with depressive symptoms with SD would demonstrate a greater burden of comorbid psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment compared to students with depressive symptoms without SD. METHODS During a mental health screening, 287 undergraduate students endorsed symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] ≥ 13) and filled out the following self-report measures: demographic questionnaire, BDI, Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-intensity and frequency (ASQ), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), and the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). SD was measured using the BDI sleep item #16 dichotomized (score 0: no SD; or score > 0: some SD). RESULTS Students with depressive symptoms and SD (n = 220), compared to those without SD (n = 67), endorsed significantly more intense and frequent anxiety and poorer cognitive and physical functioning. Students with depressive symptoms with and without SD did not significantly differ in depressive severity, hopelessness, or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS College students with depressive symptoms with SD may experience a greater burden of comorbid anxiety symptoms and hyperarousal, and may have impairments in functioning, compared to students with depressive symptoms without SD.

We study the occurrence structures of nitrogenous bases and amino acids. To this aim, we devise a structural metric which could measure the structure differences for bases or amino acids. By analyzing various SARS-CoV-2 samples, we calculate the distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids. Based on the distance matrices, we find the average distance matrices for them, respectively. Then we identify the relations of all the minimal distances between bases and amino acids. The results also show that different substructures would yield much more diversified distances between amino acids.

Both clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCC) and ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (EC) may arise from endometriosis and frequently harbor mutations in the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene. We studied the influence of histological subtype on protein expression with reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and assessed proteomic changes associated with ARID1A mutation/BAF250a expression in EC and CCC. METHODS Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a expression was performed on 127 chemotherapy-naive ovarian carcinomas (33 CCC, 29 EC, and 65 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC)). Whole tumor lysates were prepared from frozen banked tumor samples and profiled by RPPA using 116 antibodies. ARID1A mutations were identified by exome sequencing, and PIK3CA mutations were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was performed to determine differential protein expression by histological subtype and ARID1A mutation status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the impact of ARID1A mutation status/BAF250a expression on AKT phosphorylation (pAKT). PIK3CA mutation type and PTEN expression were included in the model. BAF250a knockdown was performed in 3 clear cell lines using siRNA to ARID1A. RESULTS Marked differences in protein expression were observed that are driven by histotype. Compared to HGSC, SAM identified over 50 proteins that are differentially expressed in CCC and EC. These included PI3K/AKT pathway proteins, those regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, and other signaling pathways including steroid hormone signaling. Multivariate models showed that tumors with loss of BAF250a expression showed significantly higher levels of AKT-Thr308 and AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation (p < 0.05). In 31 CCC cases, pAKT was similarly significantly increased in tumors with BAF250a loss on IHC. Knockdown of BAF250a by siRNA in three CCC cell lines wild type for ARID1A showed no increase in either pAKT-Thr308 or pAKT-S473 suggesting that pAKT in tumor tissues is indirectly regulated by BAF250a expression. CONCLUSIONS Proteomic assessment of CCC and EC demonstrates remarkable differences in protein expression that are dependent on histotype, thereby further characterizing these cancers. AKT phosphorylation is associated with ARID1A/BAF250a deficient tumors, however in ovarian cancers the mechanism remains to be elucidated.","Wiegand, Kimberly C; Hennessy, Bryan T; Leung, Samuel; Wang, Yemin; Ju, Zhenlin; McGahren, Mollianne; Kalloger, Steve E; Finlayson, Sarah; Stemke-Hale, Katherine; Lu, Yiling; Zhang, Fan; Anglesio, Michael S; Gilks, Blake; Mills, Gordon B; Huntsman, David G; Carey, Mark S",BMC cancer,256,1

The disease is still not very well characterized, and factors associated with severe clinical course are not well known. METHODS The main objectives were to determine the demographic, clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with severe clinical course. We searched the PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 17, 2020, and included them if they were in English language, published in full, were retrospective or prospective observational or case control study with data on clinical, laboratory and imaging features of adult patients with COVID-19 disease from single or multiple centers. Studies that included exclusively pediatric patients were excluded. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data was displayed as n (%) or mean (SD). The meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course was performed using the random effects model, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes. FINDINGS We included 58 studies (6892 patients) for the systematic review on clinical manifestations and 21 studies (3496 patients) for meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 is 49.7±16.3 years with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. Common symptoms and their frequency are: fever (83.4%), cough (60.5%), fatigue (33.8%), sputum (28.9%), dyspnea (22.1%), myalgia (20.6%), chest tightness / pain (16.3%), sore throat (13.5%), headache (11.2%), diarhhea (7.5%), nasal congestion / rhinorrhea (6.7%), nausea / vomiting (5.6%), pain abdomen (4.6%), and hemoptysis (1.7%). The comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are: hypertension (18.4%), diabetes mellitus (9.8%), cardiovascular diseases (8.8%), endocrine diseases (5.8%), gastrointestinal diseases (5%), CLD (3%), and COPD (2.8%). Among the laboratory parameters WBC was low in 27%, high in 9%, platelets were low in 22.9%, creatinine was high in 6.5%, AST was high in 25.3%, ALT was high in 22.7%, bilirubin was high in 8.8%, albumin was low 60.1%, CT chest was abnormal in 89%, CRP was high in 67.5%, LDH was high in 52%, D-dimer was high in 34.8%, CK was high in 14.4%, and procalcitonin was high in 15.4%. Factors significantly associated severe clinical course (with their ORs) are as follows: High CRP (5.78), high procalcitonin (5.45), age >60 (4.82), dyspnea (4.66), high LDH (4.59), COPD (4.37), low albumin (4.34), high D-dimer (4.03), cardiac disease (3.88), low lymphocyte count (3.22), any associated comorbidity (3.16), diabetes mellitus (3.11), high WBC count (2.67), high bilirubin level (2.55), high creatinine (2.34), high AST (2.31), hypertension (2.30), low platelets (1.78), High ALT (1.69), high CK (1.66), fever spikes ≥39°C (1.59), diarrhea (1.55), male gender (1.47), and sputum (1.35).

The quick adoption of telemedicine occurred out of necessity for social distancing, and evidence-based approaches are needed to determine the future utility of this approach to delivering care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with both provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This survey-based study was conducted in 2020. Surveys were distributed electronically by e-mail to providers and patients. Participants: Surveys related to satisfaction levels with telemedicine were distributed to 73 primary care providers and 6,626 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measures of this study were satisfaction level with telemedicine in primary care. Results: Studies were completed by 23 primary care providers and 1,692 patients. Most patient participants were female (70.8%), white (89.7%), non-Hispanic or non-Latino (96.6%), and Massachusetts residents (96.9%). Variables that were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits included: travel time saved >30 min (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), having an easy visit connection (OR = 3.2), use of Zoom© video visit over telephone only (OR = 2.8), and identifying as female (OR 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting. Providers felt that telemedicine visits usually take the same amount or less time than in-person visits. Both providers and patients reported a desire to see telemedicine visits continued after the pandemic. Patients who saved more than 30 min of travel time found it easy to connect or those who were female were more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine visits, while those that had telephone visits were less likely to be satisfied than those that had Zoom© visits.","Vosburg, R Wesley; Robinson, Kortney A",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,256,1

To ameliorate the β-cell dysfunction, it has propelled great interest to search pharmacological agents from natural plants. This study explored the protective effect of apigetrin, a flavonoid present in natural plants, against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cell damages in RINm5F cells and the potential mechanisms. Apigetrin was found to inhibit the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, restore the impairment of antioxidant enzymes, and recover the disruption of redox homeostasis in the STZ-treated pancreatic β-cells. Moreover, treatment of apigetrin significantly suppressed the STZ-induced apoptosis in the analysis of apoptotic sub-G1 population and the protein expressions of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3. Furthermore, apigetrin attenuated STZ-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, indicated by the reduction of ER stress biomarkers, including overloading of mitochondrial calcium, increase in glucose-regulated protein 78, phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase and its downstream eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 and caspase-12, up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein, and induction of spliced X-box binding protein 1. Additionally, pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid, a classic ER stress inhibitor, augmented these beneficial effects of apigetrin. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that apigetrin could improve the STZ-induced pancreatic β-cell damages via mitigation of oxidative stress and ER stress and supported the application of apigetrin to developing the novel therapeutics of diabetes.","Zhang, Rui; Shi, Jie; Wang, Tingting; Qiu, Xiaonan; Liu, Ruixia; Li, Yitian; Gao, Qing; Wang, Ning",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a helicity-dependent photocurrent, is a notable example of a macroscopic property that emerges directly from the topology of the Weyl semimetal band structure. Recently, it was predicted that the amplitude of the CPGE associated with optical transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge. In chiral Weyl systems, nodes of opposite charge are nondegenerate, opening a window of wavelengths where the CPGE resulting from uncompensated Berry charge can emerge.

Complete occlusion or neck remnant was achieved in 264 (91.4%). Complications included rupture in 15 patients (5%), thromboembolism in 17 patients (5.7%), and early rebleeding in 3 patients (1%). Overall permanent procedural-related morbidity and mortality were seen in 12 patients (7.8%). Of the ruptured aneurysms, 189 (79.4%) had a favorable clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 4-5). A total of 33 patients (13.6%) died. On initial angiographic follow-up, aneurysm remnant was seen in 18 aneurysms (8.1%). A total of 13 patients (4.3%) were re-treated. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrates that endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms has an acceptable safety profile with low rates of technical failure and re-treatment. Therefore, coiling is acceptable as the primary treatment of MCA aneurysms.","Mortimer, A M; Bradley, M D; Mews, P; Molyneux, A J; Renowden, S A",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,256,1

Operating since 2004, it has installed long-term ecological research sites throughout Brazil and its logic has been applied in some other southern-hemisphere countries. The program supports all aspects of research necessary to understand biodiversity and the processes that affect it. There are presently 161 sampling sites (see some of them at Supplementary Appendix), most of which use a standardized methodology that allows comparisons across biomes and through time. To date, there are about 1200 publications associated with PPBio that cover topics ranging from natural history to genetics and species distributions. Most of the field data and metadata are available through PPBio web sites or DataONE. Metadata is available for researchers that intend to explore the different faces of Brazilian biodiversity spatio-temporal variation, as well as for managers intending to improve conservation strategies. The Program also fostered, directly and indirectly, local technical capacity building, and supported the training of hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students. The main challenge is maintaining the long-term funding necessary to understand biodiversity patterns and processes under pressure from global environmental changes.","Rosa, Clarissa; Baccaro, Fabricio; Cronemberger, Cecilia; Hipólito, Juliana; Barros, Claudia Franca; Rodrigues, Domingos DE Jesus; Neckel-Oliveira, Selvino; Overbeck, Gerhard E; Drechsler-Santos, Elisandro Ricardo; Anjos, Marcelo Rodrigues Dos; Ferreguetti, Átilla C; Akama, Alberto; Martins, Marlúcia Bonifácio; Tomas, Walfrido Moraes; Santos, Sandra Aparecida; Ferreira, Vanda Lúcia; Cunha, Catia Nunes DA; Penha, Jerry; Pinho, João Batista DE; Salis, Suzana Maria; Doria, Carolina Rodrigues DA Costa; Pillar, Valério D; Podgaiski, Luciana R; Menin, Marcelo; Bígio, Narcísio Costa; Aragón, Susan; Manzatto, Angelo Gilberto; Vélez-Martin, Eduardo; Silva, Ana Carolina Borges Lins E; Izzo, Thiago Junqueira; Mortati, Amanda Frederico; Giacomin, Leandro Lacerda; Almeida, Thaís Elias; André, Thiago; Silveira, Maria Aurea Pinheiro DE Almeida; Silveira, Antônio Laffayete Pires DA; Messias, Mariluce Rezende; Marques, Marcia C M; Padial, Andre Andrian; Marques, Renato; Bitar, Youszef O C; Silveira, Marcos; Morato, Elder Ferreira; Pagotto, Rubiani DE Cássia; Strussmann, Christine; Machado, Ricardo Bomfim; Aguiar, Ludmilla Moura DE Souza; Fernandes, Geraldo Wilson; Oki, Yumi; Novais, Samuel; Ferreira, Guilherme Braga; Barbosa, Flávia Rodrigues; Ochoa, Ana C; Mangione, Antonio M; Gatica, Ailin; Carrizo, María Celina; Retta, Lucía Martinez; Jofré, Laura E; Castillo, Luciana L; Neme, Andrea M; Rueda, Carla; Toledo, José Julio DE; Grelle, Carlos Eduardo Viveiros; Vale, Mariana M; Vieira, Marcus Vinicius; Cerqueira, Rui; Higashikawa, Emílio Manabu; Mendonça, Fernando Pereira DE; Guerreiro, Quêzia Leandro DE Moura; Banhos, Aureo; Hero, Jean-Marc; Koblitz, Rodrigo; Collevatti, Rosane Garcia; Silveira, Luís Fábio; Vasconcelos, Heraldo L; Vieira, Cecília Rodrigues; Colli, Guarino Rinaldi; Cechin, Sonia Zanini; Santos, Tiago Gomes Dos; Fontana, Carla S; Jarenkow, João A; Malabarba, Luiz R; Rueda, Marta P; Araujo, Publio A; Palomo, Lucas; Iturre, Marta C; Bergallo, Helena Godoy; Magnusson, William E",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,256,28

However, data in stroke patients on understanding of the informed consent (IC) procedure are sparse. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study among ischemic stroke patients taking part in the IC procedure of an ongoing cluster-randomized secondary prevention trial. All aspects of the IC procedure were assessed in an interview using a standardized 20-item questionnaire. Responses were collected within 72 hours after the IC procedure and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Participants were also asked regarding main reasons for participation. RESULTS 146 stroke patients (65±12 years, 38% female) were enrolled. On average, patients recalled 66.4% (95% CI 65.2%-67.5%) of the content of the IC procedure. Most patients understood that participation was voluntary (99.3%) and that they had the right to withdraw consent (97.1%). 79.1% of the patients recalled the study duration, 56.1% the goal. Only 40.3% could clearly state a benefit of participation and 28.8% knew their group allocation. Younger age, higher graduation and allocation to the intervention group were associated with better understanding. Of all patients, 53% exclusively stated a personal, 22% an altruistic reason for participation. CONCLUSIONS While understanding of patient rights was high, many patients were unable to recall other important aspects of study content and procedures. Increased attention to older and less educated patients may help to enhance understanding in this patient population. Actual recruitment and retention benefit of an improved IC procedure remains to be tested in a randomized trial.","Eichner, Felizitas A; Reis, Joschua M; Dores, Joaquim; Pavlovic, Vladimir; Kreß, Luisa; Daneshkhah, Naeimeh; Weinhardt, Renate; Grau, Armin; Mühler, Johannes; Soda, Hassan; Schwarzbach, Christopher J; Schuler, Michael; Haeusler, Karl Georg; Heuschmann, Peter U",European journal of neurology,256,9

Shelter-in-place rates are operationalized as the state-level percentage of users staying home. State religiosity is measured with an index of aggregated religious identities, beliefs, and practices. Population age is indicated by the state percentage of adults aged 65 years and older. We model population mobility using regression with state clustered robust SEs. Results: We observe that religious states tend to travel more during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the behavioral risks associated with state religiosity are less pronounced in states with larger older populations.

AIM OF THE STUDY A Mongolian folk medicinal plant named Thalictrum minus L. (TML) has been extensively used for the treatment of lung inflammation, bacterial and fungal infection and tuberculosis. Our present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TML against particulate matter (PM)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Initially, HPLC-Q-TOF was applied for the qualitative analysis and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis of main components in TML. Then, the mice model of ALI was induced by PM via intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/kg body weight of Standard Reference Material1648a (SRM1648a), and TML (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h prior to PM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were elucidated. RESULTS Eleven main ingredients were detected in TML and the contents of homoorientin and berberine were quantified. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TML profoundly inhibited weight loss in mice and ameliorated lung pathological injury induced by PM. Furthermore, we also found that TML significantly decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios, reduced total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively attenuated PM-induced increased leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. Meanwhile, TML could pronouncedly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues, decreased the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in BALF. In addition, TML markedly facilitated the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2 and suppressed the expression of KEAP, prohibited the activation of the MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inhibited apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION These findings indicated that TML attenuated PM-induced ALI through suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviating oxidative damage correlated with the AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways, as well as apoptotic pathways.","Badamjav, Rentsen; Zhang, Lu; Sonom, Dolgor; Wu, Yun-Hao; Kou, Jun-Ping; Yu, Bo-Yang; Li, Fang",Journal of ethnopharmacology,256,14

METHODS Standard laparoscopic technique was utilized to bilaterally implant meshes in 20 female Yorkshire pigs (n = 5 pigs/group). Meshes were fixated to the intact peritoneum with SorbaFix™ absorbable fixation devices. Mesh contracture, adhesion coverage, and adhesion tenacity were evaluated after 4 weeks. T-Peel testing and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were utilized to assess tissue ingrowth and host response. RESULTS A significantly greater percent area contracture was demonstrated for PROCEED™ (26.9%) compared to Ventrio™ ST (8.8%), Ventrio™ (14.5%) and Sepramesh™ (9.2%). Ventrio™ ST demonstrated similar adhesion area, tenacity, and tissue ingrowth compared to all other meshes. Histological scoring revealed a comparable host inflammatory response for all meshes, with a few exceptions. A greater number of giant cells were observed in Ventrio™ ST and Sepramesh™ near the multifilament polyglycolic acid (PGA) fibers; a greater number of macrophages were observed in PROCEED™ compared to Ventrio™; and a greater number of neutrophils were observed in PROCEED™, compared to Sepramesh™ (P < 0.05). Focal areas of hemorrhage were also observed on the visceral surface of PROCEED™. CONCLUSIONS Ventrio™ ST Hernia Patch demonstrated comparable contracture, adhesion, tissue ingrowth, and histologic characteristics compared to existing permanent and absorbable barrier meshes. Host inflammatory and fibrotic responses for all four meshes were minimal and representative of a biocompatible response.","Deeken, C R; Matthews, B D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,256,1

The objectives of the study were to assess a trainees' ability to reach technical competence by assessing learning patterns of the acquisition of surgical skills. Furthermore, it aims to determine whether individuals' learning patterns were consistent across a range of open and laparoscopic tasks of variable difficulty. METHODS Sixty-five preclinical medical students participated in a training curriculum with standardized feedback over forty repetitions of the following laparoscopic and open technical tasks: peg transfer (PT), circle cutting (CC), intracorporeal knot tie (IKT), one-handed tie, and simulated laparotomy closure. Data mining techniques were used to analyze the prospectively collected data and stratify the students into four learning clusters. Performance was compared between groups, and learning curve characteristics unique to trainees who have difficulty reaching technical competence were quantified. RESULTS Top performers (22-35%) and high performers (32-42%) reached proficiency in all tasks. Moderate performers (25-37%) reached proficiency for all open tasks but not all laparoscopic tasks. Low performers (8-15%) failed to reach proficiency in four of five tasks including all laparoscopic tasks (PT 7.8%; CC 9.4%; IKT 15.6%). Participants in lower performance clusters demonstrated sustained performance disadvantage across tasks, with widely variable learning curves and no evidence of progression towards a plateau phase. CONCLUSIONS Most students reached proficiency across a range of surgical tasks, but low-performing trainees failed to reach competence in laparoscopic tasks. With increasing use of laparoscopy in surgical practice, screening potential candidates to identify the lowest performers may be beneficial.","Louridas, Marisa; Szasz, Peter; Fecso, Andras B; Zywiel, Michael G; Lak, Parisa; Bener, Ayse B; Harris, Kenneth A; Grantcharov, Teodor P",Surgical endoscopy,256,1

METHODS This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial in Amir-Alam hospital in Tehran. Thirty adult men and women diagnosed with Covid-19 were allocated to either control group (receiving Hydroxychloroquine) or intervention group (receiving Hydroxychloroquine plus 2 grams of Docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]+ Eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) for 2 weeks. Primary outcome of the intervention including C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as well as clinical symptoms including body pain, fatigue, appetite and olfactory and secondary outcomes including liver enzymes were determined at the baseline and after omega-3 supplementation. Clinical signs were measured using self-reported questionnaires. There were commercial kits for determination of CRP and liver enzymes concentrations in the serum of patients. For determination of ESR automated hematology analyzer was applied. The study of ""Comparison of the effectiveness of omega-3 and Hydroxychloroquine on Inflammatory factors, liver enzymes and clinical symptoms in diabetic Covid-19 patients"" was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with ID number: IRCT20200511047399N1 RESULTS: In comparison to control group, patients receiving omega-3 indicated favorable changes in all clinical symptoms except for olfactory (p<0.001 for body pain and fatigue, p= 0.03 for appetite and p=0.21 for olfactory). Reducing effects of omega-3 supplementation compared to control group were also observed in the levels of ESR and CRP after treatment (p<0.001 for CRP and p=0.02 for ESR). However, no between group differences in the liver enzymes serum concentrations were observed after supplementation (p>0.05).

We assessed kidney complications among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong, including the association with risk factors, length of hospitalization, critical presentation, and mortality. METHODS Linked electronic records of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 5 major designated hospitals were extracted. Duplicated records due to interhospital transferal were removed. Primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary outcomes were AKI-associated mortality, incident renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care admission, prolonged hospitalization and disease course (defined as >90th percentile of hospitalization duration [35 days] and duration from symptom onset to discharge [43 days], respectively), and change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients were further stratified into being symptomatic or asymptomatic. RESULTS Patients were characterized by young age (median: 38.4, IQR: 28.4-55.8 years) and short time (median: 5, IQR: 2-9 days) from symptom onset to admission. Among the 591 patients, 22 (3.72%) developed AKI and 4 (0.68%) required RRT. The median time from symptom onset to in-hospital AKI was 15 days. AKI increased the odds of prolonged hospitalization and disease course by 2.0- and 3.5-folds, respectively. Estimated GFR 24 weeks post-discharge reduced by 7.51 and 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus baseline (upon admission) in the AKI and non-AKI groups, respectively. The incidence of AKI was comparable between asymptomatic (4.8%, n = 3/62) and symptomatic (3.7%, n = 19/519) patients. CONCLUSION The overall rate of AKI among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong is low, which could be attributable to a vigilant screening program and early hospitalization. Among patients who developed in-hospital AKI, the duration of hospitalization is prolonged and kidney function impairment can persist for up to 6 months post-discharge. Mass surveillance for COVID-19 is warranted in identifying asymptomatic subjects for earlier AKI management.","Chan, Kam Wa; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Wu, Tak Chiu; Tso, Eugene Yuk-Keung; Lung, Kwok Cheung; Lam, Chung Man; Chan, Gary Chi-Wang; Wong, Sunny Sze-Ho; Yu, Kam Yan; Chan, Johnny Wai-Man; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai",American journal of nephrology,256,16

Since then, new information became available. Aim The aim of the present work was to update the results of the previous systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We searched PubMed until 24 August 2016 for randomized controlled trials using the following search items: ""atrial fibrillation"" and ""anticoagulation"" and ""warfarin"" and ""previous stroke or transient ischemic attack."" Eligible studies had to be phase III trials in patients with atrial fibrillation comparing warfarin with nonvitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulants currently on the market or with the intention to be brought to the market in North America or Europe. The outcomes assessed in the efficacy analysis included stroke or systemic embolism, stroke, ischemic or unknown stroke, disabling or fatal stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular death, death from any cause, and myocardial infarction. The outcomes assessed in the safety analysis included major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and major gastrointestinal bleeding. We performed fixed effects analyses on intention-to-treat basis. Results Among 183 potentially eligible articles, four were included in the meta-analysis. In 20,500 patients, compared to warfarin, nonvitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulants were associated with a significant reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (relative risk reduction: 13.7%, absolute risk reduction: 0.78%, number needed to treat to prevent one event: 127), hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk reduction: 50.0%, absolute risk reduction: 0.63%, number needed to treat: 157), any stroke (relative risk reduction: 13.1%, absolute risk reduction: 0.7%, number needed to treat: 142), and intracranial hemorrhage (relative risk reduction: 46.1%, absolute risk reduction: 0.88%, number needed to treat: 113) over 1.8-2.8 years. Conclusions This updated meta-analysis in 20,500 atrial fibrillation patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack shows that compared to warfarin non-vitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulants are associated with a significant reduction of stroke, stroke or systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, and intracranial bleeding.","Ntaios, George; Papavasileiou, Vasileios; Diener, Hans-Chris; Makaritsis, Konstantinos; Michel, Patrik",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,256,16

Efforts to rescue and rehabilitate animals confiscated from the illegal trade are complicated by a general lack of knowledge surrounding the normal health and disease processes unique to the species. To provide clinical reference intervals for normal health states of Sunda pangolins, biochemical parameters were determined from rescued individuals in Vietnam that had undergone a 14-day observation period and met a set of criteria for release back into the wild. Blood samples were collected from 42 apparently healthy Sunda pangolins while anesthetized or awake. Packed cell volume (PCV) and total solids (TS) were determined manually, and serum biochemistry values were determined in-house with a benchtop analyzer. Additional biochemical and mineral parameters not included in the primary panel were determined from a subset of 10 pangolins through an external diagnostic laboratory. Overall reference intervals were calculated for PCV and TS (n = 29) and for standard serum biochemistry parameters (n = 42). Females and males demonstrated significant variation with respect to body mass, potassium (K+), and phosphorus, whereas age was a significant source of variation in alkaline phosphatase. Seasonal variation in glucose (GLU), creatinine (CRE), total proteins, sodium, calcium, and K+ was also observed. Comparisons between anesthetized and awake pangolins demonstrated significant variation in GLU, CRE, and K+. The parameters determined in this study can serve as a clinical reference for ex situ Sunda pangolin conservation efforts. In the context of wildlife rehabilitation, serial bloodwork allows for continued monitoring of patient health and should inform decision making regarding release readiness and timing.","Yu, Jennifer H; Huong Nguyen, Ngoc Duyen; Lam, Hai Kim; Jimerson, Jessica; Hayek, Lee-Ann C; Raphael, Bonnie L; Nguyen, Van Thai; Valitutto, Marc T",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,256,5

These methods have been engineered and employed successfully in microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, but also in higher eukaryotes. From single binary pairwise interactions to whole-genome interactome mapping, the self-reassembly concept has been employed widely. Innovative studies report the use of proteins such as ubiquitin, dihydrofolate reductase, and adenylate cyclase as reconstituted reporters. Protein fragment complementation assays have extended the possibilities in protein-protein interaction studies, with technologies that enable spatial and temporal analyses of protein complexes. In addition, one-hybrid and three-hybrid systems have broadened the types of interactions that can be studied and the findings that can be obtained.

For the Wenchuan earthquake, which killed about 96,000 people and injured about 288,000, the estimation accuracy is about 77%. 242/294 (82.3%) of the medical existing institutions were severely damaged. About 40,000 tons of safe drinking water was needed every day to ensure basic living needs. The risk of water-borne and foodborne disease, respiratory and close contact transmission disease is high. For natural foci diseases, the high-risk area of schistosomiasis was mapped in Lushan County as an example. Finally, temporary settlements for victims of earthquake were mapped. Conclusions: High resolution Earth observation technology can provide a scientific basis for public health emergency management in the major disasters field, which will be of great significance in helping policy makers effectively improve health service ability and public health emergency management in prevention and control of infectious diseases and risk assessment.","Zhao, Jian; Ding, Fan; Wang, Zhe; Ren, Jinghuan; Zhao, Jing; Wang, Yeping; Tang, Xuefeng; Wang, Yong; Yao, Jianyi; Li, Qun",International journal of environmental research and public health,256,1

In both disasters, the emergency operating centers (EOCs) could not effectively integrate associated agencies to deal with the incident. The coordination and utilization of resources were inefficient, which caused difficulty in command structure operation and casualty evacuation. METHODS This study was designed to create a survey questionnaire with problem items using disaster management phases mandated by Taiwan's Emergency Medical Care Law (EMCL), use statistical methods (t test) to analyze the results and issues the EOCs encountered during the operation, and propose solutions for those problems. RESULTS Findings showed that EOCs lacked authority to intervene or coordinate with associated agencies. Also, placing emphasis on the recovery phase should improve future prevention and response mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS To improve the response to MCIs, the EMCL needs to be amended to give EOCs the lead during disasters; use feedback from the recovery phase to improve future disaster management and operation coordination; and establish an information-sharing platform across agencies to address all aspects of relief work.(Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2014;0:1-6).","Wen, Jet-Chau; Tsai, Chia-Chou; Chen, Mei-Hsuan; Chang, Wei-Ta",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,256,1

Hospitalized neonates and their mothers are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial waterborne infections. Our objectives through this systematic review were to: investigate water sources, reservoirs, and transmission routes that lead to nosocomial waterborne infections in neonates and their mothers; establish patient risk factors; compile measures for controlling outbreaks and recommended strategies for prevention; and identify information gaps to improve guidelines for reporting future outbreaks. METHODS We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov. Peer-reviewed studies reporting contaminated water as a route of transmission to neonates and/or their mothers were included. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were included. The most common contaminated water sources in healthcare facilities associated with infection transmission were tap water, sinks, and faucets. Low birthweights, preterm or premature birth, and underlying disease increased neonatal risk of infection. Effective control measures commonly included replacing or cleaning faucets and increased or alternative methods for hand disinfection, and recommendations for prevention of future infections highlighted the need for additional surveillance. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION The implementation of control measures and recommended prevention strategies by healthcare workers and managing authorities of healthcare facilities and improved reporting of future outbreaks may contribute to a reduction in the incidence of nosocomial waterborne infections in neonates and their mothers.","Moffa, Michelle; Guo, Wilson; Li, Trudy; Cronk, Ryan; Abebe, Lydia S; Bartram, Jamie",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,256,27

METHODS A multicenter retrospective cohort study of pregnant and nonpregnant women of reproductive age hospitalized between March and October 2020 in Tehran, Iran. Medical records were reviewed and women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were included. Extracted data were compared and logistic regression performed. RESULTS A total of 110 pregnant and 234 nonpregnant COVID-19-positive women were included. Frequency of severe disease was higher in nonpregnant women than pregnant women (29% vs 11.8%; P < 0.001). Symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chill, fatigue, and headache were more frequent in nonpregnant women (P < 0.05). Pregnant women had higher oxygen saturation levels and lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.001). Six (5.5%) pregnant and 12 (5.1%) nonpregnant women died (P = 0.80). No significant differences between the groups were found for ICU admission and end organ failure. Significantly more nonpregnant women had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 9.4% vs 0%; P = 0.001). Univariate regression indicated association between hypertension and death; oxygen saturation and ARDS; and body mass index and ICU admission. No association was found between pregnancy and death, ICU admission, or ARDS.

Review of a random sample of trials.,15.182713,7.090404,2020-05-05,"Micro-electrolysis is a cost-effective method widely applied in wastewater treatment. In this paper, a high-efficiency micro-electrolysis filler was prepared by a facile calcination method for the degradation of isobutyl xanthate (IBX). The optimization of filler fabrication process was investigated from aspects of compressive strength, abrasion loss and degradation rate. Combined with multi-characterization techniques, it can be found that the zero-valent iron (ZVI) was partially changed to Fe(2+) in the phase of fayalite (Fe2SiO4) during the treatment. The influence of operation parameters of filler dosage, initial pH and initial concentration were thoroughly studied. The result shows that the IBX degradation rate by optimized filler can reach 93.30%, superior to that of Fe/C filler (the element Fe kept at ZVI during heat treatment) with 61.8% removal. The degradation pathway of IBX was studied by GC-MS in details and the bis(2-methylpropyl)carbonate was postulated as the main by-product. The stability of filler was evaluated by batch cycle tests and column tests. This work provides a novel perspective about micro-electrolysis filler preparation. The extraordinary performance brings it potential for industrial application.","Yang, Shuzhen; Sun, Huina; Su, Shengpeng; Han, Guihong; Huang, Yanfang",Journal of hazardous materials,256,19

METHODS We compared functional and quality-of-life outcomes at 12 months overall and by stroke severity in stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by endovascular treatment as compared with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone in the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial. The key outcome measures were a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 (functional independence) and the Euro-QoL EQ-5D, a health-related quality-of-life measure. RESULTS 656 subjects with moderate-to-severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥8) were enrolled at 58 centers in the United States (41 sites), Canada (7), Australia (4), and Europe (6). There was an interaction between treatment group and stroke severity in the repeated measures analysis of modified Rankin Scale ≤2 outcome (P=0.039). In the 204 participants with severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥20), a greater proportion of the endovascular group had a modified Rankin Scale ≤2 (32.5%) at 12 months as compared with the intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator group (18.6%, P=0.037); no difference was seen for the 452 participants with moderately severe strokes (55.6% versus 57.7%). In participants with severe stroke, the endovascular group had 35.2 (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 73.3) more quality-adjusted-days over 12 months as compared with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone.

Traditional culture techniques take time that may delay treatment. We hypothesized that a rapid multiplex molecular assay could improve time to diagnosis and appropriate clinical decision making. METHODS In a prospective observational study of recipients undergoing bronchoscopy, we assessed the BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel (BFPP) in parallel to standard of care (SOC) diagnostics. Research clinicians performed shadow (research only) clinical decision making in real time. Time to report and interpretation were reported as median and interquartile ranges and compared by Wilcoxon signed-ranked test. Agreement was defined based on detection of any species targeted in the molecular assay. RESULTS For the 150 enrolled subjects, BFPP results were available 3.8 hours (IQR 2.8-5.1) following bronchoscopy, compared to 13 hours for viral SOC (IQR 10-34, P <0.001) results and 48 hours for bacterial SOC (IQR 46-70, P <0.001) results. Positive BFPP were interpreted in 9 hours (IQR 5-20) following bronchoscopy, compared to 74 hours for SOC (IQR 37-110, P <0.001). Assays agreed for 138 (92%) of the 150 subjects. Of 22 BFPP diagnoses, 5 (23%) resulted in a shadow antibiotic recommendation. Notable BFPP deficiencies included fungal species and H. parainfluenzae, accounting for 15 (27%) and 13 (23%) of the 56 actionable SOC results, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This molecular diagnostic including bacterial targets has the potential to shorten time to diagnosis and augment current clinical decision making but cannot replace SOC culture methods.","Hoover, Jonathan; Mintz, Michelle A; Deiter, Fred; Aminian, Emily; Chen, Joy; Hays, Steven R; Singer, Jonathan P; Calabrese, Daniel R; Kukreja, Jasleen; Greenland, John R",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,256,22

Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional DCs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127HI/KLRG-1LO, OX40+veCD62L+ve and mucosally imprinted CD69+veCD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2.ImportanceWhile antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses, such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Woojong; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Kedl, Ross M; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Suresh, M",Journal of virology,256,1

This review aimed to evaluate what is known about physical functional limitations and physical activity levels, and how these constructs are measured in adults experiencing homelessness. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews. Suitable quantitative and qualitative articles were searched using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings and a grey literature search was also performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were studies that examined physical functional limitations and/or physical activity among homeless adults (with/without co-occurring mental illness, infectious disease, substance use disorder), as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Results: We identified 15 studies for inclusion including 2,018 participants. Studies were primarily quantitative (n=11) and there were 4 qualitative studies. The following physical focused measures were evaluated across studies; mobility levels (n=2), frailty (n=1), flexibility (n=2), strength (n=1), physical symptom burden (n=3), physical activity levels (n=6) and exercise capacity (n=3). The majority of studies reported high levels of functional limitations among participants and low physical activity levels although a spectrum of abilities was noted. Conclusion: This review showed that many adults who are homeless appear to show a high burden of physical functional limitations and low physical activity levels but more objective and consistent measures should be applied to examine these factors in future studies. This will help address and plan future care, physical rehabilitation and housing needs for this vulnerable cohort. This scoping review will help direct research and future systematic reviews in this emerging area.","Kiernan, Sinéad; Mockler, David; Ní Cheallaigh, Clíona; Broderick, Julie",HRB open research,256,17

Improvement in periprocedural stroke rates from angioplasty and stenting for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) requires an understanding of the mechanisms of these events. OBJECTIVE To identify the types and mechanisms of periprocedural stroke after angioplasty and stenting for ICAD. METHODS Patients who experienced a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or a cerebral infarct with temporary signs within 30 days of attempted angioplasty and stenting in SAMMPRIS were identified. Study records, including case report forms, procedure notes, and imaging were reviewed. Strokes were categorized as ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes were categorized as perforator territory, distal embolic, or delayed stent thrombosis. Hemorrhagic strokes were categorized as subarachnoid or intraparenchymal. Causes of hemorrhage (wire perforation, vessel rupture) were recorded. RESULTS Three patients had an ischemic stroke after diagnostic angiography. Two of these strokes were unrelated to the procedure. Twenty-one patients had an ischemic stroke (n = 19) or cerebral infarct with temporary signs (n = 2) within 30 days of angioplasty and stenting. Most (n = 15) were perforator territory and many of these occurred after angiographically successful angioplasty and stenting of the basilar artery (n = 8). Six patients experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage (3 from wire perforation) and 7 had a delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CONCLUSION Efforts at reducing complications from angioplasty and stenting for ICAD must focus on reducing the risks of regional perforator infarction, delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and wire perforation.","Derdeyn, Colin P; Fiorella, David; Lynn, Michael J; Rumboldt, Zoran; Cloft, Harry J; Gibson, Daniel; Turan, Tanya N; Lane, Bethany F; Janis, L Scott; Chimowitz, Marc I",Neurosurgery,256,17

For the last ten years, pilgrims are being recommended to take influenza vaccine before attending Hajj. Vaccination coverage has increased in recent years, but whether there has been any change in the prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) is not known. In this analysis, we examined the changes in the rate of ILI against seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade. METHOD Data for this analysis is a synthesis of raw and published data from eleven Hajj seasons between 2005 and 214. For seven Hajj seasons the data were obtained from studies involving pilgrims of UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia; and for the remaining four Hajj seasons data were abstracted from published studies involving pilgrims from multiple countries. The data from both sources were synthesised to estimate the relative risk (RR) of acquisition of ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated pilgrims. RESULTS The pooled sample size of the included studies was 33,213 with most pilgrims being in the age band of 40-60 years (range: 0.5 to 95 years) and a male to female ratio of 1.6. The pilgrims originated, in order of frequency, from Iran, Australia, France, UK, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, India, Algeria, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Somalia, Turkey, Syria, Sierra Leone and USA. Except for one year (2008), data from individual years did not demonstrate a noticeable change in the rate of ILI against influenza vaccine coverage, however the combined data from all studies suggest that the prevalence of ILI decreased among Hajj pilgrims as the vaccine coverage increased over the last decade (RR 0.2, P<0.01). CONCLUSION This analysis suggests that influenza vaccine might be beneficial for Hajj pilgrims. However, controlled trials aided by molecular diagnostic tools could confirm whether such an effect is real or ostensible.","Alfelali, Mohammad; Barasheed, Osamah; Tashani, Mohamed; Azeem, Mohammad Irfan; El Bashir, Haitham; Memish, Ziad A; Heron, Leon; Khandaker, Gulam; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor",Vaccine,256,26

When COVID-19 is severe, it can cause pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and can progress to viremia involving multiple organ systems. It causes significant cytopenia, mainly severe lymphopenia, and excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in an immunocompromised state and cytokine storm. Furthermore, COVID-19 can commonly be complicated with acute thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism, acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, clotting of hemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) catheters, and acute limb ischemia. This makes SARS-COV-2 a unique virus with an undiscovered pathophysiology.

Compared with patients with late percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, patients with early percutaneous dilational tracheostomy had higher discontinuation rates from mechanical ventilation (absolute difference 7%; p < 0.35; hazard ratio for successful discontinuation, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.3; p = 0.04) and had a shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (absolute difference, -15 d; p < 0.001). None of the healthcare providers who performed all the percutaneous dilational tracheostomies procedures had clinical symptoms or any positive laboratory test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. CONCLUSIONS In coronavirus disease 2019 patients on mechanical ventilation, an early modified percutaneous dilational tracheostomy was safe for patients and healthcare providers and associated with improved clinical outcomes.","Angel, Luis F; Amoroso, Nancy E; Rafeq, Samaan; Mitzman, Brian; Goldenberg, Ronald; Shekar, Saketh Palasamudram; Troxel, Andrea B; Zhang, Yan; Chang, Stephanie H; Kwak, Paul; Amin, Milan R; Sureau, Kimberly; Nafday, Heidi B; Thomas, Sarun; Kon, Zachary; Sommer, Philip M; Segal, Leopoldo N; Moore, William H; Cerfolio, Robert",Critical care medicine,256,1

GJ proteins, connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 47 (Cx47), play a crucial role in production and maintenance of CNS myelin. Cx43 is mainly expressed by astrocytes in the CNS and forms gap junction intercellular communications between astrocytes-astrocytes (Cx43-Cx43) and between astrocytes-oligodendrocytes (Cx43-Cx47). Mutations of these connexin (Cx) proteins cause dysmyelinating diseases in humans. Previously, it has been shown that Cx43 localization and expression is altered due to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 infection both in vivo and in vitro; however, its mechanism and association with loss of myelin protein was not elaborated. Thus, we explored potential mechanisms by which MHV-A59 infection alters Cx43 localization and examined the effects of viral infection on Cx47 expression and its association with loss of the myelin marker proteolipid protein. Immunofluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy confirmed that MHV-A59 used microtubules (MTs) as a conduit to reach the cell surface and restricted MT-mediated Cx43 delivery to the cell membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Cx43-β-tubulin molecular interaction was depleted due to protein-protein interaction between viral particles and MTs. During acute MHV-A59 infection, oligodendrocytic Cx47, which is mainly stabilized by Cx43 in vivo, was down-regulated, and its characteristic staining remained disrupted even at chronic phase. The loss of Cx47 was associated with loss of proteolipid protein at the chronic stage of MHV-A59 infection.","Basu, Rahul; Bose, Abhishek; Thomas, Deepthi; Das Sarma, Jayasri",The Journal of biological chemistry,256,31

However, due to the multiple compounds in RRL, the underlying molecular mechanisms of RRL are remained unclear. To decipher the action mechanisms of RRL from a systematic perspective, a systems pharmacology approach integrated absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) system, drug targeting, and network analysis was introduced. First, by the ADME screening system and the target fishing process, 56 potential active compounds and 62 targets were obtained, respectively. In addition, compound-target network demonstrated that most compounds interacted with multiple targets, indicating that RRL may enhance its therapeutic effects probably through hitting on multiple targets in a holistic level. Moreover, target-pathway network and gene ontology analysis showed that multiple targets of RRL were involved in several biological pathways, i.e. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and VEGF signaling pathway, which dissecting the therapeutic effects of RRL on various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, depression, adaptation diseases, etc. In summary, this work successfully explains the potential active compounds and the multi-scale curative action mechanisms of RRL for treating various diseases; meanwhile, it implies that RRL could be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in arthritic diseases. Most importantly, this work provides an in silico strategy to understand the action mechanisms of herbal medicines from molecular/system levels, which will promote the new drug development of traditional Chinese medicine.","Zhang, Wenjuan; Huai, Ying; Miao, Zhiping; Chen, Chu; Shahen, Mohamed; Rahman, Siddiq Ur; Alagawany, Mahmoud; El-Hack, Mohamed E Abd; Zhao, Heping; Qian, Airong",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,256,17

We aimed to develop and validate a new pre-endoscopy score for predicting mortality in both UGIB and LGIB. DESIGN AND SETTING International cohort study. Patients presenting to hospital with UGIB at six international centres were used to develop a risk score for predicting mortality using regression analyses. The score's performance in UGIB and LGIB was externally validated and compared with existing scores using four international datasets. We calculated areas under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs), sensitivities, specificities and outcome among patients classified as low risk and high risk. PARTICIPANTS AND RESULTS We included 3012 UGIB patients in the development cohort, and 4019 UGIB and 2336 LGIB patients in the validation cohorts. Age, Blood tests and Comorbidities (ABC) score was closer associated with mortality in UGIB and LGIB (AUROCs: 0.81-84) than existing scores (AUROCs: 0.65-0.75; p≤0.02). In UGIB, patients with low ABC score (≤3), medium ABC score (4-7) and high ABC score (≥8) had 30-day mortality rates of 1.0%, 7.0% and 25%, respectively. Patients classified low risk using ABC score had lower mortality than those classified low risk with AIMS65 (threshold ≤1) (1.0 vs 4.5%; p<0.001). In LGIB, patients with low, medium and high ABC scores had in-hospital mortality rates of 0.6%, 6.3% and 18%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to previous scores, ABC score has good performance for predicting mortality in both UGIB and LGIB, allowing early identification and targeted management of patients at high or low risk of death.","Laursen, Stig Borbjerg; Oakland, Kathryn; Laine, Loren; Bieber, Vered; Marmo, Riccardo; Redondo-Cerezo, Eduardo; Dalton, Harry R; Ngu, Jeffrey; Schultz, Michael; Soncini, Marco; Gralnek, Ian; Jairath, Vipul; Murray, Iain A; Stanley, Adrian J",Gut,256,31

Viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to modulate host IFN-mediated immune responses. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) US3, a Ser/Thr kinase conserved in alphaherpesviruses, was previously reported to counteract host innate immunity; however, the molecular mechanism is elusive. In this study, we report that US3 blocks IFN-β production by hyperphosphorylating IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Ectopic expression of US3 protein significantly inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-mediated activation of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoters and the transcription of IFN-β, ISG54, and ISG56. US3 was also shown to block SeV-induced dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3. The kinase activity was indispensable for its inhibitory function, as kinase-dead (KD) US3 mutants K220M and D305A could not inhibit IFN-β production. Furthermore, US3 interacted with and hyperphosphorylated IRF3 at Ser175 to prevent IRF3 activation. Finally, the US3 KD mutant viruses were constructed and denoted K220M or D305A HSV-1, respectively. Cells and mice infected with both mutant viruses produced remarkably larger amounts of IFN-β than those infected with wild-type HSV-1. For the first time, these findings provide convincing evidence that US3 hyperphosphorylates IRF3, blocks the production of IFN-β, and subverts host innate immunity.","Wang, Shuai; Wang, Kezhen; Lin, Rongtuan; Zheng, Chunfu",Journal of virology,256,30

At the same time, other respiratory viruses circulate and cause respiratory illness with influenza-like symptoms. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) and human metapneumovirus have all been associated with morbidity and mortality in adults, including nosocomial infections. This study evaluated 154 respiratory specimens collected from adults with influenza-like/acute respiratory illness (ILI) seen at the Edward Hines Jr VA Hospital, Hines, IL, USA, during two successive winters, 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. The samples were tested for ten viruses in two nested multiplex RT-PCRs. One to three respiratory viruses were detected in 68 % of the samples. As expected, influenza A virus (FLU-A) infections were most common (50 % of the samples), followed by HRSV-A (16 %). Surprisingly, HPIV-4 infections (5.8 %) were the third most prevalent. Mixed infections were also relatively common (11 %). When present, HPIV infections were approximately three times more likely to be included in a mixed infection than FLU-A or HRSV. Mixed infections and HPIV-4 are likely to be missed using rapid diagnostic tests. This study confirms that ILI in adults and the elderly can be caused by HRSV and HPIVs, including HPIV-4, which co-circulate with FLU-A.","Hasman, Hatice; Pachucki, Constance T; Unal, Arife; Nguyen, Diep; Devlin, Troy; Peeples, Mark E; Kwilas, Steven A",Journal of medical microbiology,256,1

Dystonia is a poorly understood neurological movement disorder, often presenting in an idiopathic, isolated form across different parts of the body. The neurophysiological profile of isolated dystonia compared to healthy adults remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of neurophysiologic TMS measures in people with isolated dystonia to provide a synthesized understanding of cortical neurophysiology associated with isolated dystonia. We performed a systematic database search and data was extracted independently by the two authors. Separate meta-analyses were performed for TMS measures of: motor threshold, corticomotor excitability, short interval intracortical inhibition, cortical silent period, intracortical facilitation and afferent-induced inhibition. Standardised mean differences were calculated using a random effects model to determine overall effect sizes and confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was explored using dystonia type subgroup analysis. The search resulted in 78 studies meeting inclusion criteria, of these 57 studies reported data in participants with focal hand dystonia, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm or spasmodic dysphonia, and were included in at least one meta-analysis. The cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition and afferent-induced inhibition was found to be reduced in isolated dystonia compared to controls. Reduced GABAergic-mediated inhibition in the primary motor cortex in idiopathic isolated dystonia's suggest interventions targeted to aberrant cortical disinhibition could provide a novel treatment. Future meta-analyses require neurophysiology studies to use homogeneous cohorts of isolated dystonia participants, publish raw data values, and record electromyographic responses from dystonic musculature where possible.","McCambridge, Alana B; Bradnam, Lynley V",The European journal of neuroscience,256,20

RESULTS Current options for surgeons looking to train in uVATS range from videos on the internet, through 'experts' demonstrating live surgery, to symposia and hands-on wet labs being held in all regions of the world. All have merits, and the aspiring VATS surgeon can choose from a range of preceptorship and proctorship modules to suit his/her own training needs. However, issues in the formalizing training in uVATS remains unresolved. Is there an ideal pathway through uVATS training?

METHODS This single-center prospective study enrolled all patients undergoing double-stapled colorectal anastomosis between December 2012 and December 2015. Maximal diameter and minimal and maximal heights and widths of both colonic and rectal doughnuts were measured by surgeons in the operating room. Their influence on the risk of AL was analyzed on uni- and multivariate models. RESULTS One hundred fifty-four patients were included; 92 (59.7%) were operated on for malignancy. Colorectal anastomoses > and <10 cm above the anal verge were performed in 96 (62.3%) and 58 (37.7%) patients, respectively. AL occurred in 17 (11.0%). The minimal height of the colonic doughnut (CD) was the only measurement significantly associated with an increased risk of AL (p = 0.026). A cutoff value of 4.5 mm for the CD determined on the ROC curve (AUC 0.685, p = 0.013) yielded the best sensitivity (61.4%) and specificity (82.4%) to predict AL. On multivariate analysis, a height of the CD <4.5 mm (OR 5.743, 95% IC 1.476-22.346, p = 0.012), malignant disease (OR 8.821, 95% IC 1.051-74.006, p = 0.045), and American Society of Anesthesiologists score >2 (OR 3.408, 95% IC 1.017-11.418, p = 0.047) were the only independent risk factors of AL. CONCLUSION The CD's minimal height influences the risk of AL. Its routine measurement during operation, along with other risk factors, could help to decide which patients could benefit from a diverting stoma or the creation of a new anastomosis.","Cauchy, François; Abdalla, Solafah; Penna, Christophe; Angliviel, Benjamin; Lambert, Benoit; Costaglioli, Bruno; Brouquet, Antoine; Benoist, Stéphane",International journal of colorectal disease,256,24

We explored the literature on fitness-to-fly to obtain a pragmatic assessment of the challenges for aeromedical examinations.

The INS convened an international committee of experts in the field to explore the evidence and clinical experience regarding safety, risks, and steps to risk reduction to improve outcomes. METHODS The Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee (NACC) reviewed the world literature in English by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar to evaluate the evidence for ways to reduce risks of neurostimulation therapies. This evidence, obtained from the relevant literature, and clinical experience obtained from the convened consensus panel were used to make final recommendations on improving safety and reducing risks. RESULTS The NACC determined that the ability to reduce risk associated with the use of neurostimulation devices is a valuable goal and possible with best practice. The NACC has recommended several practice modifications that will lead to improved care. The NACC also sets out the minimum training standards necessary to become an implanting physician. CONCLUSIONS The NACC has identified the possibility of improving patient care and safety through practice modification.

During NPT-anaesthesia, gas insufflation provides some positive oropharyngeal pressure that differs from the proximal airway pressure (Paw) owing to the flow-dependent pressure drop across the NPT (ΔPNPT ). AIMS This study aimed to investigate whether ΔPNPT could be used for calculating oropharyngeal pressure during NPT-assisted anaesthesia. METHODS In a physical model of NPT-anaesthesia, using Rohrer's equation, we calculated ΔPNPT for three NPTs (3.5, 4.0, and 5.0, mm inner diameter) under oxygen and several sevoflurane in oxygen combinations in two ventilatory scenarios (continuous positive airway pressure and intermittent positive pressure ventilation). We then calculated oropharyngeal pressure as Paw minus ΔPNPT . Calculated and measured oropharyngeal pressure couples of values were compared with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) to assess accuracy. We also investigated whether oropharyngeal pressure accuracy depends on the NPT diameter, flow rate, gas composition, and leak size. Using ΔPNPT charts, we tested whether ΔPNPT calculation was feasible in clinical practice. RESULTS When we tested small-diameter NPTs at high flow or high peak inspiratory pressure, Paw measurements markedly overestimated oropharyngeal pressure. Comparing measured and calculated maximum and minimum oropharyngeal pressure couples yielded RMSDs less than 0.5 cmH2 O regardless of ventilatory modality, NPT diameter, flow rate, gas composition, and leak size. CONCLUSION During NPT-assisted anaesthesia, Paw readings on the anaesthetic monitoring machine overestimate oropharyngeal pressure especially for smaller-diameter NPTs and higher flow, and to a lesser extent for large leaks. Given the importance of calculating oropharyngeal pressure in guiding NPT-ventilation in clinical practice, we propose an accurate calculation using Rohrer's equation method, or approximating oropharyngeal pressure from flow and pressure readings on the anaesthetic machine using the ΔPNPT charts.","Papoff, Paola; Rosini, Talitha; Oliva, Salvatore; Luciani, Stefano; Midulla, Fabio; Montecchia, Francesco",Paediatric anaesthesia,256,1

We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic Covid-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption. METHODS We analyzed placenta for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy, and we measured the maternal antibody response in blood to this infection. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. CONCLUSION This case demonstrates SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.","Hosier, Hillary; Farhadian, Shelli F; Morotti, Raffaella A; Deshmukh, Uma; Lu-Culligan, Alice; Campbell, Katherine H; Yasumoto, Yuki; Vogels, Chantal Bf; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Vijayakumar, Pavithra; Geng, Bertie; Odio, Camila D; Fournier, John; Brito, Anderson F; Fauver, Joseph R; Liu, Feimei; Alpert, Tara; Tal, Reshef; Szigeti-Buck, Klara; Perincheri, Sudhir; Larsen, Christopher P; Gariepy, Aileen M; Aguilar, Gabriela; Fardelmann, Kristen L; Harigopal, Malini; Taylor, Hugh S; Pettker, Christian M; Wyllie, Anne L; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Ring, Aaron M; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Ko, Albert I; Horvath, Tamas L; Iwasaki, Akiko; Reddy, Uma M; Lipkind, Heather S",The Journal of clinical investigation,256,9

The aim of this study was to identify viruses in children hospitalized for ALRIs and to demonstrate epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in Japan. METHODS During a 2-year period from February 2013 to January 2015, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from almost all hospitalized children with ALRIs in Nagasaki, a regional city of Japan, and its environs. Viruses were detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from these samples. RESULTS We detected one or more viruses from 259 (69%) of 374 patients, 227 of whom were infected with a single virus, 30 with 2, and 2 with 3 viruses. Detected viruses in this study were rhinovirus (46.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), human metapneumovirus (6.8%), parainfluenza virus (5.5%), enterovirus D68 (3.4%), influenza virus (2.7%), adenovirus (2.4%), bocavirus (2.0%) and Coxsackie virus (1.0%). We detected a seasonal shift in respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks from the 2013-2014 to the 2014-2015 seasons. There was no significant difference in clinical course and severity among those viruses. Patients with a history of asthma or underlying diseases were older and more frequently required oxygen therapy than previously healthy patients. CONCLUSIONS Viral etiology in hospitalized children with ALRIs in Nagasaki, Japan, was similar to that in many other countries. Enterovirus D68, which was recently recognized as a causative agent of severe ALRIs, was also identified in this study area. Severity of ALRIs may depend on underlying disease rather than type of etiological virus.","Hasuwa, Tomoyuki; Kinoshita, Fumiko; Harada, Sadatomo; Nakashima, Kazuhisa; Yoshihara, Keisuke; Toku, Yuichirou; Moriuchi, Hiroyuki; Yoshida, Lay Myint",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,256,31

Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with vaccination willingness and acceptance.Results: A total of 983 questionnaires were included and 81.3% of the participants were willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. With a ""bachelor degree or above"" (OR = 0.56, p = 0.020) and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.50, p = 0.003) were associated with an increased willingness. Aged :30 years (OR = 0.38, p = 0.001), and believing that the vaccine would not cause SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.52, p = 0.004) were associated with higher acceptance; while from Henan province (OR = 2.49, p < 0.001), not willing to vaccinate (OR = 3.86, p < 0.001), not suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 2.25, p = 0.013), and thinking it was not safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.001) were correlated with a lower acceptance.Conclusions: In conclusion, age, education, and vaccine perception might be key factors affecting the vaccine willingness and acceptance. Triggering positive perception of vaccine, especially by targeting those aged <30 years, or those with below bachelor degree, or without chronic diseases might be key approaches for improving the willingness and acceptance of vaccine in China.","Liu, Di; Luo, Lan; Xie, Fangfei; Yu, Zengli; Ma, Zheng Feei; Wang, Yun; Wan, Zhongxiao",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,256,16

The vulnerability of frail and/or seriously ill patients provides additional complexity and may deter researchers from welcoming individuals from this patient population onto their teams. The aim was to synthesize the evidence on the engagement of frail and/or seriously ill patients as research partners across the research cycle. Methods A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. A search strategy included MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO from database inception to April, 2019. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research reporting on the engagement of frail and/or seriously ill patients as partners on research teams. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to appraise study quality. Narrative analysis was conducted. Results Of 8763 citations, 30 were included. Most studies included individuals with cancer on the research team (60%). Barriers included: lack of time and resources (50%), discontinuity in contribution (37%), and concerns for well-being (33%). Facilitators included: trust and mutual respect (60%), structural accessibility (57%), flexibility in timing and methods of engagement (43%), and attention to care and comfort, (33%). Perceived impacts for patients included: renewed personal sense of agency (37%) and emotional/peer support (37%). Impacts for researchers included sensitization to the lived experience of disease (57%) and an increased appreciation of the benefits of patient engagement (23%). Research design, execution, and outcomes, developed with patients, were deemed more suitable, relevant and reflective of patients' priorities. Conclusions There is emerging evidence to suggest that research partnerships with frail and/or seriously ill patients can be achieved successfully. Patients mostly report benefit from partnering with research teams. Frailty and/or serious illness do present legitimate concerns for their well-being but appear to be successfully mitigated when researchers ensure that the purpose of engagement is well-defined, the timing and methods of engagement are flexible, and the practical and emotional needs of patient partners are addressed throughout the process.

It is important to protect them in order to reduce nosocomial transmission and maintain the assistance capacity of health systems. To evaluate the diagnostic test and retest strategy with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study carried out in a Brazilian hospital. From April 27 to June 16, 2020, symptomatic healthcare workers underwent an RT-PCR test on upper respiratory tract specimens as soon as possible and, if negative, it was repeated close to the 5th day of symptom evolution. Working areas were divided into assistance areas dedicated or not dedicated to COVID-19 and non-assistance areas. The type of activity was divided into assistance or non-assistance activity. RESULTS 775 individuals were evaluated. 114 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 101 followed the testing protocol. A second RT-PCR identified five (4.9%) of the positive cases. Working in an area dedicated to patients with COVID-19 was more prevalent among positive cases (35.1% x 19.8%, p=0.001) as well as working in an assistance activity (80.7% x 70.8%, p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS A second RT-PCR test after the 5th day of symptom evolution showed limited diagnostic improvement. The adoption of a single test-based strategy, carried out at the right time after the onset of symptoms, allows the optimal use of resources. Working in a COVID-19 dedicated area and in direct contact with patients is related to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among symptomatic healthcare workers.","Schmidt Fernandes, F; de Castro Cardoso Toniasso, S; Castelo Branco Leitune, J; Borba Brum, M C; Bielefeldt Leotti, V; Dantas Filho, F F; Martin Chaves, E B; Joveleviths, D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,256,1

Neutral amino acids are generated by a variety of aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases and are subsequently taken up by the amino acid transporter B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19), which is mutated in Hartnup disorder. Coexpression of B(0)AT1 together with the brush-border carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in Xenopus laevis oocytes led to a dramatic increase of transporter expression at the oocyte surface. Other members of the SLC6 family were not stimulated by coexpression with ACE2. Addition of a peptide containing a carboxyterminal leucine residue to ACE2- and B(0)AT1-coexpressing oocytes caused inward currents due to Na(+)-leucine cotransport, demonstrating the formation of a metabolic complex. Coexpression of the Hartnup disorder causing mutation B(0)AT1(R240Q) showed reduced interaction with ACE2 and its renal paralogue collectrin. This would result in reduced surface expression in both kidney and intestine, thereby explaining the onset of the disorder in individuals carrying this mutation.","Kowalczuk, Sonja; Bröer, Angelika; Tietze, Nadine; Vanslambrouck, Jessica M; Rasko, John E J; Bröer, Stefan",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,256,31

A scoping review is performed in this study to assess the current applications of teleophthalmology for its suitability to diagnose, monitor or manage ophthalmological conditions with accuracy. METHODS A search of PubMed was conducted for teleophthalmology-related articles published from 1 January 2018 to 4 May 2020. Only articles that focused on the use of teleophthalmology in terms of diagnosis and management, as well as its benefits and detriments, were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the included articles. RESULTS A total of 38 articles were assessed at the full-text level. There were 2 qualitative studies and 1 quantitative randomised controlled trial, while the majority were either quantitative descriptive studies (19, 50.0%) or quantitative non-randomised studies (16, 42.1%). Overall, 8 studies described reducing manpower requirements, 4 described reducing direct patient-doctor contact, 17 described storage of medical imaging and clinical data, and 9 described real-time teleconferencing.

This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVID-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6. The binding of COVID-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1b which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1b which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Ra receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1β, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1b by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by COVID-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1b and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by COVID-19, providing a new relevant strategy.","Conti, P; Ronconi, G; Caraffa, A; Gallenga, C; Ross, R; Frydas, I; Kritas, S",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,256,26

Coronaviruses are important causes of respiratory tract infections, ranging from mild to severe depending on the viral strain. This study evaluated the role of PMN during a non-fatal pulmonary coronavirus infection in the natural host. Rat coronavirus (RCoV) causes respiratory disease in adult rats, characterized by an early PMN response, viral replication and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, mild weight loss and effective resolution of infection. To determine their role during RCoV infection, PMN were depleted and the effects on disease progression, viral replication, inflammatory response and lung pathology were analysed. Compared with RCoV infection in control animals, PMN-depleted rats had worsened disease with weight loss, clinical signs, mortality and prolonged pulmonary viral replication. PMN-depleted animals had fewer macrophages and lymphocytes in the respiratory tract, corresponding to lower chemokine levels. Combined with in vitro experiments showing that PMN express cytokines and chemokines in response to RCoV-infected alveolar epithelial cells, these findings support a role for PMN in eliciting an inflammatory response to RCoV infection. Despite their critical role in the protection from severe disease, the presence of PMN was correlated with haemorrhagic lesions, epithelial barrier permeability and cellular inflammation in the lungs. This study demonstrated that while PMN are required for an effective antiviral response, they also contribute to lung pathology during RCoV infection.","Haick, Anoria K; Rzepka, Joanna P; Brandon, Elizabeth; Balemba, Onesmo B; Miura, Tanya A",The Journal of general virology,256,1

The aim of the current study was to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a new technique using a pure endoscopic approach and tissue-apposing stent placement for gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, experimental study on six live pigs weighing 20 - 45 kg. Endoscopies were performed using a double-channel gastroscope, and included the creation of a GJA using a tissue-apposing, fully covered, self-expanding metallic stent. Antibiotic therapy was continued for 7 days after the procedure, and food was gradually reintroduced from Day 3. Changes in weight following the procedure were compared with a control group of age-matched animals. Anastomosis functionality was confirmed by endoscopy at 3 weeks (before the animals were euthanized), and during histopathological analysis. The primary outcomes were morbidity and mortality at 3 weeks. Secondary outcomes were technical feasibility, procedure time, and patency of the GJA. RESULTS The procedures were performed successfully in all animals. The mean procedure time was 26 ± 6.7 minutes (range 15 - 32 minutes). One case of stent migration occurred during the procedure; the stent was successfully replaced using the same procedure. All animals were alive after 3 weeks. The mean weight gain during follow-up was 0.85 ± 2.56 kg (range - 2 to + 2 kg) compared with 5.2 ± 1.6 kg (range 3 - 7 kg) in control animals (P = 0.007). At necropsy, the stents were still in place in all animals, without evidence of peritonitis. Histopathology confirmed permeable anastomoses with continuity of the mucosa and mucosa muscle layers. CONCLUSIONS GJA with a tissue-apposing stent is safe, feasible, and reproducible without anastomotic leakage in a porcine model using a pure endoscopic approach and standard endoscopic equipment.","Vanbiervliet, Geoffroy; Bonin, Eduardo Aimore; Garcès, Rodrigo; Gonzalez, Jean-Michel; Garnier, Emmanuelle; Paul, Marie Christine Saint; Berdah, Stéphane; Barthet, Marc",Endoscopy,256,5

CPAP is a method of treatment that helps maintain lung volume during expiration, promotes comfortable breathing, and improves oxygenation. Bubble CPAP is an effective alternative to standard CPAP. We sought to determine the reliability and functionality of a low-cost bubble CPAP device designed for low-resource settings. METHODS The low-cost bubble CPAP device was compared to a commercially available bubble CPAP system. The devices were connected to a lung simulator that simulated neonates of 4 different weights with compromised respiratory mechanics (∼1, ∼3, ∼5, and ∼10 kg). The devices' abilities to establish and maintain pressure and flow under normal conditions as well as under conditions of leak were compared. Multiple combinations of pressure levels (5, 8, and 10 cm H2O) and flow levels (3, 6, and 10 L/min) were tested. The endurance of both devices was also tested by running the systems continuously for 8 h and measuring the changes in pressure and flow. RESULTS Both devices performed equivalently during the no-leak and leak trials. While our testing revealed individual differences that were statistically significant and clinically important (>10% difference) within specific CPAP and flow-level settings, no overall comparisons of CPAP or flow were both statistically significant and clinically important. Each device delivered pressures similar to the desired pressures, although the flows delivered by both machines were lower than the set flows in most trials. During the endurance trials, the low-cost device was marginally better at maintaining pressure, while the commercially available device was better at maintaining flow. CONCLUSIONS The low-cost bubble CPAP device evaluated in this study is comparable to a bubble CPAP system used in developed settings.

There is strong evidence that acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), likely triggered by a cytokine storm, is responsible for the severity of disease seen in COVID-19 patients. In support of this hypothesis, pilot studies using IL-6 receptor inhibitors such as tocilizumab have shown promising results. Therefore, the use of drugs or cocktails of drugs with broader ability to inhibit these cytokine receptors is likely to be effective. In this article, we propose the use of sphingosine analogues, which have been shown to mitigate acute lung damage in animal models of ALI/ARDS, as early adjuvant therapies to prevent and/or mitigate the cytokine response in COVID-19 patients. This proposal is based on the ability of these drugs to decrease the production of IL-6 and other cytokines. The potential application of fingolimod (FTY720), the oldest sphingosine analogue approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, in the early stages of COVID-19 is discussed in more detail as a prototype drug.","Tasat, Deborah R; Yakisich, Juan S",Clinical medicine,256,1

Here we identify novel variants and sub-types of SARS-CoV-2 by clustering sequences in adapting methods originally designed for haplotyping intra-host viral populations. We asses our results using clustering entropy — the first time it has been used in this context. Our clustering approach reaches lower entropies compared to other methods, and we are able to boost this even further through gap filling and Monte Carlo based entropy minimization. Moreover, our method clearly identifies the well-known Alpha variant in the UK and GISAID datasets, but is also able to detect the much less represented (< 1% of the sequences) Beta (South Africa), Epsilon (California), Gamma and Zeta (Brazil) variants in the GISAID dataset. Finally, we show that each variant identified has high selective fitness, based on the growth rate of its cluster over time. This demonstrates that our clustering approach is a viable alternative for detecting even rare subtypes in very large datasets.","Melnyk, Andrew; Mohebbi, Fatemeh; Knyazev, Sergey; Sahoo, Bikram; Hosseini, Roya; Skums, Pavel; Zelikovsky, Alex; Patterson, Murray",bioRxiv,256,1

His strategy of ""to make live and to let die"" found active or passive support in a significant part of Brazilian society because Bolsonaro is able to establish himself in this pole of purification and restoration of a supposedly lost-regime of truth. The research encompasses diverse textual productions and official and informal statements by the social agents in question. To analyze them, social theories, especially in sociology, were used in order to identify the agents, ideologies and discursive that produce meanings about life and death. As a result, it is possible to affirm that the government's objective of making the virus circulate, outlined as an implicit and explicit goal since the beginning of the pandemic, demanded a normalization of preventable deaths, which only the neo-fascist language, which is capable of producing an alternative meaning of life more authentic and purer, it has been able to achieve so far. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated infection prevention and control measures (curfew, quarantine, restricted travel, social distancing), represent a society-wide stressor. This study explored positive religious coping among the Muslim and Christian residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during the early stages of the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 543) completed an online survey assessing religious coping in response to the pandemic, along with symptom measures of depression, anxiety and history of psychological disorder. Muslims (N = 339) reported significantly higher levels of positive religious coping compared to their Christian counterparts (N = 204). Across the whole sample, positive religious coping was inversely related to having a history of psychological disorders. Among the Muslim cohort, positive religious coping was inversely related to depressive symptoms and having a history of psychological disorders. Positive religious coping during infectious disease outbreaks may help some individuals reduce their risk of depressive illness.

However, the acceptance of the different online meeting platforms for e-learning has been underexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors for acceptance of an online learning platform among students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 500 senior high school students voluntarily participated to answer constructs under the Extended Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM) and Delone and McLean IS Success Model. Several latent including user interface (UI), perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), information quality (IQ), system quality (SQ), behavioral intentions (BI), and actual use were analyzed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results indicated that PEU was found to have the greatest on actual use (AU), followed by UI and SQ towards PEU, which subsequently led to BI and AU. Finally, IQ was found to have a significant effect on PU, which led to BI and AU. The level of student acceptability considers the ease of use, user interface, system quality, information quality, leading to a positive behavioral intention for actual use. With that, it would be of best interest to consider the factors that would lead students towards accepting the platforms utilized and therefore the current education system.

These variations in preparedness and policy may lead to different death tolls from Covid-19 as well as from other diseases. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data to estimate the impacts of the pandemic on weekly all-cause mortality for 40 industrialised countries from mid-February 2020 through mid-February 2021, before a large segment of the population was vaccinated in any of these countries. Taken over the entire year, an estimated 1,401,900 (95% credible interval 1,259,700-1,572,500) more people died in these 40 countries than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place. This is equivalent to 140 (126-157) additional deaths per 100,000 people and a 15% (13-17) increase in deaths over this period in all of these countries combined. In Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, mortality was lower over this period than what would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred, while South Korea and Norway experienced no detectable change in mortality. In contrast, the populations of the USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced at least 20% higher mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity across countries in the dynamics of excess mortality. The first wave of the pandemic, from mid-February to the end of May 2020, accounted for over half of excess deaths in Scotland, Spain, England and Wales, Canada, Sweden, Belgium and Netherlands. At the other extreme, the period between mid-September 2020 and mid-February 2021 accounted for over 90% of excess deaths in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Until the great majority of national and global populations have vaccine-acquired immunity, minimising the death toll of the pandemic from Covid-19 and other diseases will remain dependent on actions to delay and contain infections and continue routine health and social care.","Kontis, V.; Bennett, J.

The R-number is derived from time-series of case data, using bespoke data processing to remove systematic and errors and stochastic fluctuations. In principle, growth rate can be obtained by differentiating the reported case numbers, but in fact daily stochastic fluctuations disqualify this method. We therefore assume that the case data comprises a smooth, underlying trend which is differentiable and a noise term. The approach produces, up-to-date estimates of the R-number throughout the period of data availability. Our method is validated against published consensus R-numbers from the UK government, and shown to produce comparable results. A significant advantage of our method is that it is stable up to the most recent data, this enables us to make R-number estimates available over two weeks ahead of the published consensus. The short-lived peaks observed in the R-number and case data cannot be explained by a well-mixed model and are suggestive of spread on a localised network. Such a localised spread model tends to give an Rt number close to 1, regardless of how large R0. The case-driven approach is combined with Weight-Shift-Scale (WSS) methods to monitor trends in the epidemic and for medium term predictions. Using case-fatality ratios, we create a narrative for trends in the UK epidemic increased infectiousness of the alpha and delta variants, and the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing severity of infection.","Ackland, G.

Using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) and support vector regression (SVR), active ingredients (e.g., type of alcohol) of 173 commercial and in-house products were identified and quantified regardless of the container material or opacity. Alcohol content in hand sanitizer formulations were predicted with high accuracy (R2>0.98) using SVR and 94% of the substandard test samples were identified. In sum, a SORS-SVR method was developed and used for testing medical countermeasures used against COVID-19, demonstrating a potential for high-volume testing during public health threats.By combining spatially-offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) with chemometrics, the authors demonstrate rapid, through-container analysis of commercial hand sanitizers.

Many states have introduced varying degrees of measures to prevent its spread. Most of these measures were, or still are, aimed at reducing or completely stopping the operation of shops and services, or in some cases, also the large manufacturing companies. However, as many companies have failed to cope with these restrictions, unemployment has risen in almost all EU countries. A similar situation was also observed in Slovakia, where the mentioned measures also had a significant impact on unemployment. Purpose of the article: In this study, we deal with the quantification of the impact of a pandemic, or more precisely, anti-pandemic measures, on the development of the registered unemployment rate in Slovakia. Methods: This quantification is based on the counterfactual method of before-after comparison, which is one of the most widely used methods in the field of impact assessments and brings very accurate results, based on real data. In the analysis, we use officially published data on the unemployment rate in Slovakia during the years 2013?2020 on a monthly basis. Such a long time series, using statistical methods of its decomposition and modelling of its trend, will allow predicting the development of the unemployment rate in Slovakia, assuming a counterfactual situation of no pandemic, and compare this development with the actual situation that occurred during 2020. Findings & Value added: The study results indicate an increase in the unemployment rate in Slovakia during 2020 by 2?3% compared to the trend of its development, which would have occurred without a pandemic. Given the counterfactual method used, this difference can be described as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study can be used in practice in the design and implementation of measures introduced to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on unemployment and, in the long-term perspective, also to eliminate these effects as much as possible. It can also be used as a theoretical tool in conducting impact assessments, which have so far been carried out very rarely in Slovakia.","Svabova, Lucia Eva Nahalkova Tesarova Durica Marek Strakova Lenka",Equilibrium,256,11

In this instance, the use of computers for communication (i.e. computer-mediated communication, CMC) may help to enhance older people’s social interactions and relationships. In the present study, 113 community-dwelling users of CMC, aged 65 years and over, were surveyed in order to better understand the effects of CMC in addition to the individual characteristics contributing to patterns of online communication. An opportunity to examine the impact of the pandemic on CMC behaviours presented approximately 12 months after the initial study with 70 participants resurveyed. High levels of social functioning, in addition to good physical and psychological health, were reported by this group of digitally active users. A positive association between high CMC use and social functioning was noted, even after controlling for differences in personality, frequency of face-to-face communication, health, gender, and relationship status. Interestingly, the pandemic saw a reduction in weekly CMC use, although CMC-based behaviours remained unchanged. The present findings highlight the important role that technology has in facilitating and maintaining supports and, potentially, reducing social isolation by helping older adults stay in touch with family and friends.

As with prior emerging infectious diseases (such as HIV, SARS, and Ebola), US public health experts and governmental agencies positioned themselves as authoritative producers of emerging scientific knowledge, including best practices for public masking. US epidemiological outcomes, however, have sorely lagged behind many other countries. The US leads the world in confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19, undermining presumed hierarchies in global health authority today. In this essay, I compare US and Taiwanese masking policies, delineating how social relations of care in the US become sites of political conflict within a hierarchical global ecology of scientific knowledge and medical supplies. Drawing upon my experience as a MD/PhD in anthropology trainee studying emerging infectious diseases and as a Taiwanese American immigrant, I explore conflicts over mask acquisition and usage across borders and time, illuminating global inequities of scientific knowledge production and pandemic containment and underscoring racialised disavowals that persist in US public health.

Measures of lowering social interaction were taken throughout 2020 and intensified during the first and second wave when needed. This pandemic could have influenced the access to care and advanced therapies for patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). In the electronic platform “Tool for Administrative Reimbursement Drug Information Sharing” (TARDIS), data from all Belgian RA patients on biologic and targeted therapy are collected during the submission of a request for initiation and prolongation of reimbursement for these drugs. Objectives: to investigate the effect of the COVID19 pandemic on the monthly prescription behaviour of a new advanced therapy in 2020 by comparing it to 2019. Methods: Patients were selected for this analysis if they started a new TNFi, B/T cell therapy, IL6 inhibitors or tsDMARD therapy in the TARDIS registry in 2019 or in 2020. Rheumatologists request reimbursement via the online TARDIS tool, which is considered here as a new drug prescription. Prescription behaviour was compared between 2019 and 2020, between bionaive and bioexperienced patients, and between the different drug classes Results: In 2019, 2949 patients were prescribed any new advanced therapy, including 1153 TNFi, 469 B/T cell therapy, 436 IL6 inhibitors and 891 tsDMARDs. In 2020, 2998 patients were prescribed any new advanced therapy including 1233 TNFi, 382 B/T cell therapy, 496 IL6 inhibitors and 887 tsDMARDs. On a monthly basis, on average 246 and 250 new advanced therapies were prescribed in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Monthly deviations from this average in 2019 ranged from -19% to +16%. Monthly deviations from this average in 2020 ranged from -50% to +30%. Figure 1A shows the monthly prescription of new advanced therapies in 2019 and 2020.

Monthly deviations in bioexperienced patients ranged from -40% to +25%, compared to -19% to +17% in 2019. Comparison per drug class in 2020 show similar trends. IL6 inhibitors show a slightly different timeline than other drugs classes with other periods of less or more prescriptions changes compared to the other drugs classes. See Figure 1B. Conclusion: The COVID19 pandemic did affect reimbursement requests for patients starting new advanced therapies in March and April 2020, especially for bionaive patients. The latter half of 2020 was apparently used to catch up with reimbursement requests for patients in need for advanced therapies resulting in similar total numbers of patients treated with advanced therapy in 2019 and 2020. The choice for a particular drug type was not clearly influenced by the pandemic. IL6 inhibitor use did seem to be affected differently by the pandemic, yet caution is warranted as these relatively large differences in proportional changes parallel small differences in actual drug numbers. In sum, the observed effect of the pandemic on initiating advanced therapy during the first wave corresponds with Belgian governmental measures that restricted non-essential care which was less observed in the latter half of 2020.","De Cock, D.; Durez, P.; Badot, V.; Westhovens, R.; Verschueren, P.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,256,28

This task is categorized into two sub-tasks: detection, and re-identification task. Previous methods independently treat two sub-tasks, only focusing on the re-identification task without employing re-detection. Since the performance of pedestrian detection directly affects the results of tracking, leveraging the detection task is crucial for improving the re-identification task. The total inference time is computed in both the detection and re-identification process, quite far from real-time speed. This paper joins both sub-tasks in a single end-to-end network based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, the detection includes the classification and regression task. As both tasks have a positive correlation, separately learning classification and regression hurts the overall performance. Hence, this work introduces the Regression-Aware Classification Feature (RACF) module to improve feature representation. The convolutional layer is the core component of CNNs, which extracts local features without modeling global features. Therefore, the Cross-Global Context (CGC) is proposed to form long-range dependencies for learning appearance embedding of re-identification features.

In this work, we propose an approach for detecting facial masks in videos using deep learning. The proposed framework capitalizes on the MTCNN face detection model to identify the faces and their corresponding facial landmarks present in the video frame. These facial images and cues are then processed by a neoteric classifier that utilises the MobileNetV2 architecture as an object detector for identifying masked regions.

In this study, we developed a model for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by solving the classification problem using a self-supervised learning technique with a convolution attention module. Self-supervised learning using a U-shaped convolutional neural network model combined with a convolution block attention module (CBAM) using over 100,000 chest X-Ray images with structure similarity (SSIM) index captures image representations extremely well. The system we proposed consists of fine-tuning the weights of the encoder after a self-supervised learning pretext task, interpreting the chest X-ray representation in the encoder using convolutional layers, and diagnosing the chest X-ray image as the classification model. Additionally, considering the CBAM further improves the averaged accuracy of 98.6%, thereby outperforming the baseline model (97.8%) by 0.8%.

The accessory proteins have been less well characterized and are difficult to predict by classical bioinformatics methods. We propose a computational tool GOFIX to characterize potential ORFs in virus genomes. In particular, ORF coding potential is estimated by searching for enrichment in motifs of the X circular code, that is known to be over-represented in the reading frames of viral genes. We applied GOFIX to study the SARS-CoV-2 and related genomes including SARS-CoV and SARS-like viruses from bat, civet and pangolin hosts, focusing on the accessory proteins.

Sixty-six staff members (20 percent) felt stigmatized and rejected in their neighborhood because of their hospital work, and 20 of 218 health care workers (9 percent) reported reluctance to work or had considered resignation.","Bai, YaMei; Lin, Chao-Cheng; Lin, Chih-Yuan; Chen, Jen-Yeu; Chue, Ching-Mo; Chou, Pesus",Psychiatric services,256,1

METHODS The peripheral blood picture and liver function of 169 cases with SARS were analyzed. These patients were admitted to five hospitals in Taiyuan from March to May, 2003. RESULTS Above 90.00% patients had normal or low white blood cell (WBC) count on the first day. From then on, during the second to third week, about 40.00% of the patients showed high WBC count average: (13.42+/-2.87)x10(9)/L at 15 th day and (13.68+/-3.26)x10(9)/L at 21 st day) and neutrophil (0.809+/-0.063 at 15 th day and 0.805+/-0.061 at 21 st day), and 21.97%-52.15% cases with low lymphocyte count (0.111+/-0.044-0.134+/-0.040). About 4.44%-12.76% of patients developed low platelet and 4.20%-33.33% of cases with low hemoglobin level. And 32.76%-62.50% of cases were found to have high alanine aminotransferase (above 40 U/L), 13.04%-40.00% cases with high aspartate aminotransferase (above 40 U/L) and 40.35%-72.00% cases with low albumin content. But serum total protein remained normal during the whole clinical course. CONCLUSION SARS cases may develop leucocytosis, low lymphocyte count, low platelet count, low hemoglobin level and abnormal liver function.","Zhao, Long-feng; Xing, Hui-chun; Xu, Li-ping",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,256,1

METHODS From August 2014 to May 2015, 20 consecutive patients with esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma underwent surgery. EJA was performed using a new technique; the free margins of the esophageal stump were suspended and the anvil of a circular stapler on a new dedicated and registered support bar (characterized by a push-rod making possible to hook-unhook the anvil of the circular stapler) was inserted into the lumen. Subsequently, the linear suturing stapler was closed over the bar and fired to suture the distal stump of the esophagus; the bar was retracted and the push-rod of the anvil was pulled out through the linear suture. Finally, the anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications, and R0 resection was achieved in all cases. Postoperative course has been uneventful for 18 patients (90%). Only 1 patient (5%) developed fistula, conservatively treated.

Clinical manifestations occur shortly after exposure, or a few days later. There is controversy regarding the transmission of the virus through the tear and conjunctiva; however, there are reports that the ocular surface might be a potential target for COVID-19. The ease of transmission of this virus at close proximity presents a risk to eyecare workers. Several recommendations have been issued by local and national organizations to address the issue of safe ophthalmic practice during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines have numerous similarities; however, subtle differences exist. The purpose of this paper was to discuss measures, with a specific focus on standard precautions, to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 at Eye Clinics.

The ability to bind to a predetermined chemical structure stimulated the imagination of drug discoverers and developers. Nevertheless it took many years before a drug was registered which started to make good on the promise. The complexity of the molecule, made up of four polypeptide chains, its large molecular weight, its multiple and versatile functional domains and its mouse origin initially were obstacles for the production and the utilisation. Also the selection of appropriate target structures on the surface of cells turned out be difficult. Many of these difficulties have been overcome. The replacement of most of the murine sequences with equivalent human sequences and the concomittant decrease in immunogenicity, and the identification of cell surface components which are causative and limiting in cellular transformation have made monoclonal antibodies valuable weapons in the fight against cancer. Multiple mechanisms of monoclonal antibody action are being exploited for this purpose. Antibodies can sequester growth factors and prevent the activation of crucial growth factor receptors. A monoclonal antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be a potent neo-vascularisation inhibitor (bevacizumab). An antibody against the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor prevents the binding of the ligand to the receptor and thereby its activation (cetuximab). EGFR activity, however, is absolutely required for the survival and proliferation of certain human tumour cells. An antibody which interferes with the dimerisation of the ErbB2 and the ErbB3 members of the EGF receptor family prevents the association of a most potent signaling module (pertuxumab). The signals emenating from this dimer determine many phenotypic properties of e.g. human breast cancer cells. A monoclonal antibody also directed against ErbB2 has been most successful, clinically and commercially (trastuzumab). This antibody interferes with signals generated by the receptor and causes the arrest of the cell cycle in tumour cells. In addition, it recruits immune effector cells as cytotoxic agents. Finally, monoclonal antibody derivatives, single chain Fv fragments, have been used as a basis for the construction of recombinant tumour toxins. These molecules harness the exquisite binding specificity of the antibodies and combine them with the toxic principles of bacteria.","Groner, Bernd; Hartmann, Cord; Wels, Winfried",Current molecular medicine,256,1

However, degree of this association is often debated, especially in homebound elders with disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of frailty on cognitive function in older adults receiving homecare. A screening for frailty and cognitive function was conducted at 12 primary healthcare settings of the nationally funded program ""Help at Home"" in Heraklion Crete, Greece. Cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire and the SHARE-f index, respectively. Barthel-Activities of Daily Living and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were also used for the identification of disability and comorbidity, respectively. The mean age of the 192 participants (66% female) was 78.04 ± 8.01 years old. In depth-analysis using multiple linear regression, revealed that frailty was not significantly associated with cognitive decline (frail vs. non-frail (B'=-2.39, p=0.246) even after adjusting for depression and multi-comorbidity. Importantly, as protective factors for cognitive decline progression and thus dementia development, was scientifically correlated with annual individual income >4500 (B'=2.31, p=0.005) -poverty threshold-compared to those with <4500 and, higher education level as compared to Uneducated (B'=2.94, p=0.019). However, depression was associated with cognitive decline regardless of socioeconomic variables. In conclusion, our results suggest that health professionals caring for frail people with cognitive impairment, must focus on early recognition and management of depression.","Kleisiaris, C; Kaffatou, E M; Papathanasiou, I; Androulakis, E; Panagiotakis, S; Alvino, S; Tziraki, C",Translational medicine @ UniSa,256,11

Here we demonstrate that, independently of HIV replication, transfected or HIV-infected cells that express Env induced autophagy and accumulation of Beclin 1 in uninfected CD4+ T lymphocytes via CXCR4. The same phenomena occurred in a T cell line and in transfected HEK.293 cells that expressed both wild-type CXCR4 and a truncated form of CD4 that is unable to bind the lymphocyte-specific protein kinase Lck. Env-mediated autophagy is required to trigger CD4+ T cell apoptosis since blockade of autophagy at different steps, by either drugs (3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1) or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1/Atg6 and Atg7 genes, totally inhibited the apoptotic process. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells still underwent Env-mediated cell death with autophagic features when apoptosis was inhibited. These results suggest that HIV-infected cells can induce autophagy in bystander CD4+ T lymphocytes through contact of Env with CXCR4, leading to apoptotic cell death, a mechanism most likely contributing to immunodeficiency.","Espert, Lucile; Denizot, Mélanie; Grimaldi, Marina; Robert-Hebmann, Véronique; Gay, Bernard; Varbanov, Mihayl; Codogno, Patrice; Biard-Piechaczyk, Martine",The Journal of clinical investigation,256,1

NSTI involves necrosis of the afflicted tissue and is potentially life threatening due to major and rapid destruction of tissue, which often leads to septic shock and organ failure. The gold standard for identification of pathogens is culture; however molecular methods for identification of microorganisms may provide a more rapid result and may be able to identify additional microorganisms that are not detected by culture. METHODS In this study, tissue samples (n = 20) obtained after debridement of 10 patients with NSTI were analyzed by standard culture, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiple molecular methods. The molecular methods included analysis of microbial diversity by 1) direct 16S and D2LSU rRNA gene Microseq 2) construction of near full-length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries with subsequent Sanger sequencing for most samples, 3) the Ibis T5000 biosensor and 4) 454-based pyrosequencing. Furthermore, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to verify and determine the relative abundance of Streptococcus pyogenes in samples. RESULTS For 70 % of the surgical samples it was possible to identify microorganisms by culture. Some samples did not result in growth (presumably due to administration of antimicrobial therapy prior to sampling). The molecular methods identified microorganisms in 90 % of the samples, and frequently detected additional microorganisms when compared to culture. Although the molecular methods generally gave concordant results, our results indicate that Microseq may misidentify or overlook microorganisms that can be detected by other molecular methods. Half of the patients were found to be infected with S. pyogenes, but several atypical findings were also made including infection by a) Acinetobacter baumannii, b) Streptococcus pneumoniae, and c) fungi, mycoplasma and Fusobacterium necrophorum. CONCLUSION The study emphasizes that many pathogens can be involved in NSTIs, and that no specific ""NSTI causing"" combination of species exists. This means that clinicians should be prepared to diagnose and treat any combination of microbial pathogens. Some of the tested molecular methods offer a faster turnaround time combined with a high specificity, which makes supplemental use of such methods attractive for identification of microorganisms, especially for fulminant life-threatening infections such as NSTI.","Rudkjøbing, Vibeke Børsholt; Thomsen, Trine Rolighed; Xu, Yijuan; Melton-Kreft, Rachael; Ahmed, Azad; Eickhardt, Steffen; Bjarnsholt, Thomas; Poulsen, Steen Seier; Nielsen, Per Halkjær; Earl, Joshua P; Ehrlich, Garth D; Moser, Claus",BMC infectious diseases,256,1

However, it has recently been reported in the United Kingdom that the group 2 coronavirus gene, which is more closely related to the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and human coronavirus strain OC43, has been detected in respiratory tract tissue samples from dogs with respiratory disease. In this study, we examined the prevalence of antibodies to group 2 coronaviruses in domestic dogs and cats in Japan by a neutralization test using BCoV. All 104 feline serum samples were negative (<1:5) for anti-BCoV antibodies. In contrast, of the 898 canine serum samples, 160 (17.8%) were positive for anti-BCoV antibodies, and the antibody titers ranged from 1:5 to more than 1:640, with 1:160 being the most frequent. No correlation was found between the titers of the anti-BCoV and anti-CCoV antibodies in the 198 serum samples of dogs with a known history of CCoV vaccination. We amplified, by RT-PCR, group 2 coronavirus-specific hemagglutination/esterase genes in the oral swabs of a total of 10 young pups presenting with or having recovered from respiratory signs, or having anti-BCoV antibodies, with the result that 2 pups were positive for the hemagglutination/esterase genes.

Cloning and sequencing of the nPCR assay product enabled investigation of the evolutionary relationships between strains within the S gene. The simple and rapid procedure described here makes this assay an ideal alternative technique to electron microscopy and viral isolation in cell culture for detection of CCV shedding in feces.

Infectious TAstV-2 can be recovered from multiple tissues, including the blood, suggesting that there is a viremic stage during infection. In spite of the severe diarrhea, histopathologic changes in the intestine were mild and there was a surprising lack of inflammation. This may be due to the increased activation of the potent immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor beta during astrovirus infection.

In this study, we investigated the determinants of the equilibrium frequency of potential colonists in the RNA bacteriophage 6. We isolated 40 spontaneous mutants capable of infecting a novel Pseudomonas syringae host and sequenced their host attachment genes to identify the responsible mutations. We observed 16 different mutations in the host attachment gene and used a new statistical approach to estimate that 39 additional mutations were missed by our screen. Phenotypic and fitness assays confirmed that the proximate mechanism underlying host range expansion was an increase in the ability to attach to the novel host and that acquisition of this ability most often imposed a cost for growth rate on two standard hosts. Considered in a population genetic framework, our data suggest that host range mutations should exist in phage populations at an equilibrium frequency (3 x 10(-4)) that exceeds the phage mutation rate by more than two orders of magnitude. Thus, colonization of novel hosts is unlikely to be limited by an inability to produce appropriate mutations.","Ferris, Martin T; Joyce, Paul; Burch, Christina L",Genetics,256,1

Background Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran. Methods We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation. Results We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction. Conclusion Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0<1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases. We additionally recommend that traffic restriction be combined with other controlling measures.","Olfatifar, Meysam; Alali, Walid Q; Houri, Hamidreza; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Babaee, Ebrahim; Seifollahi, Romian; Sharifian, Afsaneh; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,256,24

METHODS Sixty-one cases of SARS with positive antibodies to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were classified into the following categories: initial stage (3 - 7 days), peak stage (8 - 14 days), and remission and recovery stage (15 - 27 days). Forty-four healthy individuals were used as controls. Serum levels of ILs, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 were measured in all subjects. Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected only in SARS cases. RESULTS The mean concentration of serum IL-6 in SARS patients did not differ from that in the control group in initial and peak stages, but became significantly higher in remission and recovery stage compared with the control group, initial and peak stages (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of serum IL-8 in SARS patients did not differ from that of the control group in initial stage, but was significantly higher than control group in peak stage and remission and recovery stage (P < 0.05). And it was more significantly higher in remission and recovery stage than in peak stage (P < 0.01). The mean concentrations of IL-16 and TNF-alpha in SARS patients were higher than those of the control group for every length of the clinical courses investigated, and were especially high in remission and recovery stage (P < 0.01). SARS patients experienced higher concentration of serum IL-13 compared with the controls in initial stage (P < 0.01), but returned to normal levels in peak stage and in remission and recovery stage. The mean concentration of serum IL-18 in SARS patients was significantly lower than that of the control group during all clinical courses (P < 0.05). The mean concentration of serum TGF-beta1 in SARS patients was higher than that of the control group during all clinical courses. Although TGF-beta1 in serum decreased in remission and recovery stage in SARS patients, the average was still higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Most proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta 1 were elevated during the early phase of SARS, which may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation. Concurrently, the mean concentration of serum IL-13 decreased gradually, and the mean concentration of serum IL-18 level in SARS patients was lower than that of the control group during all the courses of SARS, suggesting that the immune state of the patients with SARS was obviously abnormal. Observing the dynamic changes in blood cytokine levels can provide a scientific basis to assess pathogenesis and efficacy of clinical treatment of SARS.",,Chinese medical journal,256,1

A total of 739 (HEV strain 67N) and 751 (strains NT9 and VW572) nucleotides were sequenced. Two ORFs, potentially encoding proteins of 12.8 and 9.6 kDa, were identified. Pairwise comparisons with the corresponding ORFs in bovine coronavirus (BCV) and human coronavirus (HCV) OC43 revealed sequence similarities of greater than 88.5 percent at the nucleotide and 85.3 percent at the amino acid level for the 12.8 kDa ORF product. For the 9.6 kDa ORF product similarities were greater than 96.9 percent and 95.2 percent, respectively. An additional 12 nucleotide deletion upstream of the 12.8 kDa ORF start codon was found in HEV 67N compared to NT9 and VW572.

The virus is emergent from South East (SE) Asian mammals: either the civet cat, a related species or a rat species. The virus has a long incubation period and low reproduction number (R0 value) and hence the first outbreak in 2004 was controlled by hygiene and quarantine. However, the healthcare system was compromised and the economic cost was extremely high. Fortunately, the virus is easily cultivated in Vero E6 cells and therefore the search for new antivirals and vaccines was initiated within weeks of the discovery of the virus using classic techniques of cell culture and electron microscopy. Molecular diagnostics facilitated rapid and accurate diagnosis, a key factor in containing the outbreak. The broad-spectrum molecule ribavirin was used in SE Asia in infected patients alongside corticosteroids. In retrospect, many patients survived due to careful nursing. The only currently accepted intervention is interferon. Coronavirus replicon systems should facilitate rapid screening of new inhibitors and the complex mechanism of viral replication will ensure that drugs are developed against at least five molecular targets, in particular the viral protease.","Oxford, John S; Balasingam, Shobana; Chan, Charlotte; Catchpole, Andrew; Lambkin, Robert",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,256,15

The present article presents the positions of a broad spectrum of Orthodox rabbinical rulings ranging from Haredi to National Religious to Modern Orthodox on this issue. The overwhelming majority of the halakhic authorities cited are in favor of the vaccination of both adults and children. It is noteworthy that in their decisions the rabbis rely on mainstream medical expertise in relation to the threat to both individual and public health as a result of non-vaccination. They also demonstrate awareness of the arguments of those opposed to vaccination and find ways to refute them. Nevertheless, there are vaccinations such as the one against human papillomavirus infection that are not approved by many rabbis. In order to ensure adequate vaccination-induced immunity to highly infectious diseases in Israel it is vital that the medical community is aware of the normative halakhic position, and is able, if necessary, to explain it to the religious population. This need is even more pressing in the midst of the present COVID-19 pandemic, since the success of the vaccination program depends upon the voluntary cooperation of all sectors of the population, and statistically, the religious community would appear to have a comparatively higher infection rate than other groups.","Lerman, Yehuda; Sinclair, Daniel",Harefuah,256,25

Development of consensus guidelines to standardize these wide variations in care has become a prime objective. The Lebanese Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (LSIDCM) convened to set Lebanese national guidelines for the management of CAP since it is a major and a prevalent disease affecting the Lebanese population. These guidelines, besides being helpful in direct clinical practice, play a major role in establishing stewardship programs in hospitals in an effort to contain antimicrobial resistance on the national level. These guidelines are intended for primary care practitioners and emergency medicine physicians.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis…1.

Some research suggests that trainees may benefit from being allowed to actively shape their learning environments, which could alleviate some of the time and resource pressures in surgical training. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of self-directed or prescribed practice schedules (random or blocked) on learning suturing skills. METHODS Participants watched an instructional video for simple interrupted, vertical mattress and horizontal mattress suturing then completed a pretest to assess baseline skills. Participants were assigned to 1 of 4 practice groups: self-directed practice schedule, prescribed blocked practice schedule, prescribed random practice schedule or matched to the self-directed group (control). Practice of the skill was followed by a delayed (1 h) posttest. Improvement from pretest to posttest was determined based on differences in performance time and expert-based assessments. RESULTS Analyses revealed a significant effect of group for difference in performance time of the simple interrupted suture. Random practice did not show the expected advantage for skill learning, but there was an advantage of self-directed practice. CONCLUSION Self-directed practice schedules may be desirable for optimal learning of simple technical skills, even when expert instruction is available. Instructors must also take into account the interaction between task difficulty and conditions of practice to develop ideal training environments.","Safir, Oleg; Williams, Camille K; Dubrowski, Adam; Backstein, David; Carnahan, Heather",Canadian journal of surgery.

Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R(0)). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.","Fraser, Christophe; Riley, Steven; Anderson, Roy M; Ferguson, Neil M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,256,28

The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D",Prehosp Disaster Med,256,16

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was &#8805;96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","van Kasteren, Puck B; van der Veer, Bas; van den Brink, Sharon; Wijsman, Lisa; de Jonge, Jørgen; van den Brandt, Annemarie; Molenkamp, Richard; Reusken, Chantal B E M; Meijer, Adam",J Clin Virol,256,21

Time variation in model parameters is captured using the generalized autoregressive score modelling structure designed for the typically daily count data related to pandemic. The resulting specification permits a flexible yet parsimonious model structure with a very low computational cost. This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce and the uncertainty is abundant. Full sample results show that countries including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling window. This, in turn, transforms into accurate short-term predictions of the active cases. We further modify the model to allow for unreported cases. Results suggest that the effects of the presence of these cases on the estimation results diminish towards the end of sample with the increasing number of testing.","Cakmakli, Cem; Simsek, Yasin",,256,21

In this review, we aim to highlight the known mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of high-dose IVIg therapy, the immunopathological hypothesis of viral pneumonia, and the clinical evidence of IVIg therapy in viral pneumonia. We then make cautious therapeutic inferences about high-dose IVIg therapy in treating severe COVID-19. These inferences may provide relevant and useful insights in order to aid treatment for COVID-19.","Liu, Xiaosheng; Cao, Wei; Li, Taisheng",Front Immunol,256,21

Objective: Here we describe the differences between rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal and diluted samples, simulating the need for dilution due to the presence of amplification inhibitors. Material and method: Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) from samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients previously detected as ""Negative"" and 21 patients detected as ""Positive"" for SARS-CoV-2 was performed with the EasyExtract DNA-RNA kit (Interprise®). The rRT-PCR was performed with the OneStep/COVID-19 kit (IBMP), with normal and diluted (80 µl of H2O RNAse free) samples, totaling 82 tests. Results: The results indicate that there is an average variation (a &lt; 0.05) delaying the Cq between the results of amplification of the internal control (IC), N gene (NG), and ORF1ab (OF), 1.811 Cq, 3.840 Cq, and 3.842 Cq, respectively. Discussion: The extraction kit does not completely purify the inhibitor compounds; therefore, no amplified product result may occur. In this study, we obtained a 19.04% false-negative diagnosis after sample dilution; this process reduces the efficiency of rRT-PCR to 29.8% in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Knowing the rRT-PCR standards of diluted samples can assist in the identification of false-negative cases and, consequently, avoid incorrect diagnosis.","Fruehwirth, Marcelo; Rivas, Açucena V.; Fitz, Andressa F.

Due to the lack of sanitary protection equipment, hundreds of volunteers, the so-called “Coronavirus Makers” community, used their home 3D printers to produce sanitary components, such as face covers and masks, which protect doctors, nurses, patients, and other civil servants from the virus. However, an important challenge arose: how to organize the daily collection of these items from individual homes, so they could be transported to the assembling centers and, later, distributed to the different hospitals in the area. For over one month, we have designed daily routing plans to pick up the maximum number of items in a limited time—thus reducing the drivers’ exposure to the virus. Since the problem characteristics were different each day, a series of computational intelligence algorithms was employed. Most of them included flexible heuristic-based approaches and biased-randomized algorithms, which were capable of generating, in a few minutes, feasible and high-quality solutions to quite complex and realistic optimization problems. This chapter describes the process of adapting several of our ‘heavy’ route-optimization algorithms from the scientific literature into ‘agile’ ones, which were able to cope with the dynamic daily conditions of real-life routing problems. Moreover, it also discusses some of the computational aspects of the employed algorithms along with several computational experiments and presents a series of best practices that we were able to learn during this intensive experience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Tordecilla, R.

Here we aim to develop a theoretical model to study the detection process of SARS-COV-2 in lateral flow device (LFD), which can achieve rapid antigen diagnostic tests. The LFD is modeled as the adhesion of a spherical nanoparticle (NP) coated with ligands on the surface, mimicking the SARS-COV-2, on an infinite substrate distributed with receptors under a simple shear flow. The adhesive behaviors of NPs in the LFD are governed by the ligand receptor binding (LRB) and local hydrodynamics. Through energy balance analysis, three types of motion are predicted: (i) firm-adhesion (FA); (ii) adhesive-rolling (AR); and (iii) free-rolling (FR), which correspond to LRB-dominated, LRB-hydrodynamics-competed, and hydrodynamics-dominated regimes, respectively. The transitions of FA-to-AR and AR-to-FR are found to be triggered by overcoming LRB barrier and saturation of LRB torque, respectively. Most importantly, in the AR regime, the smaller NPs can move faster than their larger counterparts, induced by the LRB effect that depends on the radius R of NPs. In addition, a scaling law is found in the AR regime that v â Î³ Ë R &#945; (rolling velocity v and shear rate Î³ Ë ), with an approximate scaling factor &#945; â¼ - 0 . 2 ± 0 . 05 identified through fitting both theoretical and numerical results. The scaling factor emerges from the energy-based stochastic LRB model, and is confirmed to be universal by examining selections of different LRB model parameters. This size-dependent rolling behavior under the control of flow strength may provide the theoretical guidance for designing efficient LFD in detecting infectious disease.","Ye, Huilin; Shen, Zhiqiang; Li, Ying",Extreme Mech Lett,256,19

In the Netherlands, hospitals scaled up their ICU and clinical admission capacity at an early stage of the pandemic. The importance of coordinating resources during a pandemic has already been emphasized in the literature. Therefore, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 admissions, national and regional task forces were established for the purpose of coordinating patient transfers. This review describes the experience of ROAZ region Noord-Holland Flevoland, in coordinating patient transfers in the Amsterdam region. In total, 130 patient transfers were coordinated by our region, of which 73% patients were transferred to a hospital within the region. Over a two-month period, similarities regarding days with increased patient transfers were seen between our region and the national task force. In parallel, an increased incidence in hospital admissions in the Netherlands was observed. During a pandemic, an early upscale (an increase in surge spaces) of hospital admission capacity is imperative. Furthermore, it is preferred to establish national and regional task forces, coordinated by physicians experienced and trained in handling crisis situations, adhering full transparency regarding hospital admission capacity.","Berkeveld, E; Mikdad, S; Zandbergen, H R; Kraal, A; Terra, M; Kramer, M H H; Bloemers, F W",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,256,21

This meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for observational and case-controlled studies. We sorted medications into glucocorticoids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs), which was also divided into monotherapy and b/tsDMARDs-csDMARDs combination therapy. RESULTS: We analysed 62 observational studies with a total of 319 025 patients with autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.011 (95% CI: 0.005 to 0.025). Meta-analysis of seven case-controlled studies demonstrated that the risk of COVID-19 in autoimmune diseases was significantly higher than in control patients (OR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.58, p=0.038). Meta-regression analysis showed glucocorticoids were significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19. For clinical outcomes, we assessed 65 studies with 2766 patients with autoimmune diseases diagnosed with COVID-19. The rates of hospitalisation and mortality were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.23 to 0.50) and 0.066 (95% CI: 0.036 to 0.12), respectively. Glucocorticoids, csDMARDs and b/tsDMARDs-csDMARDs combination therapy increased the risk of these outcomes, whereas b/tsDMARDs monotherapy, particularly antitumour necrosis factor agents, were associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation and death. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with autoimmune diseases had an increased risk of COVID-19, primarily attributed to glucocorticoid use. b/tsDMARDs monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 suggesting its safety in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akiyama, Shintaro; Hamdeh, Shadi; Micic, Dejan; Sakuraba, Atsushi",Ann. rheum. dis,256,29

(Special Issue: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),15.128541,6.9261065,2020,AIMS: We performed an audit to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related delay in the diagnosis of major cancers at a Pathology Unit of a Secondary Care Hospital Network in Italy. METHODS: A comparison was made among the number of first cellular pathological diagnoses of malignancy made from the 11th to the 20th week of the years 2018-2020. RESULTS: Cancer diagnoses fell in 2020 by 39% compared with the average number recorded in 2018 and 2019. Prostate cancer (75%) bladder cancer (66%) and colorectal cancer (CRC; 62%) had the greatest decrease. CRC was identified as carrying a potentially important diagnostic delay. CONCLUSIONS: For CRC corrective procedures (continuing mass screening tests; patient triage by family physicians; diagnostic procedures alternative to colonoscopy; predictive evaluation on biopsy samples) were advised. Our simple audit model is widely applicable to avoid pandemic-related delay in clinical diagnosis of cancer.,"De Vincentiis, Ludovica; Carr, Richard A; Mariani, Maria Paola; Ferrara, Gerardo",J. clin. pathol,256,24

The effects of SAH orders on the trauma population remain unknown. We hypothesized an increase in rates of penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds, suicide attempts, and domestic violence in the Southern California trauma population after the SAH order. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of all trauma patients presenting to 11 American College of Surgeons levels I and II trauma centers spanning seven counties in California was performed. Demographic data, injury characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into three groups based on injury date: before SAH from January 1, 2020, to March 18, 2020 (PRE), after SAH from March 19, 2020, to June 30, 2020 (POST), and a historical control from March 19, 2019, to June 30, 2019 (CONTROL).

METHODS: In this study, cell models of overexpressed or silenced RNF6 were established by liposome transfection, and IM-12 was used as the inhibitor of GSK3ß. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blots were used to detect the expression of RNF6, p-GSK3ß, GSK3ß, and ß-catenin, and MTT assays were used to quantify cell proliferation. The tumorigenicity of cells was observed by plate clonal formation assay; the invasiveness of cells was examined in Transwell Boyden chambers, and the migratory capacity of cells was tested by scratch wound assays. The rat CRC model was induced by AOM/DSS, in which we verified activity in the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway by examining GSK3ß phosphorylation. RESULTS: RNF6 was upregulated in CRC samples and cell lines. Silencing or overexpressing RNF6 in colorectal cancer cells inhibited or promoted, respectively, the proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration of CRC cells, as well as expression of p-GSK3ß, GSK3ß and ß-catenin. IM-12 reversed the Wnt/ß-catenin-activated state change induced by RNF6 silencing and the inhibition of cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration. The same results were observed in vivo in the rat CRC model. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of RNF6 in CRC increased the GSK3ß phosphorylation level, which led to activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and promoted the invasion and migration of CRC cells, suggesting that RNF6 may be a novel target for the treatment of CRC.","Li, Qiken; Wang, Gang; Tao, Jinhua; Chen, Weiping",Pathol Res Pract,256,16

Recent clinical successes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in therapy for viral infections demonstrate that mAbs offer a solution for these emerging biothreats. We have explored this with respect to Junin virus (JUNV), an arenavirus classified as a category A high-priority agent and the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs available for preventing or treating AHF, although immune plasma from convalescent patients is used routinely to treat active infections. However, immune plasma is severely limited in quantity, highly variable in quality, and poses significant safety risks including the transmission of transfusion-borne diseases. mAbs offer a highly specific and consistently potent alternative to immune plasma that can be manufactured at large scale. We previously described a chimeric mAb, cJ199, that provided protection in a guinea pig model of AHF. To adapt this mAb to a format more suitable for clinical use, we humanized the mAb (hu199) and evaluated it in a cynomolgus monkey model of AHF with two JUNV isolates, Romero and Espindola. While untreated control animals experienced 100% lethality, all animals treated with hu199 at 6 d postinoculation (dpi) survived, and 50% of animals treated at 8 dpi survived. mAbs like hu199 may offer a safer, scalable, and more reproducible alternative to immune plasma for rare viral diseases that have epidemic potential.","Zeitlin, Larry; Cross, Robert W; Geisbert, Joan B; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Agans, Krystle N; Prasad, Abhishek N; Enterlein, Sven; Aman, M Javad; Bornholdt, Zachary A; Brennan, Miles B; Campbell, Lioudmila; Kim, Do; Mlakar, Neil; Moyer, Crystal L; Pauly, Michael H; Shestowsky, William; Whaley, Kevin J; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Proc.

Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS- and MERS-related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively. No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in this study. Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species. Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses and had a wider distribution in Korea. Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species. Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.","Lo, Van Thi; Yoon, Sun-Woo; Noh, Ji Yeong; Kim, Youngji; Choi, Yong Gun; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Kim, Hye Kwon",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The United States began a vaccination campaign at the end of 2020 targeting primarily elderly residents before extending access to younger individuals. With both COVID-19 infection fatality ratios and vaccine uptake being heterogeneous across ages, an important consideration is whether the age contribution to deaths shifted over time towards younger age groups. In this study, we use a Bayesian non-parametric spatial approach to estimate the age-specific contribution to COVID-19 attributable deaths over time. The proposed spatial approach is a low-rank Gaussian Process projected by regularised B-splines. Simulation analyses and benchmark results show that the spatial approach performs better than a standard B-splines approach and equivalently well as a standard Gaussian Process, for considerably lower runtimes. We find that COVID-19 has been especially deadly in the United States. The mortality rates among individuals aged 85+ ranged from 1\% to 5\% across the US states. Since the beginning of the vaccination campaign, the number of weekly deaths reduced in every US state with a faster decrease among individuals aged 75+ than individuals aged 0-74. Simultaneously to this reduction, the contribution of individuals age 75+ to deaths decreased, with important disparities in the timing and rapidity of this decrease across the country.","Monod, M'elodie; Blenkinsop, Alexandra; Brizzi, Andrea; Chen, Yu; Jogarah, Vidoushee; Wang, Yuanrong; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir; Ratmann, Oliver",,256,1

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine Chinese netizens' concerns related to COVID-19 and the relationship between their concerns and Internet information; and to elucidate the association between individuals' concerns, knowledge, and behavior related to COVID-19. METHODS: The questionnaire, which consisted of 15 closed-ended questions, was designed to investigate Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants through Dingxiangyisheng WeChat accounts. Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: In total, 10,304 respondents were surveyed on the Internet (response rate = 1.75%, 10,304/590,000). Nearly all (95.30%) participants were concerned about ""confirmed cases"" and 87.70% received information about the outbreak through social media websites. There were significant differences in participants' concerns by sex (P = .016), age (P < .001), educational attainment (P = .001), and occupation (P < .001). All knowledge questions and preventive practices were associated with concerns about COVID-19. The results of the multivariate logistic regression indicate that participants' sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and concern were significantly associated with the proper preventive practices. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated the concerns, information sources, and preventive behaviors of Chinese netizens related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and concern were key factors associated with proper preventive behaviors. This provides the theoretical basis for the government to provide targeted prevention and control information to the public.","Zhao, Yusui; Xu, Shuiyang; Wang, Lei; Huang, Yu; Xu, Yue; Xu, Yan; Lv, Qiaohong; Wang, Zhen; Wu, Qingqing",J. med. internet res,256,1

These patients present symptoms that make food intake and nutrient absorption difficult, therefore involving nutritional risk. On the other hand, acute respiratory complications require prolonged ICU stays, and this predisposes to increased malnutrition and loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which can lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidity long after discharge. For this reason, the world's leading nutrition societies and associations believe that nutritional therapy should be considered a part of the basic treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we have reviewed and compared 9 expert recommendations (ER) published by nutrition societies and associations from China, Spain, Brazil, Europe, Colombia, Australia, America, and the United Kingdom, in relation to critical and non-critical hospitalized patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: the 9 ERs reviewed agree on the importance of nutritional management in critical and non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as on the early detection of nutritional risk, the intervention, and subsequent follow-up. Even so, each published document has its own particularities and puts a special stress on some specific aspect.","Martínez Rodríguez, Jéssica; Roca Fontbona, Maria",Nutr Hosp,256,1

Recent rises in these infections are likely due to complex and multifactorial external drivers, including climate change, the increased mobility of people and goods and rapid demographic change to name but a few. In parallel with these external factors, we are gaining a better understanding of the internal factors associated with viral immunity. Increasingly the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome has been shown to be a significant player in the host immune system, acting as a key regulator of immunity and host defense mechanisms. An increasing body of evidence indicates that disruption of the homeostasis between the GI microbiome and the host immune system can adversely impact viral immunity. This review aims to shed light on our understanding of how host-microbiota interactions shape the immune system, including early life factors, antibiotic exposure, immunosenescence, diet and inflammatory diseases. We also discuss the evidence base for how host commensal organisms and microbiome therapeutics can impact the prevention and/or treatment of viral infections, such as viral gastroenteritis, viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), influenza and SARS CoV-2. The interplay between the gastrointestinal microbiome, invasive viruses and host physiology is complex and yet to be fully characterized, but increasingly the evidence shows that the microbiome can have an impact on viral disease outcomes. While the current evidence base is informative, further well designed human clinical trials will be needed to fully understand the array of immunological mechanisms underlying this intricate relationship.","Harper, Ashton; Vijayakumar, Vineetha; Ouwehand, Arthur C; Ter Haar, Jessica; Obis, David; Espadaler, Jordi; Binda, Sylvie; Desiraju, Shrilakshmi; Day, Richard",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,256,21

We consider sensors equipped with single time-scale estimators and local chi-square ($\chi^2$) detectors to simultaneously opserve the states, share information, fuse the noise/attack-corrupted data locally, and detect possible anomalies in their own observations. While this scheme is applicable to a wide variety of systems associated with full-rank (invertible) matrices, we discuss it within the context of distributed inference in social networks. The proposed technique outperforms existing results in the sense that: (i) we consider Gaussian noise with no simplifying upper-bound assumption on the support; (ii) all existing $\chi^2$-based techniques are centralized while our proposed technique is distributed, where the sensors \textit{locally} detect attacks, with no central coordinator, using specific probabilistic thresholds; and (iii) no local-observability assumption at a sensor is made, which makes our method feasible for large-scale social networks. Moreover, we consider a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) approach to design block-diagonal gain (estimator) matrices under appropriate constraints for isolating the attacks.","Doostmohammadian, Mohammadreza; Charalambous, Themistoklis; Shafie-khah, Miadreza; Meskin, Nader; Khan, Usman A.",,256,1

Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms design (1:1 ratio) PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital and Shahid Dr. Labbafinejad hospital in Tehran and Shahid Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd will be included if they meet the inclusion criteria of the study.

Serologic methods can more accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.","de Assis, Rafael R; Jain, Aarti; Nakajima, Rie; Jasinskas, Algis; Felgner, Jiin; Obiero, Joshua M; Norris, Philip J; Stone, Mars; Simmons, Graham; Bagri, Anil; Irsch, Johannes; Schreiber, Martin; Buser, Andreas; Holbro, Andreas; Battegay, Manuel; Hosimer, Philip; Noesen, Charles; Adenaiye, Oluwasanmi; Tai, Sheldon; Hong, Filbert; Milton, Donald K; Davies, D Huw; Contestable, Paul; Corash, Laurence M; Busch, Michael P; Felgner, Philip L; Khan, Saahir",Nat Commun,256,16

In early 2020, the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV) sharing some sequence similarity with SARS-CoV that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002. The new virus, named SARS-CoV-2, is highly contagious and spread rapidly across the globe causing a pandemic of what became known as coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early observations indicated that cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients are at higher risk of progression to severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, further observations demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce de novo cardiac and vascular damage in previously healthy individuals. Here, we offer an overview of the proposed molecular pathways shared by the pathogenesis of CVD and SARS-CoV infections in order to provide a mechanistic framework for the observed interrelation. We examine the crosstalk between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and mitogen activated kinase pathways that potentially links cardiovascular predisposition and/or outcome to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we summarize the possible effect of currently available drugs with known cardiovascular benefit on these pathways and speculate on their potential utility in mitigating cardiovascular risk and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.","Wehbe, Zena; Hammoud, Safaa; Soudani, Nadia; Zaraket, Hassan; El-Yazbi, Ahmed; Eid, Ali H.",Front.

We performed this retrospective cohort study to assess frequency, clinical characteristics, responsible pathogens, and outcomes of VAP in patients COVID-19 pneumonia requiring MV between March 12th and April 24th, 2020 (all had RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection). Patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ECMO were compared with an historical cohort of 45 patients with severe influenza-associated ARDS requiring ECMO admitted to the same ICU during the preceding three winter seasons. RESULTS: Among 50 consecutive patients with Covid-19-associated ARDS requiring ECMO included [median (IQR) age 48 (42-56) years; 72% male], 43 (86%) developed VAP [median (IQR) MV duration before the first episode, 10 (8-16) days]. VAP-causative pathogens were predominantly Enterobacteriaceae (70%), particularly inducible AmpC-cephalosporinase producers (40%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37%). VAP recurred in 34 (79%) patients and 17 (34%) died. Most recurrences were relapses (i.e., infection with the same pathogen), with a high percentage occurring on adequate antimicrobial treatment. Estimated cumulative incidence of VAP, taking into account death and extubation as competing events, was significantly higher in Covid-19 patients than in influenza patients (p = 0.002). Despite a high P. aeruginosa-VAP rate in patients with influenza-associated ARDS (54%), the pulmonary infection recurrence rate was significantly lower than in Covid-19 patients. Overall mortality was similar for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe Covid-19-associated ARDS requiring ECMO had a very high late-onset VAP rate. Inducible AmpC-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently caused VAP, with multiple recurrences and difficulties eradicating the pathogen from the lung.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Sahnoun, Tarek; Gautier, Melchior; Vidal, Pauline; Burrel, Sonia; Pineton de Chambrun, Marc; Chommeloux, Juliette; Desnos, Cyrielle; Arzoine, Jeremy; Nieszkowska, Ania; Bréchot, Nicolas; Schmidt, Matthieu; Hekimian, Guillaume; Boutolleau, David; Robert, Jérôme; Combes, Alain; Chastre, Jean",Ann Intensive Care,256,26

The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown measures have had far-reaching and quite diverse consequences for different social groups, and have increased the need for practical help, childcare, financial aid, but also emotional support to cope with the psychological consequences of social isolation. Hence, even individuals who are not traditionally receivers of informal help have suddenly become dependent on it. Existing research on volunteering, caregiving and donations has shown that the provision of help and volunteer work has a social gradient, and that social inequalities therein can partly be explained by reference to individuals’ attitudes and social networks. Against this backdrop, we ask: (1) Has the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the emergence of a new local solidarity? (2) What types of help are provided, and to whom? (3) How does socio-economic position affect the provision of different forms of help during the COVID-19 crisis? (4) Which sociological mechanisms can explain these inequalities in helping? Using data from a topical online-survey based on a quota sample which was collected, during the heydays of the first lockdown in Germany, we find that one of two respondents engages in some sort of local solidarity. Depending on the recipient and the way of helping – up to half of these helping arrangements has newly emerged and does not build on already existing (pre-crisis) help-arrangements. Differences between income and educational groups can mostly be explained by attitudes and social networks. Embeddedness in formal networks is particularly important for extending help to previously unknown recipients in the community. This article contributes to the literature on the social origins of help and the initiation of social capital during crises in general, and the political discussion about solidarity in the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. © 2021","Bertogg, A.; Koos, S.",Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,256,16

OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear. RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed the literature on OD and TD during the COVID-19 pandemic analyzing current data on pathogenesis and clinical correlates including prevalence, recovery rates, risk factors, and predictive power. Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic. SUMMARY: Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD. Recognizing inherent limitations of both subjective and objective OD and TD testing enables us better to manage chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, current mechanistic data suggest neurotropism of COVID-19 for olfactory neuro-epithelium and a potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Future studies are needed to explore further the neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19.","Rouadi, Philip W; Idriss, Samar A; Bousquet, Jean",Curr. opin. allergy clin. immunol,256,1

This study aimed to compare the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) versus whole body vibration (WBV) on healing of mandibular bone defects. Materials and Methods: A mandibular defect was created in 66 rats. The rats were randomly divided into two groups of rats. Each group was subdivided randomly by three groups (n = 11) as follows: (I) control group, (II) treatment with LIPUS, and (III) treatment with WBV. The radiographic changes in bone density, the ratio of lamellar bone to the entire bone volume, the ratio of the newly formed bone to the connective tissue and inflammation grade were evaluated after 1 and 2 months. Results: LIPUS significantly increased the radiographic bone density change compared to the control group at the first and second month postoperatively (p < 0.01). WBV only significantly increased the bone density compared to the control group at the second month after the surgery (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Application of LIPUS and WBV may enhance the regeneration of mandibular bone defects in rats. Although LIPUS and WBV are effective in mandibular bone healing, the effects of LIPUS are faster and greater than WBV.","Etemadi Sh, Milad; Hsieh, Nan-Chen; Movahed Mohammadi, Seyed Shahin; Momeni, Shahrooz; Razavi, Seyed Mohammad; Alizargar, Javad",Medicina (Kaunas),256,24

This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the ""3 Cs,"" namely, ""closed spaces with poor ventilation,"" ""crowded spaces with many people,"" and ""close contact."" In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings as one of the initial political actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of indoor environmental quality control, especially ventilation.","Azuma, Kenichi; Yanagi, U; Kagi, Naoki; Kim, Hoon; Ogata, Masayuki; Hayashi, Motoya",Environ Health Prev Med,256,24

In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies’ income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1% higher social inclusion is associated with a 0.153%–0.166% more pronounced decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the current crisis.","Santos, Luca J.; Oliveira, Alessandro V.

From March until late April, the number of cases increased exponentially. The delivery of anti-cancer therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was extremely challenging. In order to balance the benefits of continuing anti-cancer therapy with the associated increased hospital visits, combined with the risk of COVID-19 infection, we undertook a series of system changes in the delivery of cancer care. METHODS: Patients who attended our dayward over a 4-month period were included. Data were obtained from patient and chemotherapy prescribing records. Patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 at two separate timepoints: prior to their visit via telephone, and using a symptom questionnaire on arrival at the hospital. If patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, they were isolated and a viral swab arranged. RESULTS: A total of 456 patients attended from January 1st to April 30th. The numbers of visits from January to April were 601, 586, 575, and 607, respectively. During this period, there were 2369 patient visits to the dayward and 1953 (82%) intravenous regimens administered. Of the 416 visits that did not lead to treatment, 114 (27%) were scheduled non-treatment review visits, 194 (47%) treatments were held due to disease-related illness, and 108 (26%) treatments were held due to treatment-related complications. Screening measurements were implemented on March 18th due to rising COVID-19 prevalence in the general population. Overall, 53 treatments were held due to the screening process: 19 patients (36%) elicited COVID-19 symptoms via telephone screening; 34 patients (64%) were symptomatic in our pre-assessment area and referred for swabs, of which 4 were positive. Those with a negative swab were rescheduled for chemotherapy the following week. CONCLUSIONS: With careful systematic changes, safe and continued delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible.","Fitzpatrick, Orla; Ní Dhonaill, Roisin; Linehan, Anna; Coyne, Zac; Hennessy, Maeve; Clarke, Maeve; McGee, Elizabeth; Barrett, Fiona; O039,; Doherty, Deborah; Matassa, Carla; Doyle, Teresa; Christie, Allyson; Hennessy, Bryan; Grogan, Liam; Morris, Patrick G; Breathnach, Oscar S; Cowzer, Darren",Ir. j. med. sci,256,1

In Canada, Quebec had the highest COVID-19 burden and its earlier March school break, taking place two weeks before those in other provinces, could have shaped early transmission dynamics. METHODS: We combined a semi-mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with detailed surveillance data from Quebec and Ontario (initially accounting for 85% of Canadian cases) to explore the impact of case importation and timing of control measures on cumulative hospitalizations. RESULTS: A total of 1544 and 1150 cases among returning travelers were laboratory-confirmed in Quebec and Ontario, respectively (symptoms onset &#8804;03-25-2020). Hospitalizations could have been reduced by 55% (95% CrI: 51%-59%) if no cases had been imported after Quebec's March break. However, if Quebec had experienced Ontario's number of introductions, hospitalizations would have only been reduced by 12% (95% CrI: 8%-16%). Early public health measures mitigated the epidemic spread as a one-week delay could have resulted in twice as many hospitalizations (95% CrI: 1.7-2.1). CONCLUSION: Beyond introductions, factors such as public health preparedness, responses and capacity could play a role in explaining interprovincial differences. In a context where regions are considering lifting travel restrictions, coordinated strategies and proactive measures are to be considered.","Godin, Arnaud; Xia, Yiqing; Buckeridge, David L; Mishra, Sharmistha; Douwes-Schultz, Dirk; Shen, Yannan; Lavigne, Maxime; Drolet, Mélanie; Schmidt, Alexandra M; Brisson, Marc; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu",Int J Infect Dis,256,1

These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease. COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers, especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database, COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer. The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei) to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority of the COVID-QF framework.","Khashan, Eman A.; Eldesouky, Ali I.; Fadel, M.; Elghamrawy, Sally M.",,256,6

The natural products and phytochemical derived from plants are essential during a global health crisis. This class represents one of the most practical and promising approaches to decrease pandemic's intensity owing to their therapeutic potential. The present manuscript is therefore kept forth to give the researchers updated information on undergoing research in allied areas of natural product-based drug discovery, particularly for Covid-19 disease. The study briefly shreds evidence from in vitro and in silico researches done so far to find a lead molecule against Covid-19. Following this, we exhaustively explored the concept of chemical space and molecular similarity parameters for the drug discovery about the lead(s) generated from in silico-based studies. The comparison was drawn using FDA-approved anti-infective agents during 2015-2020 using key descriptors to evaluate druglike properties. The outcomes of results were further corroborated using Molecular Dynamics studies which suggested the outcomes in alignment with chemical space ranking. In a nutshell, current research work aims to provide a holistic strategic approach to drug design, keeping in view the identified phytochemicals against Covid-19.","Joshi, Gaurav; Sindhu, Jayant; Thakur, Shikha; Rana, Abhilash; Sharma, Geetika; Poduri, Ramarao",Food Chem Toxicol,256,7

National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N = 25,435). The main predictors were (1) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (2) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (3) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support-and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified-both positive.","Nisa, Claudia F; Bélanger, Jocelyn J; Faller, Daiane G; Buttrick, Nicholas R; Mierau, Jochen O; Austin, Maura M K; Schumpe, Birga M; Sasin, Edyta M; Agostini, Maximilian; Gützkow, Ben; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Abakoumkin, Georgios; Abdul Khaiyom, Jamilah Hanum; Ahmedi, Vjollca; Akkas, Handan; Almenara, Carlos A; Atta, Mohsin; Bagci, Sabahat Cigdem; Basel, Sima; Kida, Edona Berisha; Bernardo, Allan B I; Chobthamkit, Phatthanakit; Choi, Hoon-Seok; Cristea, Mioara; Csaba, Sára; Damnjanovic, Kaja; Danyliuk, Ivan; Dash, Arobindu; Di Santo, Daniela; Douglas, Karen M; Enea, Violeta; Fitzsimons, Gavan; Gheorghiu, Alexandra; Gómez, Ángel; Grzymala-Moszczynska, Joanna; Hamaidia, Ali; Han, Qing; Helmy, Mai; Hudiyana, Joevarian; Jeronimus, Bertus F; Jiang, Ding-Yu; Jovanovic, Veljko; Kamenov, Zeljka; Kende, Anna; Keng, Shian-Ling; Kieu, Tra Thi Thanh; Koc, Yasin; Kovyazina, Kamila; Kozytska, Inna; Krause, Joshua",Sci Rep,256,1

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. From electronic national registry data, we used Cox analysis and bootstrapping to evaluate associations between baseline levels of biomarkers and standardised absolute risks of death/ICU admission, adjusted for age and gender. SETTING: All hospitals in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 1310 patients aged &#8805;18 years admitted to hospital with COVID-19 from 27th of February to 1st of May 2020, with available biochemistry data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A composite of death/ICU admission occurring within 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 1310 patients admitted to hospital (54.6% men; median age 73.6 years), 352 (26.9%) experienced the composite endpoint and 263 (20.1%) died. For the composite endpoint, the absolute risks for moderately and severely elevated C reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher, 21.5% and 39.2%, respectively, compared with 5.0% for those with normal CRP. Moderately and severely elevated leucocytes were significantly higher, 34.5% and 46.6% risk, respectively, compared with 23.2% for those with normal leucocytes. Moderately and severely decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) were significantly higher, 41.5% and 45.9% risk, respectively, compared with 30.4% for those with normal/mildly decreased eGFR. Normal and elevated ureas were significantly higher, 22.3% and 40.6% risk, respectively, compared with 7.3% for those with low urea. Elevated D-dimer was significantly higher, 31.8% risk, compared with 17.5% for those with normal D-dimer. Moderately and severely elevated troponins were significantly higher, 27.7% and 57.3% risk, respectively, compared with 9.4% for those with normal troponin. Elevated procalcitonin was significantly higher, 52.1% risk, compared with 28.0% for those with normal procalcitonin. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study of patients admitted with COVID-19, elevated levels of CRP, leucocytes, procalcitonin, urea, troponins and D-dimer, and low levels of eGFR were associated with higher standardised absolute risk of death/ICU admission within 30 days.","Hodges, Gethin; Pallisgaard, Jannik; Schjerning Olsen, Anne-Marie; McGettigan, Patricia; Andersen, Mikkel; Krogager, Maria; Kragholm, Kristian; Køber, Lars; Gislason, Gunnar Hilmar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Bang, Casper N",BMJ Open,256,30

While most are intracellular and found in virtually all eukaryotic cells, there is a small group of organelles of elongated cylindrical shapes in highly specialized cells that protrude into the extracellular space, such as cilia, flagella, and microvilli. The ATP required by intracellular organelles is amply available in the cytosol, largely generated by mitochondria. However, such is not the case for cilia and flagella, whose slender structures cannot accommodate mitochondria. These organelles consume massive amounts of ATP to carry out high energy-demanding functions, such as sensory transduction or motility. ATP from the nearest mitochondria or other reactions within the cell body is severely limited by diffusion and generally insufficient to fuel the entire length of cilia and flagella. These organelles overcome this fuel restriction by local generation of ATP, using mechanisms that vary depending on the nutrients that are available in their particular external environment. Here, we review, with emphasis in mammals, the remarkable adaptations that cilia and flagella use to fuel their metabolic needs. Additionally, we discuss how a decrease in nutrients surrounding olfactory cilia might impair olfaction in COVID-19 patients.","Villar, Pablo S; Vergara, Cecilia; Bacigalupo, Juan",FEBS j,256,16

It has become a pandemic outbreak with more than 50 million confirmed infections and above 1 million deaths worldwide. In this study, we consider a mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission with the prosocial awareness effect. The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial awareness during the outbreak and compare this strategy with popular control measures. Results indicate that prosocial awareness has competitive potential to flatten the COVID-19 prevalence curve.","Ghosh, Indrajit; Martcheva, Maia",Nonlinear Dyn,256,2

As a result, the World Health Organization declared the virus a global public health crisis and a pandemic within 2 weeks, after the virus had spread to 114 countries with 118 000 recorded cases and 4291 deaths due to the virus and related complications. The World Health Organization declaration is indicative of the enormous impact of the pandemic on human life globally. South Africa has not been exempted from that impact. While the pandemic has affected all South Africans in various ways, the poor have been most affected due to structural inequality, poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to quality health care and other services. Furthermore, public mental health has also been negatively affected by the pandemic, and this comes against a backdrop of an ailing mental health care system. We argue that the psychology profession, as a mental health profession and behavioural science, working as part of a multidisciplinary team, ought to play a significant role in addressing the mental health ramifications of the pandemic. In so doing, lessons can be drawn from other countries while establishing contextual immediate and long-term interventions.

To evaluate the value of extending CT-KUB scan to include the chest area, in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute renal colic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods Retrospective data included; initial presentation, COVID-19-related symptoms, dose length product (DLP), scan extension, Ground glass appearance (GGO), Wuhan corona virus swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Results A total of 100 patients underwent CT KUB in April 2020 (Group 1) with a similar number of patients from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic randomly selected from August to October 2019 (Group 2). Patients age ranged from 15 to 91 years with a median of 48 years in Group 1, whilst in Group 2 the range was 19 to 85 years with a median of 50 years. All patients in both groups initially presented with renal colic. No COVID-19-related respiratory manifestations were recorded. Nine patients from Group 1 had GGO identified in their chest CT with all of them returning with negative COVID-19 swabs. Interestingly there was almost the same number of stones diagnosed 49% (49/ 100) in Group 1 patients compared with 50% (23/5150/100) from Group 2. Conclusions Despite the RCS COVID CT scan recommendations, our study has demonstrated no significant additional value of extending the CT-KUB to include the chest area in renal colic patients with no respiratory manifestations.

The daily median number of reports for methotrexate decreased from 28 in the pre-pandemic to 15 in the second pandemic time interval, with no considerable differences in other characteristics. The daily median number of reports for (hydroxy)chloroquine increased slightly from 1 in the pre-pandemic to 3 in the second pandemic time interval, while there were also changes in the demographics of cases and an increase in the proportion of cases reported by health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall reporting to FAERS did not change after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some stimulated reporting was observed for (hydroxy)chloroquine, highlighting the need for caution when conducting pharmacovigilance analyses with substances related to COVID-19.","Dörks, Michael; Jobski, Kathrin; Hoffmann, Falk; Douros, Antonios",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,256,21

These may be provided by either organized services and sources of informal social support. The latter are especially important since a lack of social support is associated with a lower level of psychological and physical well-being. During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks available to the elderly population during the pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability web-panel-based sample (n = 605). The ego networks were clustered by a hierarchical clustering approach for symbolic data. Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia has a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant. The results are particularly valuable for sustainable care policy planning, crisis intervention planning as well as any future waves of the coronavirus.","Cugmas, Marjan; Ferligoj, Anuska; Kogovsek, Tina; Batagelj, Zenel",PLoS One,256,16

The COVID-19 data (cumulative, confirmed cases and deaths), air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2) and meteorological data (temperature and relative humidity) were collected from January 2020 to August 2020 for all 28 states and the union territory of India during the pandemic. Now, to understand the relationship between air pollutant concentration, meteorological factor, and COVID-19 cases, the nonparametric Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlation were used. The COVID-19 shows a favourable temperature (0.55-0.79) and humidity (0.14-0.52) over the Indian region. The PM2.5 and PM10 gave a strong and negative correlation with COVID-19 cases in the range of 0.64-0.98. Similarly, the NO2 shows a strong and negative correlation in the range of 0.64-0.98. Before the lockdown, the concentration of pollution parameters is high due to the shallow boundary layer height. But after lockdown, the overall reduction was reported up to 33.67% in air quality index (AQI). The background metrological parameters showed a crucial role in the variation of pollutant parameters (SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5) and the COVID-19 infection with the economic aspects. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts derived monthly average wind speed was also plotted. It can see that January and February of 2020 show the least variation of air mass in the range of 1-2 m/s. The highest wind speed was reported during July and August 2020. India's western and southern parts experienced an air mass in the range of 4-8 m/s. The precipitation/wet deposition of atmospheric aerosols further improves the AQI over India. According to a study, the impact of relative humidity among all other metrological parameters is positively correlated with Cases and death.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective single arm phase I-II clinical trial enrolling patients &#8805; 50 years-old COVID-19 positive, at phase II or III with lung involvement at imaging study and oxygen requirement. Patients received 100 cGy to total lungs in a single fraction. Primary outcome was radiological response using severity and extension score on baseline CT, at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT. Secondary outcomes were toxicity using CTCAE v5, duration of hospitalization, blood work evolution and oxygen requirements using SatO2/ FiO2 index (SAFI), at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT . RESULTS: Nine patients were included. Median age was 66 (IQR 57-77). Severity score was stable or decreased in the third CT but no statistically significant (p=0.28), however, there were statistically significant changes in the extension score (p=0.03). SAFI index significantly improved 72 hours and 1 week after LD-RT (p=0.01). Inflammatory blood parameters decreased one week after RT compared with baseline, only LDH decreased significantly (p=0.04). Two patients presented grade 2 lymphopenia after RT and another worsened to grade 4 being its baseline grade 3. Overall, the median number of days of hospitalization was 59 days (range 26-151). After RT the median number of days in hospital was 13 days (4-77). With a median follow-up after RT of 112 days (105-150), seven patients were discharged and two patients died, one due to sepsis and the other with severe baseline COPD from COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show that LD-RT was a feasible and well-tolerated treatment, with potential clinical improvement. Randomized trials are needed to establish whether LD-RT improves severe pneumonia.","Sanmamed, N; Alcantara, P; Cerezo, E; Gaztañaga, M; Cabello, N; Gómez, S; Bustos, A; Doval, A; Corona, J; Rodriguez, G; Duffort, M; Ortuño, F; de Castro, J; Fuentes, M; Sanz, A; López, A; Vazquez, M",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,256,16

The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis making them potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the stem-loop II motif, a highly conserved noncoding RNA element. Based on our homology model we determined that the G to U transversion in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif (S2MG35U) forms a C-U base-pair isosteric to the C-G base-pair in the early 2000's SARS-CoV (S2M). In addition, chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S2MG35U conformational profile is altered compared to S2M in the apical loop region. We explored S2MG35U as a potential drug target by docking a library of FDA approved drugs. Enzymatic probing of the best docking ligands (aminoglycosides and polymyxins) indicated that polymyxin binding alters the conformational profile and/or secondary structure of the RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif conformational differences due to nucleotide transversion and ligand binding are highly significant and provide insight for future drug discovery efforts since the conformation of noncoding RNA elements affects their function.","Aldhumani, Ali H; Hossain, Md Ismail; Fairchild, Emily A; Boesger, Hannah; Marino, Emily C; Myers, Mason; Hines, Jennifer V",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,256,20

METHODS: We conducted a literature search on pandemic or outbreak management in forensic mental health settings, including gray literature sources, from 2000 to April 2020. We describe the evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak in our own facility, and the design, and staffing of a forensic isolation unit. RESULTS: We found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches. We experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive. One patient died. The outbreaks lasted for 41 days on each unit from declaration to resolution. We describe the approaches taken to reduction of infection risk, social distancing and changes to the care delivery model.

We used a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and a Modified Space-Time Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (MST-DBSCAN) to identify both space-time and transmission clusters, and estimated cluster duration, transmission behavior (emergence, growth, reduction, etc.) and relative risk. For each cluster, we computed the number of individuals, the median age of individuals and their viral load. Among the 1684 space-time clusters identified, 457 (27.1%) were significant (p &#8804; 0.05), such that they harbored a higher relative risk of infection within the cluster than compared to regions outside the cluster. Clusters lasted a median of 11 days (IQR 7-13) and included a median of 12 individuals per cluster (IQR 5-20). The majority of significant clusters (n = 260; 56.9%) had at least one person with an extremely high viral load (>1 billion copies/ml). Those clusters were considerably larger (median of 17 infected individuals, p < 0.001) than clusters with individuals showing a viral load below 1 million copies/ml (median of three infected individuals). The highest viral loads were found in clusters with the lowest average age group considered in the investigation, while clusters with the highest average age had low to middle viral load. In 20 significant clusters, the viral load of the three first cases was below 100,000 copies/ml, suggesting that subjects with fewer than 100,000 copies/ml may still be contagious. Notably, the dynamics of transmission clusters made it possible to identify three diffusion zones, which predominantly differentiated between rural and urban areas, the latter being more prone to persistence and expansion, which may result in the emergence of new clusters nearby. The use of geographic information is key for public health decision makers in mitigating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study suggests that early localization of clusters may help implement targeted protective measures limiting the spread of the virus.","Ladoy, Anaïs; Opota, Onya; Carron, Pierre-Nicolas; Guessous, Idris; Vuilleumier, Séverine; Joost, Stéphane; Greub, Gilbert",Sci Total Environ,256,21

Two patients had documented preexisting cognitive dysfunction; none had known dementia. Patients were evaluated at a mean of 43.2 (SD = 19.2) days after initial admission. In total, 50 patients (88%) had documented hypoxemic respiratory failure and 44 (77%) required intubation. Forty-six patients (81%) had cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe. Deficits were common in working memory (26/47 [55%] of patients), set-shifting (21/44 [47%]), divided attention (18/39 [46%]), and processing speed (14/35 [40%]). Executive dysfunction was not significantly associated with intubation length or the time from extubation to assessment, psychiatric diagnosis, or preexisting cardiovascular/metabolic disease. Attention and executive functions are frequently impaired in COVID-19 patients who require acute rehabilitation prior to discharge. Though interpretation is limited by lack of a comparator group, these results provide an early benchmark for identifying and characterizing cognitive difficulties after COVID-19. Given the frequency and pattern of impairment, easy-to-disseminate interventions that target attention and executive dysfunctions may be beneficial to this population.","Jaywant, Abhishek; Vanderlind, W Michael; Alexopoulos, George S; Fridman, Chaya B; Perlis, Roy H; Gunning, Faith M",Neuropsychopharmacol,256,1

However, established definitions of vulnerability typically involve only static concepts that are limited to measurement of system characteristics. Advancements in risk modeling, combined with the dynamic nature of data availability, and processing call for the need to understand the various dimensions and time-dependent properties of vulnerability within risk-informed decision making. There is need to: (1) Understand and classify aspects of vulnerability that exist in various systems, such as related to engineering, business, and healthcare, while recognizing both properties of the system and associated knowledge, (2) reconcile these definitions of vulnerabilities with existing concepts, such as sensitivity analysis and fragility, and (3) explore the implications of various types of vulnerability on risk management decisions. The main contributions of this work include classifying dynamic characteristics of system vulnerability and leveraging information about the multidimensional properties of vulnerability within risk management decisions that apply to a collection of risk events. As a proof of concept, we illustrate the vulnerability classification on the COVID-19 pandemic.

These late clinical manifestations have been termed Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and hypothesised to be associated with clinical severity in the acute infection phase and biochemical abnormalities. Aim: Evaluate the incidence of PASC in previously hospitalised COVID-19 patients and compare the admission and follow-up levels of biochemical parameters stratified according to baseline clinical severity. Methods: N = 168 COVID-19 patients previously hospitalised at the Zan Mitrev Clinic in Skopje, North Macedonia, with matched laboratory data at baseline and follow-up clinical visit > 30 days post-discharge, were stratified according to National Institute of Health clinical severity guidelines as mild, moderate, severe or critical according to admission clinical presentation. We assessed the incidence of PASC and compared the biochemical profile. Results: The median hospitalisation and clinical follow-up period were 11 (9-20) and 53 (30-105) days. The overall incidence of PASC was 56.5% (95/168); most PASC cases were confined to the severe sub-group (61/101, 61.4%). Contrary to mild and moderate cases and a healthy non-COVID-19 control cohort, we observed that severe COVID-19 cases experienced sustained biochemical disturbances, most notably elevated D-dimers and Ferritin of 600 ng/ml (283-1168) and 432 ng/ml (170-916), respectively. Conclusions: Previously hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 and prolonged biochemical disturbances, evident by abnormal values of D-dimers and Ferritin.","Simjanoska, Marija; Mitrev, Zan; Villa, Gianluca; Griffin, Daniel; Rosalia, Rodney",,256,16

To date, there has been no literature investigating the needs, knowledge, or implementation of osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT) as a supportive care option in pediatric oncology. We hypothesized that pediatric oncology clinicians, caregivers, and patients have (a) limited knowledge of OMT and (b) dissatisfaction with current supportive care options and (c) would be interested in having OMT available during chemotherapy, once educated. METHODS: Participants included three cohorts: (1) children aged &#8805; 9 years, diagnosed with cancer and actively receiving chemotherapy; (2) their caregivers; and (3) oncology clinicians at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Participants completed 1:1 semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for thematic content regarding their perception of supportive care measures and views on OMT. Quantitative data was summarized descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 60 participants completed the interview. Participants demonstrated limited awareness of osteopathic medicine; no participant had more than ""some"" knowledge of OMT. After education about OMT using a brief video, all clinicians, caregivers, and 95% of patients were receptive to OMT as a supportive care option. Major themes included the following: (a) patients have uncontrolled chemotherapy side effects, (b) improved supportive care options are desired, and (c) osteopathic medicine is a favorable supportive care adjunct. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncology clinicians, caregivers, and patients reported a need for better management of chemotherapy-associated side effects and an interest in utilizing OMT. These findings support further investigation into the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of implementing OMT in the pediatric oncology clinical setting.","Belsky, Jennifer A; Stanek, Joseph; Skeens, Micah A; Gerhardt, Cynthia A; Rose, Melissa J",Support. care cancer,256,26

Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well protected, due to their strategic role in patient management, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. Here, we present the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. METHODS: IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. Samples were collected after the first pandemic wave (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) and were analyzed by automated chemiluminescence assays. All samples were tested for IgG anti-S1/S2. Participant samples with negative or equivocal results but with analytical signals above the limit of detection and/or previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were also tested for IgG anti-Nucleocapsid. RESULTS: A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, among 341 participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 36 (10.55%) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (both S1/S2 and recombinant N antigen). CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the North Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was higher than in the general population in the same geographical area. Safety measures have to be stressed in order to protect these essential workers from future pandemic waves.","Barallat, Jaume; Fernández-Rivas, Gema; Quirant-Sánchez, Bibiana; González, Victoria; Doladé, Maria; Martinez-Caceres, Eva; Piña, Monica; Matllo, Joan; Estrada, Oriol; Blanco, Ignacio",PLoS One,256,16

The aim of this review was to establish the diagnostic capability of the existing serological tests in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Electronic research was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Cochrane Library, and only 10 articles, testing 10 different types of serological assays, met the inclusion criteria and were consequently submitted to quality assessment and data extraction. Quantitative data about the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value and IgM/IgG titer provided by each antibody test were reported in our review. Results: Almost all the serological tests used in the included items were recorded to ensure high sensitivity and specificity, identifying the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with certain COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed by RT-PCR) and in participants with suspected infection (SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnosis and/or RT-PCR negative subjects). Conclusions: Serological tests may represent reliable diagnostic tools in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they could be implemented complementary to real-time RT-PCR.","Carinci, Francesco; Moreo, Giulia; Limongelli, Luisa; Testori, Tiziano; Lauritano, Dorina",Appl.

The occurrence of bacterial infections and further antimicrobial treatment lead to the major crisis of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture. We have isolated diverse enterobacteriaceae groups which affect the goldfish and identified their response towards 46 antimicrobials of 15 different classes. Thirteen significant bacterial isolates such as Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus penneri, P. hauseri, Enterobacter cloacae, E. cancerogenus, E. ludwigii, Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Providencia vermicola were recovered from the infected fish with the Shannon-wiener diversity index of 2.556. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was found to be maximum for P. penneri (0.87) and minimum for C. freundii and E. cloacae (0.22), highlighting the hyper antibiotic selection pressure in the farm. The minimum concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit most of the resistant isolates was found to be > 256 mcg/ml. All the isolates were susceptible towards ciprofloxacin. Plasmid curing and further AMR tests could reveal the location of antibiotic resistance genes mainly as plasmids which determine the large extent of AMR spread through horizontal gene transfer. This study is the first of its kind to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterobacteriaceae recovered from goldfish, before and after plasmid curing.","Preena, P G; Dharmaratnam, Arathi; Raj, N Sundar; Raja, S Arun; Nair, Reshma R; Swaminathan, T Raja",Arch. microbiol,256,16

Compared to non-severe fevered patients, severe fevered patients showed a lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.000), a lower lymphocyte proportion (P = 0.000), and higher levels of CRP (P = 0.000). As determined by the multivariate analysis, CRP (OR 1.026, P = 0.018) and lymphocyte proportion (OR 0.924, P = 0.009) were significantly associated with the risk of developing severe events in fevered adult COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, ROC Curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for CRP combined with lymphocyte proportion to diagnose severe events in fevered adult COVID-19 patients was 0.874 (95% CI 0.820–0.927). Conclusions: Adult fevered COVID-19 patients were more likely to progress into severe cases, while CRP and lymphocyte proportion were effective predictors for developing severe events in these patients.","Wang, Guyi; Zhang, Quan; Wu, Chenfang; Wu, Fang; Yu, Bo; Lv, Jianlei; Zhang, Siye; Wu, Guobao; Zhong, Yanjun",Front.

Finally, we explored whether exposure to specific taxa within the indoor microbiota may explain the association between moisture damage and respiratory health. Schools were assessed for moisture damage through detailed inspections, and the microbial composition of settled dust in electrostatic dustfall collectors was determined using marker-gene analysis. In Finland, there were several positive associations between particular microbial indicators (diversity, richness, individual taxa) and a respiratory symptom score, while in the Netherlands, the associations tended to be mostly inverse and statistically non-significant. In Finland, abundance of the Sphingomonas bacterial genus and endotoxin levels partially explained the associations between moisture damage and symptom score.

281639,281639,281639,COVID-19 and cancer: A deadly pairing,15.323213,6.908144,2021,"RATIONALE: The peptide hormone angiotensin (Ang-(1-7)) has well-known anti-inflammatory protective effects, inhibiting production and expression of many cytokines and adhesion molecules that are associated with a ""cytokine storm."" Recent reports suggest that ARDS appears to be a significant predictor of mortality and the COVID-19-induced ""cytokine storm"" is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. PNA5, a more stable, longer acting, and more brain penetrant glycopeptide analog of Ang-(1-7), has been developed to control inflammation. Our studies were developed to test if Ang-(1-7) and its glycopeptide PNA5 were protective in the lung against overzealous immune responses to infectious and non-infectious respiratory stimuli. METHODS: Wild type mice were treated with infectious or non-infectious agents: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1x108, intranasal) or LPS (5 mg/kg body weight, oropharyngeal). Within 2 hrs of challenge, a subset of each was given either Ang-(1-7), PNA5, or peptide-free vehicle via different routes of administration: oropharyngeal or subcutaneous. Markers of inflammation in the lung were assessed within 72 hrs for each set of animals. RESULTS: During Mycoplasma infection, one high dose of Ang-(1-7) delivered to the lungs reduced neutrophilia and Muc5AC, as well as TNF-α and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC). In line with severe COVID-related ARDS, a single dose of the Ang-(1-7) analog, PNA5, delivered subcutaneously to LPS-challenged mice led to significant protection against key features of ARDS: vascular permeability and pulmonary edema, neutrophil influx into the lung and TNF-α production. CONCLUSIONS: Ang1-7 has been shown by others to play a protective role to a variety of stimuli in a myriad of organs. Our new findings demonstrate that Ang1-7 and PNA5 can protect against both live Mp and LPS-induced lung inflammation. Replacement of Ang-(1-7) in ALI/ARDS patients, including severe COVD-19 patients, with an Ang-(1-7) replacement peptide such as PNA5, could be ideal adjunctive therapy to treat ALI/ARDS and support lung health and organ protection.","Ledford, J.

This outbreak led to the demise of over 50 million domestic birds and occurred mainly during the northward spring migration of adult avian populations. OBJECTIVES: There have been no experimental examinations of the pathogenesis, transmission, and population impacts of this virus in adult wild waterfowl with varying exposure histories-the most relevant age class. METHODS: We captured, housed, and challenged adult wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with HPAIV H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 and measured viral infection, viral excretion, and transmission to other mallards. RESULTS: All inoculated birds became infected and excreted moderate amounts of virus, primarily orally, for up to 14 days. Cohoused, uninoculated birds also all became infected. Serological status had no effect on susceptibility. There were no obvious clinical signs of disease, and all birds survived to the end of the study (14 days). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, adult mallards are viable hosts of HPAIV H5N2 regardless of prior exposure history and are capable of transporting the virus over short and long distances. These findings have implications for surveillance efforts. The capture and sampling of wild waterfowl in the spring, when most surveillance programs are not operating, are important to consider in the design of future HPAIV surveillance programs.","Hall, Jeffrey S; Grear, Daniel A; Krauss, Scott; Seiler, J Patrick; Dusek, Robert J; Nashold, Sean W; Webster, Robert G",Influenza other respir. viruses,256,15

POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Triâ¢Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data ""clouds"" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high. AMR is projected to cause millions of deaths annually and cumulative financial loses in the trillions by 2050.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),256,33

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aim at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. The proposed model utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images, the visualizations of disease-related attention maps and useful clinical information to assist clinical decisions. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task for COVID-19, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. The extracted features are then combined with COVID-19 patient's vitals, lab tests and medical histories to predict the possibility of airway intubation in 72 hours, which is strongly associated with patient prognosis, and is crucial for patient care and hospital resource planning. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhong, Aoxiao; Li, Xiang; Wu, Dufan; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Kim, Younggon; Buch, Varun; Neumark, Nir; Bizzo, Bernardo; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Kim, Byung Seok; Chung, Woo Jin; Guo, Ning; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Li, Quanzheng",Med Image Anal,256,8

In addition, some management programs for critically ill COVID-19 patients are also based on experience with bacterial sepsis. However, some differences may exist between these two types of sepsis. Methods: This retrospective study investigated whether there are differences in the immune system status of these two types of sepsis. A total of 64 bacterial sepsis patients and 43 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sepsis were included in this study. Demographic data were obtained from medical records. Laboratory results within 24 h after the diagnosis of sepsis were provided by the clinical laboratory. Results: The results of blood routine (neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts), infection biomarkers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin levels), lymphocyte subset counts (total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts), and lymphocyte subset functions (the proportions of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated IFN-Î³ positive cells in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) were similar in bacterial sepsis patients and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. Cytokine storm was milder, and immunoglobulin and complement protein levels were higher in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. Conclusions: There are both similarities and differences in the immune system status of bacterial sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis. Our findings do not support blocking the cytokine storm or supplementing immunoglobulins in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis, at least in the early stages of the disease. Treatments for overactivation of the complement system and lymphocyte depletion may be worth exploring further.","Dong, Xijie; Wang, Chuntao; Liu, Xinghua; Gao, Wei; Bai, Xiangjun; Li, Zhanfei",Front Immunol,256,17

The impact generated is still difficult to estimate accurately. As doctors, we are just beginning to unravel the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical aspects of a new disease, while we are exposed to it on the frontline of care. The use of BDORT as an investigative tool in cases of diseases that are difficult to solve is part of the very development of the method by Prof. Omura and its principles are valid in cases of COVID 19, as well as in cases of neoplasms, neuropsychiatric disorders and so on. We have an invaluable resource that we must use in this fight but we need to understand how to get the most out of the method and explore the peculiarities of the moment. Methods The resonance phenomenon between identical substances is widely used in BDORT and we work based on this using microscopy images of the etiologic agent in different quantities, ranging from 1 to 200000 units, to estimate the viral load. Using the same principle, we also use images from Prevotella sp;vitrification lesions, histological images of arteritis and others. We also measured sixty-nine RCS parameters. The evaluation is done in printed photos of the patients and the records of the imaging patterns, measurement of RCS parameters and drug selection are written in these photos. The assessment of patients at a distance through photos is not a strange practice to BDORT and in the context of the pandemic it becomes even more valuable because it respects social distance. The sequential assessments documenting the evolution are archived and can at any time be the object of new studies and shared to exchange information. Findings We have observed over time the increase in viral load both in the environment and in patients and we consider this increase to be progressive and not yet stabilized. In the imaging patterns of individuals infected with SARS-Cov-2, there are areas of electromagnetic anomaly in various structures of the body where it was possible to check the resonance for UCV and measure the viral load. Unexpected findings in Imaging included vertical contamination in pregnant women, dysfunction of the thymus and the occurrence of high levels of UCV in the Cranial Imaging. This latest finding proved to be a longstanding contamination and it is too early to estimate its long-term effects, presence of residual injury or sequelae. These imaging patterns will be the subject of specific presentations. Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 appear to be correlated with remarkable alteration with remarkable alteration in inflammatory parameters, Thromboxane B2 and another RCS. Interpretation We are still beginning to learn about COVID-19 but research another RCS. Interpretation We are still beginning to learn about COVID-19 but research through BDORT brings valuable insights and is therefore now an indispensable support for clinical practice. BDORT allows a better diagnosis than other available resources and with proper evaluation we can treat it earlier, avoiding the progression of COVID-19 to severe forms. BDORT allows you to locate and quantify the infection in real time and this assessment allows you to understand the patient's response and monitor it safely. For this reason, we can not only choose the most effective interventions, but also introduce the precise therapeutic adjustments at an ideal time.","Ohara, G.; Iwasa, S.; De Prado, A.

The subsequent Covid-19 pandemic imposed unexpected disruptions to anatomical educational practice. Rapid change occurred due to government-imposed physical distancing regulations from March 2020 that increasingly restricted anatomy laboratory teaching practices. Anatomy educators in both these countries were mobilized to adjust their teaching approaches. This study on anatomy education disruption at pandemic onset within Australia and New Zealand adopts a social constructivist lens. The research question was ""What are the perceived disruptions and changes made to anatomy education in Australia and New Zealand during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reflected on by anatomy educators?."" Thematic analysis to elucidate ""the what and why"" of anatomy education was applied to these reflections. About 18 anatomy academics from ten institutions participated in this exercise. The analysis revealed loss of integrated ""hands-on"" experiences, and impacts on workload, traditional roles, students, pedagogy, and anatomists' personal educational philosophies. The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise, and adapt and continuity planning. There is no doubt that anatomy education has stepped into a yet unknown future in the island countries of Australia and New Zealand.","Pather, Nalini; Blyth, Phil; Chapman, Jamie A; Dayal, Manisha R; Flack, Natasha A M S; Fogg, Quentin A; Green, Rodney A; Hulme, Anneliese K; Johnson, Ian P; Meyer, Amanda J; Morley, John W; Shortland, Peter J; Strkalj, Goran; Strkalj, Mirjana; Valter, Krisztina; Webb, Alexandra L; Woodley, Stephanie J; Lazarus, Michelle D",Anat Sci Educ,256,16

Amongst different possible therapies for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ozone therapy seems to have an immunological role because of the modulation of cytokines and interferons, including the induction of gamma interferon. Some data suggest the possible role of ozone therapy in SARS, either as a monotherapy or, more realistically, as an adjunct to standard treatment regimens; therefore, there is increasing interest in the role of ozone therapy in COVID-19 treatment The PubMed and Scopus databases and the Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy website were used to identify articles focused on ozone therapy. The search was limited to articles published from January 2011 to July 2020. Of 280 articles found on ozone therapy, 13 were selected and narratively reviewed. Ozone exerts antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral replication and direct inactivation of viruses. Ozone is an antiviral drug enhancer and is not an alternative to antiviral drugs. Combined treatment with involving ozone and antivirals demonstrated a reduction in inflammation and lung damage. The routes of ozone administration are direct intravenous, major autohaemotherapy and extravascular blood oxygenation-ozonation. Systemic ozone therapy seems useful in controlling inflammation, stimulating immunity and as antiviral activity and providing protection from acute coronary syndromes and ischaemia reperfusion damage, thus suggesting a new methodology of immune therapy. Systemic ozone therapy in combination with antivirals in COVID-19-positive patients may be justified, helpful and synergic.","Cattel, Francesco; Giordano, Susanna; Bertiond, Cecilia; Lupia, Tommaso; Corcione, Silvia; Scaldaferri, Matilde; Angelone, Lorenzo; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe",Virus Res,256,16

To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects who were not hospitalized.

This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4 ± 5.8 kg/m2. Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06-1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02-1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). However, our results showed a reduction in sleeping hours among those exposed to COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94; P < 0.01).

We aimed to examine whether non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus enhances the risk of virus infections compared with the risk in healthy individuals without non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed case-control and cohort studies on the association between non-autoimmune diabetes and viruses. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science with no language restriction, to identify articles published until February 15, 2021. The main outcome assessment was the risk of virus infection in individuals with non-autoimmune diabetes. We used a random-effects model to pool individual studies and assessed heterogeneity (I2) using the &#967;2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019134142. Out of 3136 articles identified, we included 68 articles (90 studies, as the number of virus and or diabetes phenotype varied between included articles). The summary OR between non-autoimmune diabetes and virus infections risk were, 10.8(95% CI: 10.3-11.4; 1-study) for SARS-CoV-2; 3.6(95%CI: 2.7-4.9, I2 = 91.7%; 43-studies) for HCV; 2.7(95% CI: 1.3-5.4, I2 = 89.9%, 8-studies;) for HHV8; 2.1(95% CI: 1.7-2.5; 1-study) for H1N1 virus; 1.6(95% CI: 1.2-2.13, I2 = 98.3%, 27-studies) for HBV; 1.5(95% CI: 1.1-2.0; 1-study) for HSV1; 3.5(95% CI: 0.6-18.3 , I2 = 83.9%, 5-studies) for CMV; 2.9(95% CI: 1-8.7, 1-study) for TTV; 2.6(95% CI: 0.7-9.1, 1-study) for Parvovirus B19; 0.7(95% CI: 0.3-1.5 , 1-study) for coxsackie B virus; and 0.2(95% CI: 0-6.2; 1-study) for HGV. Our findings suggest that, non-autoimmune diabetes is associated with increased susceptibility to viruses especially SARS-CoV-2, HCV, HHV8, H1N1 virus, HBV and HSV1. Thus, these viruses deserve more attention from diabetes health-care providers, researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders for improved detection, overall proper management, and efficient control of viruses in people with non-autoimmune diabetes.","Lontchi-Yimagou, Eric; Feutseu, Charly; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Djomkam Zune, Alexandra Lindsey; Kinyuy Ekali, Solange Fai; Nguewa, Jean Louis; Choukem, Siméon Pierre; Mbanya, Jean Claude; Gautier, Jean Francois; Sobngwi, Eugene",Sci Rep,256,16

METHODS: A mannequin was connected to an active lung simulator. The inspiratory and expiratory variations in airways pressure observed with a high simulated effort, were determined relative to the preset CPAP level. NIV was applied in Pressure Support Mode at two simulated respiratory rates and two cycling-off flow thresholds. During the bench study, we measured the variables defining patient-ventilator interaction and performance. RESULTS: During nCPAP, the tested interfaces did not show significant differences in terms of &#8710;Pawi and &#8710;Pawe. During NIV, the snorkeling mask demonstrated a better patient-ventilator interaction compared to FFM, as shown by significantly shorter Pressurization Time and Expiratory Trigger Delay (p < 0.01), but no significant differences were found in terms of Inspiratory Trigger Delay and Time of Synchrony between the interfaces tested. At RR 20sim, the snorkeling mask presented the lower &#916;Ptrigger (p < 0.01), moreover during all the conditions tested the snorkeling mask showed the longer Pressure Time Product at 200, 300, and 500 ms compared to FFM (p < 0.01). A major limitation of snorkeling mask is that during NIV with this interface it is possible to reach maximum 18 cmH2O of peak inspiratory pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The modified snorkeling mask can be used as an acceptable alternative to other interfaces for both nCPAP and NIV in emergencies.","Ferrone, Giuliano; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Costa, Roberta; Gullì, Antonio; Scapigliati, Andrea; Antonelli, Massimo; Conti, Giorgio","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",256,21

Objective: To identify and quantify the association of race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities of state-specific lockdowns with 6 well-being dimensions in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled, repeated cross-sectional study used data from 14â¯187â¯762 households who participated in phase 1 of the population-representative US 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Households were invited to participate by email, text message, and/or telephone as many as 3 times. Data were collected via an online questionnaire from April 23 to July 21, 2020, and participants lived in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Indicators of race/ethnicity, sex, and income and their intersections. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unemployment; food insufficiency; mental health problems; no medical care received for health problems; default on last month's rent or mortgage; and class cancellations with no distance learning. Race/ethnicity, sex, income, and their intersections were used to measure distributional implications across historically marginalized populations; state-specific, time-varying population mobility was used to measure lockdown intensity. Logistic regression models with pooled repeated cross-sections were used to estimate risk of dichotomous outcomes by social group, adjusted for confounding variables. Results: The 1â¯088â¯314 respondents (561â¯570 [51.6%; 95% CI, 51.4%-51.9%] women) were aged 18 to 88 years (mean [SD], 51.55 [15.74] years), and 826â¯039 (62.8%; 95% CI, 62.5%-63.1%) were non-Hispanic White individuals; 86â¯958 (12.5%; 95% CI, 12.4%-12.7%), African American individuals; 86â¯062 (15.2%; 95% CI, 15.0%-15.4%), Hispanic individuals; and 50â¯227 (5.6%; 95% CI, 5.5%-5.7%), Asian individuals. On average, every 10% reduction in mobility was associated with higher odds of unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), food insufficiency (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), mental health problems (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), and class cancellations (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). Across most dimensions compared with White men with high income, African American individuals with low income experienced the highest risks (eg, food insufficiency, men: OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7; mental health problems, women: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.8-2.1; medical care inaccessibility, women: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.9; unemployment, men: OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2; rent/mortgage defaults, men: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 4.7-7.1). Other high-risk groups were Hispanic individuals (eg, unemployment, Hispanic men with low income: OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5-3.4) and women with low income across all races/ethnicities (eg, medical care inaccessibility, non-Hispanic White women: OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, African American and Hispanic individuals, women, and households with low income had higher odds of experiencing adverse outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Blanket public health policies ignoring existing distributions of risk to well-being may be associated with increased race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities.","Chakrabarti, Suman; Hamlet, Leigh C; Kaminsky, Jessica; Subramanian, S V",JAMA Netw Open,256,16

To determine whether a person has touched an object or surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the 2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency. Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in a meeting room using the contact information.","Zhang, Pan; Calderon, Wilfredo Torres; Lee, Bokyung; Tessier, Alex; Bibliowicz, Jacky; Calin, Liviu; Lee, Michael",,256,21

Cancer therapy provision has been particularly impacted due to many therapies having immunosuppressive side effects and/or their need for hospital administration. NHS England (NHSE) and the Scottish National Cancer Advisory Medicines Group (NCMAG) have both provided interim treatment recommendations to provide direction for oncologists during this pandemic. This research evaluates these NHSE and NCMAG treatment proposals. Methods: All interim cancer treatment proposals made under NHSE and NCMAG were extracted and compared with the corresponding product label and any NICE/SMC HTA guidance (on 30-Dec-2020). Results: NCMAG made 18 interim cancer treatment proposals (last updated 10-NOV-2020). 33% were for off-label use, 17% were on-label therapies without SMC-recommendations (all manufacturer non-submissions), 11% were for use outside of SMC reimbursement restrictions, 11% related to supportive care, 11% restricted dosing, and 6% stopped use of one drug in favor of another. NHSE have endorsed 48 interim treatment options (last updated 20-NOV-2020). 40% were for off-label use, 19% stopped use of one drug in favor of another, 9% simply stopped use of a drug, 9% were for therapies that were ongoing NICE assessment (half of which were subsequently NICE-recommended), 9% were for on-label therapies that were not NICE-recommended nor undergoing assessment, 9% were treatment dosing modifications (i.e. duration/frequency/combination), and 5% related to supportive care. 33% of proposals by NCMAG had corresponding recommendations by NHSE. Conclusions: In England and Scotland, rapid interim treatment guidance has provided physicians with a greater flexibility in treating patients with cancer with the guidance most commonly focusing on allowing use of certain therapies outside their labels or their SMC/NICE reimbursement restrictions. There is a lack of alignment between England and Scotland, which can only likely be partially explained by differences in drugs recommended by NICE and SMC","Macaulay, R.",Value in Health,256,1

The aim of this study was to describe the association between nutritional risk and length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. METHODS: a retrospective cohort of ventilated, critically ill patients. We assessed nutrition risk at baseline using NUTRIC-score. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between NUTRIC-score and clinical outcomes (days on mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality). A survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: a total of 112 patients were included, 39.3 % were overweight and 47.3 % were obese. Based on NUTRIC-Score, 66 % and 34 % of patients were at high and low nutritional risk, respectively. High nutritional risk was associated with increased mortality risk (OR: 2.4, 95 % CI, 1.06-5.47, p = 0.036) and higher 28-day mortality (HR: 2.05, 95 % CI, 1.01-4.23, p = 0.04) in comparison with low risk. CONCLUSION: high nutritional risk is related to mortality in SARS-COV-2 critically ill patients. Overweight and obesity are common in this sample.

For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use digital peer support technology. METHODS: The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. RESULTS: Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists' capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. CONCLUSIONS: The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","Fortuna, Karen L; Myers, Amanda L; Walsh, Danielle; Walker, Robert; Mois, George; Brooks, Jessica M",JMIR Ment Health,256,1

Motivated by applied state-level opioid policy evaluations, this simulation study compares statistical performance of multiple variations of two-way fixed effect models traditionally used for DID under a range of simulation conditions. While most linear models resulted in minimal bias, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to 160%). Further, root mean square error is minimized by linear AR models when examining crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when examining raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (<10%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy effectiveness. When considering performance across models, the linear autoregressive models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates. These findings highlight notable limitations of traditional statistical models commonly used for DID designs, designs widely used in opioid policy studies and in state policy evaluations more broadly.","Griffin, Beth Ann; Schuler, Megan S.; Stuart, Elizabeth A.; Patrick, Stephen; McNeer, Elizabeth; Smart, Rosanna; Powell, David; Stein, Bradley D.; Schell, Terry; Pacula, Rosalie L.",,256,14

Advanced stage patients of EC have poor prognosis. Inevitable side effects and treatment tolerance of chemotherapy for EC remain to be addressed. Our results in this study showed that EC cells with higher tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) expression have lower sensitivity to poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors. Upon TRAF4 knockdown, the colony numbers of EC cells were markedly down-regulated, and the markers of DNA double-strand breakage were significantly up-regulated after the treatment of olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor. TRAF4 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), promoted DNA double-strand breakage, and decreased levels of DNA repair related proteins, including phosphorylated-DNA-dependent protein kinase (p-DNA-PK) and RAD51 recombinase (RAD51). In addition, TRAF4's effect on the sensitivity of EC cells to olaparib was further found to be mainly mediated by Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, in vivo results showed that TRAF4 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of EC to PARP1 inhibitors using a mouse xenograft model. Collectively, our data suggest that combined application of TRAF4 knockdown and PARP1 inhibition can be used as a promising strategy for synthetic lethality in EC treatment.","Tang, Liulin; Wang, Min; Jiang, Li; Zeng, Chengying",Hum. cell,256,24

Experimental studies have revealed a few evidences that coronavirus decayed quickly under the exposure of heat and humidity. This study aims to carry out an epidemiological investigation to establish the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 in high risk areas of the United States (U.S.). We analyzed daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven meteorological measures in top 50 U.S. counties with the most accumulative confirmed cases from March 22, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Our analyses indicate that each meteorological factor and COVID-19 more likely have a nonlinear association rather than a linear association over the wide ranges of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation observed. Average temperature, minimum relative humidity, and precipitation were better predictors to address the meteorological impact on COVID-19. By including all the three meteorological factors in the same model with their lagged effects up to 3 days, the overall impact of the average temperature on COVID-19 was found to peak at 68.45 °F and decrease at higher degrees, though the overall relative risk percentage (RR %) reduction did not become significantly negative up to 85 °F. There was a generally downward trend of RR % with the increase of minimum relative humidity; nonetheless, the trend reversed when the minimum relative humidity exceeded 91.42%. The overall RR % of COVID-19 climbed to the highest level of 232.07% (95% confidence interval = 199.77, 267.85) with 1.60 inches of precipitation, and then started to decrease. When precipitation exceeded 1.85 inches, its impact on COVID-19 became significantly negative. Our findings alert people to better have self-protection during the pandemic rather than expecting that the natural environment can curb coronavirus for human beings.","Chien, Lung-Chang; Chen, Lung-Wen",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,256,27

PURPOSE: To present the clinical and radiological outcomes a minimum of 10 years after surgery in a consecutive series of patients who underwent MACI in the tibiofemoral or patellofemoral knee joint. Secondly, to investigate any association between outcomes and patient characteristics, graft parameters, and injury and surgery history. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Overall, 87 patients (99 grafts: 57 medial femoral condyle, 24 lateral femoral condyle, 11 trochlea, 7 patella) were prospectively evaluated clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery and at 2, 5, and minimum 10 years after MACI (mean, 13.1 years; range, 10.5-16 years). Patients were evaluated with a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and patient satisfaction. The 6-minute walk test, active knee range of motion, and peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength were assessed. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for strength measures. MRI was undertaken to evaluate the repair tissue, and an MRI composite score was calculated. RESULTS: All PROMs significantly improved (P < .05) over the pre- to postoperative period. Apart from KOOS Sport (P = .018) and the LSI for peak isokinetic knee extensor strength (P = .005), which significantly improved, no significant change (P > .05) was observed from 2 years after surgery to final follow-up (range, 10.5-16 years) in all other PROMs, 6-minute walk distance, active knee range of motion, and the LSI for peak isokinetic knee flexor strength. At final follow-up, while the mean LSIs for peak isokinetic knee flexor and extensor strength were 96.9% and 95.7%, respectively, 74.7% of patients were satisfied with their ability to participate in sports, and 88.5% were satisfied overall. A nonsignificant decline was observed for tissue infill (P = .211) and the MRI composite score (P = .099) from 2 years to final review. At final MRI review, 9 grafts (9.1%) had failed. While no significant association (P > .05) was observed between clinical or MRI-based outcomes and patient demographics (age, body weight, body mass index), defect size, or the duration of preoperative symptoms, the number of previous surgical procedures was significantly and negatively associated with KOOS Symptoms (P = .015), KOOS Sport (P = .011), and the degree of tissue infill (P = .045). CONCLUSION: MACI provided high levels of satisfaction and adequate graft survivorship as visualized on MRI at 10.5 to 16 years after surgery.","Ebert, Jay R; Fallon, Michael; Wood, David J; Janes, Gregory C",Am J Sports Med,256,16

The impact on the adult population has been disproportionately higher when compared to children with consequent challenges to organ donation and liver transplantation (LT). Across the three UK paediatric liver centres there has only been a very small number of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and all made a speedy and full recovery. We report here the response during the pandemic across the 3 paediatric LT centres.MethodsA series of nationally agreed policy changes affecting the liver procurement, listing and transplant process were agreed during regular meetings with LT centre directors and NHSE. Actions at a local and national level were agreed to protect and maintain the paediatric LT programmes.Data were collected from 27/03/20 until 26/11/20 and compared with same time period for the years 2016–19.ResultsDuring the study period, there was a significant reduction in the adult population in the mean number of weekly liver offers, donors and LTs compared to before the pandemic with signs of recovery between the 1st and 2nd UK lockdown periods (figure 1). More specifically the number of livers offered nationally was reduced from an average 30–40/week to only &lt;10/week during the 1st wave in the March-April period. The number of children on the LT list during the study period across all 3 centres was 74 in total with 17 (23%) super-urgent and 57(77%) electives, which was comparable to previous years.Overall, 65–80 paediatric LTs are performed annually across the UK’s 3 paediatric centres. From March-November 2020 there were 58(82%) elective and 13(18%) super urgent (acute liver failure & hepatoblastoma) paediatric LTs performed.Donor Brain Dead (DBD) and Donor Cardiac Dead (DCDC) LTs were 54(76%) and 3(4%), respectively. Living related LT (LRLT) programme was sustained comprising 20% of LTs performed.The number of paediatric LTs performed during the pandemic was comparable to those performed yearly since 2016. The number of LT per paediatric centre for King’s College Hospital (KCH), Birmingham Children’s Hospital (BCH) and Leeds Liver Unit were 40 (56%), 15(21%) and 16(23%), respectively with excellent outcome. A 15-year-old girl from KCH diagnosed with Wilson disease presented with liver failure and became COVID-19 positive whilst listed. She underwent LT soon after becoming COVID-19 negative. No perioperative mortality was reported with excellent outcome so far in all.ConclusionThe current COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the UK adult LT programme. The paediatric programme LT was preserved despite a decrease in organ offering and retrieval nationally plus limitations on adult intensive care resources at a regional level. Overall, paediatric LT outcome remained very good.","Grammatikopoulos, Tassos Taylor Rhiannon Whitney Julie Hartley Jane Attia Magdy Mirza Darius Rajwal Sanjay Watson Sarah Isaac John Manas Derek Heaton Nigel Dhawan Anil Forsythe John Thorburn Douglas",Frontline Gastroenterology,256,4

METHODS: All patients scheduled for elective urological procedures for malignant or benign diseases at 2 high-volume centers were administered a questionnaire, through structured telephone interviews, between April 24 and 27, 2020. The questionnaire included 3 questions: (1) In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, would you defer the planned surgical intervention? (2) If yes, when would you be willing to undergo surgery? (3) What do you consider potentially more harmful for your health: the risk of contracting COVID-19 during hospitalization or the potential consequences of delaying surgical treatment? RESULTS: Overall, 332 patients were included (51.5% and 48.5% in the oncology and benign groups, respectively). Of these, 47.9% patients would have deferred the planned intervention (33.3% vs 63.4%; P < .001), while the proportion of patients who would have preferred to delay surgery for more than 6 months was comparable between the groups (87% vs 80%). These answers were influenced by patient age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score (in the Oncology group) and by the underlying urological condition (in the benign group). Finally, 182 (54.8%) patients considered the risk of COVID-19 potentially more harmful than the risk of delaying surgery (37% vs 73%; P < .001). This answer was driven by patient age and the underlying disease in both groups.

METHODS: Patient data for a three-week period was prospectively collected for ESU patients during lockdown period and compared to the ESU workload for the same time period prior to lockdown. RESULTS: Surgical emergencies admissions reduced by 2.5 times during our study period (p value = 0.001). In this changed paradigm, the overall number of surgical emergencies were reduced. A high mortality (n = 4, 5.7%) was noted during lockdown period as compared to pre-lockdown period (n = 1, 0.58%, p value = 0.025). Almost half of surgical admissions were tested for COVID-19 based on their symptoms and more than third (n=14, 38.9%) of them were positive. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in COVID-19 positive group (85.7%) and only a third (36%) of COVID-19 positive patients needed surgical attention. Chest x-ray findings were comparable to PCR testing in terms of sensitivity and specificity but CT chest was more sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: It remains unclear how COVID-19 reduced surgical emergencies. A significant proportion of COVID-19 presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. In a new outbreak all General Surgical patients should be tested with CRP and WCC used as a triage adjunct.

SCOPO DELLO STUDIO: È di definire la variazione del carico di lavoro dell’unità chirurgica di emergenza (ESU) durante la pandemia COVID-19 sono stati raccolti prospetticamente i dati dei pazienti per un periodo di tre settimane per i pazienti dell’unita di emergenza chirurgica durante il periodo di blocco e confrontati con il carico di lavoro della stessa Unità per lo stesso periodo di tempo prima del blocco. RISULTATI: I ricoveri per emergenze chirurgiche si sono ridotti di 2,5 volte durante il nostro periodo di studio (valore p = 0,001). In questo scenario cambiato, il numero complessivo di emergenze chirurgiche si è ridotto. Durante il periodo di blocco è stata osservata un’elevata mortalità (n = 4, 5,7%) rispetto al periodo di preblocco (n = 1, 0,58%, valore p = 0,025). Quasi la metà dei ricoveri chirurgici sono stati controllati per COVID- 19 in base ai loro sintomi e più di un terzo (n = 14, 38,9%) è risultato positivo. I sintomi gastrointestinali erano comuni nel gruppo positivo per COVID-19 (85,7%) e solo un terzo (36%) dei pazienti positivi per COVID-19 necessitava di cure chirurgiche. I risultati della radiografia del torace erano paragonabili al test PCR in termini di sensibilità e specificità, ma la TC del torace era più sensibile. CONCLUSIONI: Non è chiaro come COVID-19 abbia ridotto le emergenze chirurgiche. Una percentuale significativa di COVID-19 presentava sintomi gastrointestinali. In una nuova epidemia tutti i pazienti di chirurgia generale dovrebbero essere testati con CRP e WCC usati come coadiuvanti del triage.","Zafar, N.; Kashora, F.; Qurashi, K.; Al-Musawi, J.; Watfah, J.; Liasis, L.; Sen, M.; Gould, S.; J Vaizey, C.; Warusavitarne, J.; Leo, C.

Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","Fenwick, Craig; Croxatto, Antony; Coste, Alix T; Pojer, Florence; André, Cyril; Pellaton, Céline; Farina, Alex; Campos, Jérémy; Hacker, David; Lau, Kelvin; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Gonseth Nussle, Semira; Bochud, Murielle; D039,; Acremont, Valerie; Trono, Didier; Greub, Gilbert; Pantaleo, Giuseppe",J. virol,256,16

SUMMARY ANSWER: Two PIs, lopinavir and darunavir, currently offered as cART options in HIV-positive pregnancies were evaluated, and we found that lopinavir-based cART, but not darunavir-based cART, impaired uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling in both human ex vivo and mouse in vivo experimental models. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Early initiation of cART is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV. However, poor birth outcomes are frequently observed in HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to PI-based cART, especially when it is initiated prior to conception. The correlation between early initiation of PI-cART and adverse birth outcomes is poorly understood, due to lack of data on the specific effects of PI-cART on the early stages of pregnancy involving uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Lopinavir and darunavir were evaluated in clinically relevant combinations using an ex vivo human first-trimester placenta-decidua explant model, an in vitro human primary decidual cell culture system, and an in vivo mouse pregnancy model. The first-trimester (gestational age, 6-8 weeks) human placenta-decidua tissue was obtained from 11 to 15 healthy women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. C57Bl/6 female mice (four/treatment group) were administered either lopinavir-cART, darunavir-cART or water by oral gavage once daily starting on the day of plug detection until sacrifice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human: Spiral artery remodeling was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of first-trimester placenta-decidua explant co-culture system. Trophoblast migration was measured using a placental explant culture. A primary decidual cell culture was used to evaluate the viability of immune cell populations by flow cytometry. Soluble factors, including biomarkers of decidualization and angiogenesis, were quantified by ELISA and Luminex assay using decidua-conditioned media. Mouse: In the mouse pregnancy model, gestational day 6.5 or 9.5 implantation sites were used to assess decidualization, spiral artery remodeling and uterine natural killer (uNK) cell numbers by immunohistochemistry. Transcription factor STAT3 was assayed by immunohistochemistry in both human decidua and mouse implantation sites. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, impaired uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling in both experimental models. Lopinavir-cART treatment was also associated with selective depletion of uNK cells, reduced trophoblast migration and defective placentation. The lopinavir-associated decidualization defects were attributed to a decrease in expression of transcription factor STAT3, known to regulate decidualization. Our results suggest that periconceptional initiation of lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, causes defective maturation of the uterine endometrium, leading to impairments in spiral artery remodeling and placentation, thus contributing to the poor birth outcomes. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The human first-trimester placenta/decidua samples could only be obtained from healthy females undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. As biopsy is the only way to obtain first-trimester decidua from pregnant women living with HIV on PI-cART, ethics approval and participant consent are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, our animal model is limited to the study of cART and does not include HIV. HIV infection is also associated with immune dysregulation, inflammation, alterations in angiogenic factors and complement activation, all of which could influence decidual and placental vascular remodeling and modify any cART effects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings provide mechanistic insight with direct clinical implications, rationalizing why the highest adverse birth outcomes are reported in HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to lopinavir-cART from conception. We demonstrate that dysregulation of decidualization is the mechanism through which lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, use in early pregnancy leads to poor birth outcomes. Although lopinavir is no longer a first-line regimen in pregnancy, it remains an alternate regimen and is often the only PI available in low resource settings. Our results highlight the need for reconsidering current guidelines recommending lopinavir use in pregnancy and indicate that lopinavir should be avoided especially in the first trimester, whereas darunavir is safe to use and should be the preferred PI in pregnancy.Further, in current times of the COVID-19 pandemic, lopinavir is among the top drug candidates which are being repurposed for inclusion in clinical trials world-over, to assess their therapeutic potential against the dangerous respiratory disease. Current trials are also testing the efficacy of lopinavir given prophylactically to protect health care workers and people with potential exposures. Given the current extraordinary numbers, these might include women with early pregnancies, who may or may not be cognizant of their gestational status. This is a matter of concern as it could mean that women with early pregnancies might be exposed to this drug, which can cause decidualization defects. Our findings provide evidence of safety concerns surrounding lopinavir use in pregnancy, that women of reproductive age considering participation in such trials should be made aware of, so they can make a fully informed decision.

Here, we report on the sero-prevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), mayaro virus (MAYV) and zika virus (ZIKV) in a swamp community in Zambia. METHODS: We collected blood and saliva samples from residents of Lukanga swamps in 2016 during a mass-cholera vaccination campaign. Over 10,000 residents were vaccinated with two doses of Shanchol&#8482; during this period. The biological samples were collected prior to vaccination (baseline) and at specified time points after vaccination. We tested a total of 214 baseline stored serum samples for IgG antibodies against NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and E2 of CHIKV and MAYV on ELISA. We defined sero-prevalence as the proportion of participants with optical density (OD) values above a defined cut-off value, determined using a finite mixture model. RESULTS: Of the 214 participants, 79 (36.9%; 95% CI 30.5-43.8) were sero-positive for Chikungunya; 23 (10.8%; 95% CI 6.9-15.7) for Zika, 36 (16.8%; 95% CI 12.1-22.5) for Dengue and 42 (19.6%; 95% CI 14.5-25.6) for Mayaro. Older participants were more likely to have Zika virus whilst those involved with fishing activities were at greater risk of contracting Chikungunya virus. Among all the antigens tested, we also found that Chikungunya saliva antibody titres correlated with baseline serum titres (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.222; p = 0.03).

We used data on the number notified cases accumulated per district by May 18, 2020. The spatial dependence of the spatially smoothed incidence rate was investigated through the analysis of univariate local spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I. To evaluate the spatial association between the INC_EBS and the determinants SAL, POP>60Y and SLUMS, we used the local bivariate Moran's I. The results showed that the spatially smoothed incidence rate for COVID-19 presented significant spatial autocorrelation (I = 0.333; P<0.05), indicating that the cases were concentrated in clusters of neighbouring districts. The INC_EBS showed a negative spatial association with SAL (I = -0.253, P<0.05) and POP>60Y (I = -0.398, P<0.05). We also found that the INC_EBS showed a positive spatial association with households located in the slums (I = 0.237, P<0.05). Our study concluded that the households where the population most vulnerable to COVID-19 resides were spatially distributed in the districts with lower salaries, higher percentages of slums and lower percentages of the population above 60 years of age.","Ferreira, Marcos César",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),256,5

The cells comprising the immune response are traditionally divided into two major subsets, innate and adaptive, with particular characteristics for each type. Type I natural killer T (iNKT) cells are defined as innate-like T cells sharing features with both traditional adaptive and innate cells, such as the expression of an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and several NK receptors. The invariant TCR in iNKT cells interacts with CD1d, a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-like molecule. CD1d can bind and present antigens of lipid nature and induce the activation of iNKT cells, leading to the secretion of various cytokines, such as gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). These cytokines will aid in the activation of other immune cells following stimulation of iNKT cells. Several molecules with the capacity to bind to CD1d have been discovered, including &#945;-galactosylceramide. Likewise, several molecules have been synthesized that are capable of polarizing iNKT cells into different profiles, either pro- or anti-inflammatory. This versatility allows NKT cells to either aid or impair the clearance of pathogens or to even control or increase the symptoms associated with pathogenic infections. Such diverse contributions of NKT cells to infectious diseases are supported by several publications showing either a beneficial or detrimental role of these cells during diseases. In this article, we discuss current data relative to iNKT cells and their features, with an emphasis on their driving role in diseases produced by pathogenic agents in an organ-oriented fashion.","Gálvez, Nicolás M S; Bohmwald, Karen; Pacheco, Gaspar A; Andrade, Catalina A; Carreño, Leandro J; Kalergis, Alexis M",Clin. microbiol. rev,256,25

Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients' clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). METHODS: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for diseases of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who underwent an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included 6 weeks of German lockdown (16 March-26 April 2020) as well as 6 weeks before (03 February-15 March 2020) and after (27 April-07 June 2020). These periods were compared to the respective one in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to that in 2018 and 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple (ICD-10: K35.30, K35.8) and non-acute appendicitis (ICD-10: K36-K38, R10). Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. CONCLUSION: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.","Maneck, Matthias; Günster, Christian; Meyer, Hans-Joachim; Heidecke, Claus-Dieter; Rolle, Udo",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,256,16

This raises concerns about the practice of nursing management and the use of codes of professional and managerial conduct. Some responses to such failures seem to assume that codes of conduct will ensure or at least increase the likelihood that ethical management will be practised. Codes of conduct are general principles and rules of normative standards, including ethical standards, and guides for action of agents in particular roles. Nurse managers seem to stride two roles. Contra some accounts of the roles of a professional (nurse) and that of a manager, it is claimed that there is no intrinsic incompatibility of the roles though there is always the possibility that it could become so and likewise for codes of conduct. Codes of conduct can be used to support nurse managers in making practical decisions via an 'outside in' approach with an emphasis on the use of principles and an 'inside out' approach with an emphasis on the agent's character. It is claimed that both approaches are necessary, especially as guides to ethical action. However, neither is sufficient for action because judgement and choice will always be required (principles always underdetermine action) as will a conducive environment that positively influences good judgement by being supportive of the basic principles and values of healthcare institutions. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has created a unique set of circumstances in which the practical judgement, including ethical judgement, of nurse managers at all levels is being tested. However, the pandemic could be a turning point because staff and institutions (temporarily) freed from managerialism have demonstrated excellent practice supportive of ethical and other practical decision making. Organisations need to learn from this post pandemic.","Newham, Roger; Hewison, Alistair",Nurs Ethics,256,16

Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like. In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.

This emergency situation led to a sudden and compulsory shift from the office to home, forcing the adoption of teleworking from home by people and organizations who had little or no experience with this type of workstyle modality. Also, important phases such as planning and resourcing workers and managers may have been passed over with minimal or no attention. This paper aims to raise and discuss experiences on the adoption of remote work during COVID-19 and issues that should be addressed to avoid possible negative outcomes. Experiences in the adoption of telework during the pandemic show consequences already discussed by the literature, like work-family conflict, but under specific circumstances, such as the closure of schools and daycare centers. Excess workload and technology invasion are also reported as difficulties of remote work in this scenario. Using a macroergonomic model, we address issues that should be verified to overcome these challenges, at different levels, considering factors related to the organizational, personnel, and technological subsystems, and the external environment. The use of a macroergonomic model intends to consider aspects from diverse areas that could influence individual, group, or organizational desired outcomes.

In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.","Georgiou, Neophytos; Delfabbro, Paul; Balzan, Ryan",Pers.

PURPOSE: To investigate COVID-19 patients' risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. DISCUSSION: Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.","Zhong, Yaping; Liu, Weihua; Lee, Tsorng-Yeh; Zhao, Huan; Ji, Ji",Nurs. outlook,256,20

Admission Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) and Lung Ultrasound (LUS) can be of great help in clinical decision making, especially during the current pandemic and the consequent overcrowding of the Emergency Department (ED). The aim of the study was to demonstrate the capability of alveolar-to-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2) in predicting the need for subsequent oxygen support and survival in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in the presence of baseline normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) values. Methods: A cohort of 223 swab-confirmed COVID-19 patients underwent clinical evaluation, blood tests, ABG and LUS in the ED. LUS score was derived from 12 ultrasound lung windows. AaDO2 was derived as AaDO2 = ((FiO2) (Atmospheric pressure − H2O pressure) − (PaCO2/R)) − PaO2. Endpoints were subsequent oxygen support need and survival. Results: A close relationship between AaDO2 and P/F and between AaDO2 and LUS score was observed (R2 = 0.88 and R2 = 0.67, respectively;p &lt;0.001 for both). In the subgroup of patients with P/F between 300 and 400, 94.7% (n = 107) had high AaDO2 values, and 51.4% (n = 55) received oxygen support, with 2 ICU admissions and 10 deaths. According to ROC analysis, AaDO2 &gt;39.4 had 83.6% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity (AUC 0.936;p &lt;0.001) in predicting subsequent oxygen support, whereas a LUS score &gt;6 showed 89.7% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity (AUC 0.896;p &lt;0.001). Kaplan–Meier curves showed different mortality in the AaDO2 subgroups (p = 0.0025). Conclusions: LUS and AaDO2 are easy and effective tools, which allow bedside risk stratification in patients with COVID-19, especially when P/F values, signs, and symptoms are not indicative of severe lung dysfunction.","Secco, Gianmarco Salinaro Francesco Bellazzi Carlo La Salvia Marco Delorenzo Marzia Zattera Caterina Barcella Bruno Resta Flavia Vezzoni Giulia Bonzano Marco Cappa Giovanni Bruno Raffaele Casagranda Ivo Perlini Stefano",Diagnostics,256,16

By using these matrices and proper estimates for the parameters in the model, we were able to ascertain the impact of mitigation strategies employed in the past. Results show that the March 2020 lockdown had an impact on disease transmission, bringing the effective reproduction number (R(t)) below 1. We estimate that there was an increase in the transmission after the initial lift of the measures on 6 May 2020 that resulted in a second wave that was curbed by the October and November measures. December 2020 saw an increase in the transmission reaching an R(t) = 1.45 in early January 2021. Simulations indicate that the lockdown imposed on the 15 January 2021 might reduce the intensive care unit (ICU) demand to below 200 cases in early April if it lasts at least 2 months.

characteristics and serum levels of myoglobin and troponin in severe/critical COVID-19 patients Methods: We enrolled 499 consecutive eligible hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19 from February 14 to March 24, 2020 at Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between the patients who died and survived We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves of myoglobin and troponin Then, the patients were divided into myo+ group, myo- group, tro+ group, and tro- group, and survival curves were analyzed The prognostic predictable values of myoglobin and troponin were further analyzed using Cox multifactorial analysis Results: Myoglobin and troponin were significantly elevated in the death group (134 4 [Interquartile range (IQR) 24 80, 605] vs 38 02 [IQR 3 87, 11 73] ng/ml, p&lt;0 001), and troponin was also significantly elevated in the death group (0 01 [IQR 0 01, 0 01] vs 0 04 [IQR 0 02, 0 15]

AREAS COVERED: Authors review evidence on IL-6 and IL-6 blockade in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the pathophysiological and prognostic roles of this cytokine and the clinical impact of pharmacological blockade of IL-6 . The material includes original articles and reviews published from March 2020 to March 2021 and searched on PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. EXPERT OPINION: IL-6 is one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased levels are recorded in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe-to-critical disease. Evidence is accumulating on the relevance of IL-6 as a prognostic marker in COVID-19. Since IL-6 is a druggable target for several inflammatory diseases, pharmacological blockers of the IL-6 signaling pathway were repurposed to blunt the abnormal SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine release. Data are limited to few randomized controlled trials that reported encouraging, though not conclusive, results, indicating the usefulness of IL-6 blockade early in the course of the disease in patients with hyperinflammation and no or limited organ damage. Further research is warranted to explore the role of IL-6 in different COVID-19 phenotypes and identify subgroups of patients who may mostly benefit from IL-6 pathway inhibition.","Potere, Nicola; Batticciotto, Alberto; Vecchié, Alessandra; Porreca, Ettore; Cappelli, Antonella; Abbate, Antonio; Dentali, Francesco; Bonaventura, Aldo",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,256,33

There is little evidence in the literature assessing its effect on patients with Covid-19. With this in mind, we performed a retrospective study of patients receiving treatment with prone-position in the context of Covid-19, and have assessed its impact on efficiency of ventilation (dead space ratio), oxygenation (P/F ratio) and mortality. METHODS We included all patients admitted to our 18 bed ICU with either PCR-confirmed or clinically presumed diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia, who were under mechanical ventilation and completed two or more full proning cycles in the period 03/12/2020-04/12/2020. Demographic characteristics, data on mechanical ventilation, patient position, end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gas were obtained from patient charts. Pa/FiO2 ratios (P/F) were calculated as a marker of oxygenation and dead space fraction (Vd/Vt) to assess ventilation. RESULTS Twelve patients were studied. There was a statistically significant improvement in P/F ratio when prone compared to supine (Wilcoxon signed-rank Z=12, p&lt;0.01) with more than a 20% increase. There was no statistically significant change in Vd/Vt ratio on proning (p&gt;0.05). Over time, Vd/Vt increased in non-survivors (Rs=0.48, p&lt;0.01), whilst remained flat in survivors (Rs=0.002, p=0.97). See Figure 1. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that prone position in patients with Covid-19 has little effect on dead space fraction, but does improve oxygenation. This poses the question as to whether this therapy adds anything to the management of Covid-19 patients-aside from a transient improvement in oxygenation that would buy time for additional therapies to succeed. In non-survivors, we observed a progressive rise in Vd/Vt over time. This was not the case in survivors, as seen in ARDS, where a rise in Vd/Vt has been shown to be a prognostic marker for death. With regards to response to prone position, only improvements in Vd/Vt (but not in P/F ratio) have been shown to be prognostic. Our findings seem to replicate this in Covid-19 patients. We propose the regular calculation of Vd/Vt as an easy tool to assess the progress of Covid-19 patients. Our sample size was small and contained mainly our sickest Covid-19 patients due a high number of inter-trust bed pressure transfers. Drawing firm conclusions from this data is thus not possible however we believe it to still be valuable. Further work is required to show a replication of our findings on a larger scale.

In contrast, comparatively few studies exists on the role of online activists, defined informally as users who actively participate in socially-minded online campaigns. Automatically discovering activists who can potentially be approached by organisations that promote social campaigns is important, but not easy, as they are typically active only locally, and, unlike influencers, they are not central to large social media networks. We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found on Twitter within temporally and spatially localised contexts. We define these as small but topical fragments of the network, containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant online footprint. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed an iterative discovery pipeline consisting of two alternating phases of user discovery and context discovery. Multiple iterations of the pipeline result in a growing dataset of user profiles for activists, as well as growing set of online social contexts. This mode of exploration differs significantly from prior techniques that focus on influencers, and presents unique challenges because of the weak online signal available to detect activists.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates. Exposures: Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results: A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2%), 38 (3.3%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5%) died, and 831 (72.2%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).

This study describes a novel strategy for preventing and controlling COVID-19 infection in the third-tier city of Liaocheng, China. The prevention and control measurements included city-wide orders to close workspaces, sanitize essential workspaces, quarantine individuals with a travel history to an epidemic area, and issue emergency medical responses to quarantine and treat COVID-19 patients using all necessary technologies, personnel, and resources. As a result, there were only 38 diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Liaocheng since the pandemic began in China in late 2019, including in the metropolitan area and six suburban counties, accounting for more than 6.39 millions residents living in a 8,715 km2 area.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection affecting several systems including the haematopoietic system. Surveys illustrating the laboratory findings of these patients conclude that lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia are prominent amongst them. Moreover, it has been reported a significant decrease in T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Generally, thrombocytopenia is commonplace in critically ill patients and usually suggests serious organ malfunction. In view of this, this review investigates the correlation between these abnormalities and the prognosis and disease course. Full blood count is an easy, economic and widely available tool which may help to discriminate between patients with or without severe disease. Last but not least, this review examines potential pathophysiological mechanisms by the novel coronavirus which contribute to these haematological alterations aiding the clinicians to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options.","Violetis, Odyssefs A; Chasouraki, Angeliki M; Giannou, Alexandra M; Baraboutis, Ioannis G",SN Compr Clin Med,256,16

A bispecific IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) has been developed on the basis of C121 and C135, two antibodies derived from donors who had recovered from COVID-193. Here we show that CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable spike binding to the cellular receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonal antibodies. We also found that in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, the simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, and combines the advantages of antibody cocktails with those of single-molecule approaches.","De Gasparo, Raoul; Pedotti, Mattia; Simonelli, Luca; Nickl, Petr; Muecksch, Frauke; Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Mazzola, Federica; Magrì, Davide; Michalcikova, Tereza; Haviernik, Jan; Honig, Vaclav; Mrazkova, Blanka; Polakova, Natalie; Fortova, Andrea; Tureckova, Jolana; Iatsiuk, Veronika; Di Girolamo, Salvatore; Palus, Martin; Zudova, Dagmar; Bednar, Petr; Bukova, Ivana; Bianchini, Filippo; Mehn, Dora; Nencka, Radim; Strakova, Petra; Pavlis, Oto; Rozman, Jan; Gioria, Sabrina; Sammartino, Josè Camilla; Giardina, Federica; Gaiarsa, Stefano; Pan-Hammarström, Qiang; Barnes, Christopher O; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Calzolai, Luigi; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Bieniasz, Paul D; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Prochazka, Jan; Sedlacek, Radislav; Robbiani, Davide F; Ruzek, Daniel; Varani, Luca",Nature,256,16

METHODS: Stratified treatment decisions in a cross-location telemedical interdisciplinary case conference were assessed in this retrospective cohort study. A standardized treatment algorithm including continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation was implemented. A locally developed COVID inflammation score (CIS) defined patients at risk for severe disease. Patients with life-threatening inflammation were offered off-label treatment with the immune modulator ruxolitinib. RESULTS: Between 4 March 2020 and 26 June 2020 COVID-19 patients (nâ¯= 196) were treated. Median patient age (70 years) and comorbidity were high in interstudy comparison. Mortality in all patients was 17.3%. However, advance care planning statements and physician directives limited treatment intensity in 50% of the deceased patients. CIS monitoring of ruxolitinib-treated high-risk patients (nâ¯= 20) on days 5, 7, and15 resulted in suppression of inflammation by 42% (15-70), 54% (15-77) and 60% (15-80). Here, mortality was 20% (4/20). Adjusted for patients with a maximum care directive including ICU, total mortality was 8.7% (17/196). CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia with hyperferritinemic inflammation is related to macrophage activation syndrome-like sepsis. An interdisciplinary intensive care teleconference as a quality tool for ICUs is proposed to detect patients with rare sepsis-like syndromes.","La Rosée, P; Bremer, H-C; La Rosée, F; Mohm, P; Hochhaus, A; Gehrke, I; Kumle, B; Benzing, A; Russo, S",Med.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 981 patients from a multi-institutional international cohort with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT of the patients. The data of the cohort were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets using a 7:1:2 ratio. A ML pipeline consisting of a model to predict severity and time-to-event model to predict progression to critical illness were trained on radiomics features and clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent ROC-AUC were calculated to determine model performance, which was compared with consensus CT severity scores obtained by visual interpretation by radiologists. RESULTS: Among 981 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 274 patients developed critical illness. Radiomics features and clinical variables resulted in the best performance for the prediction of disease severity with a highest test ROC-AUC of 0.76 compared with 0.70 (0.76 vs. 0.70, p = 0.023) for visual CT severity score and clinical variables. The progression prediction model achieved a test C-index of 0.868 when it was based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables compared with 0.767 when based on CT radiomics features alone (p < 0.001), 0.847 when based on clinical variables alone (p = 0.110), and 0.860 when based on the combination of visual CT severity scores and clinical variables (p = 0.549). Furthermore, the model based on the combination of CT radiomics and clinical variables achieved time-dependent ROC-AUCs of 0.897, 0.933, and 0.927 for the prediction of progression risks at 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively.

Pediatric providers have reported a high number of patients without comorbidities presenting with hemorrhagic strokes associated with COVID-19. We present a study analyzing the factors associated with mortality in this setting. METHODS: Prospective case-control study that included patients <17 years old admitted to a pediatric critical care unit with a positive test confirming COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality. Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were admitted to critical care. The mortality of our study is 21.3%. The mortality of patients with neurological presentation was 45.5%, which was significantly higher than the mortality of acute COVID-19 (26.7%) and MIS-C (4.8%), p 0.18. Other risk factors for mortality in our cohort were strokes and comorbidities. Only one patient presenting with hemorrhagic stroke had an undiagnosed comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular events associated with COVID-19 in pediatric patients, including infants, must be recognized as one of the more severe presentations of this infection in pediatric patients. IMPACT: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 can present with hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes on presentation. Neurological presentation in pediatric patients with COVID-19 has high mortality.

Immunological Insights,15.092657,6.8711905,2021,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed a grave threat to the global public health. The COVID-19-induced infection is closely related to coagulation dysfunction in the affected patients. This paper attempts to conduct a meta-analysis and systematically review the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed to compare the blood coagulation indicators in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between 1 December 2019 and 7 May 2020. A total of 13 studies with 1341 adult patients were enrolled in this analysis. Platelet (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -24.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -34.12 to -15.54; P < .001), d-dimer (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29; P < .001), and fibrinogen (WMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.50-1.54; P < .001) were significantly associated with the severity in patients with COVID-19. The meta-analysis revealed that no correlation was evident between an increased severity risk of COVID-19 and activated partial thromboplastin time (WMD = -1.56, 95% CI: -5.77 to 2.64; P = .468) or prothrombin time (WMD = 0.19, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.51; P = .243). The single arm meta-analysis showed that compared with the nonsevere group, the severe group had a lower pooled platelet (165.12 [95% CI: 157.38-172.85] vs 190.09 [95% CI: 179.45-200.74]), higher d-dimer (0.49 [95% CI: 0.33-0.64] vs 0.27 [95% CI: 0.20-0.34]), and higher fibrinogen (4.34 [95% CI: 1.98-6.70] vs 3.19 [95% CI: 1.13-5.24]). Coagulation dysfunction is closely related to the severity of patients with COVID-19, in which low platelet, high d-dimer, and fibrinogen upon admission may serve as risk indicators for increased aggression of the disease. These findings are of great clinical value for timely and effective treatment of the COVID-19 cases.","Lin, Jing; Yan, Han; Chen, Hanchuan; He, Chen; Lin, Chunjin; He, Haoming; Zhang, Sicheng; Shi, Songjing; Lin, Kaiyang",J. med. virol,256,16

Quarantine, defined as the separation and restriction of movement of healthy people who have potentially been exposed to the disease, remains contentious especially when the risks and benefits are not fully discussed and not effectively communicated to the people by the organizations who impose this public health measure. Subject and methods: A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to examine the phenomenon of adherence to quarantine focused on the following questions: What strategies affect adherence to quarantine? What are the barriers and facilitators to quarantine acceptance? What benefits and harms of quarantine have been described or measured? Results: The evidence synthesis produced 18 findings assessed with high confidence. The findings were used to construct a conceptual framework for inter- and within-organization coordination and public communication that includes the following topics for consideration: desired orientation for implementation; population demographics; perceptions of messages; prior acceptance of quarantine; likelihood of impacts of quarantine; perceptions of health infrastructure; and perceptions of policy importance. Conclusion: The findings and conceptual framework can guide development of effective non-pharmaceutical interventions and as such have direct relevance to public health policy and decision-making for intervening in emergent infectious diseases outbreak such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Sopory, Pradeep; Novak, Julie M; Noyes, Jane P",Z Gesundh Wiss,256,26

The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate a sensitive and controversial topic: the perspectives of healthcare staff about the presence and impacts of implicit bias in the Hungarian healthcare system towards Roma patients. Therefore, between June 2017 and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues may be beneficial. Stress and burnout of healthcare professionals also need to be addressed as these may impact on the enactment of unconscious biases.","Marek, Erika; Nemeth, Timea; Orsos, Zsuzsa",Health promot. internation,256,24

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. METHODS: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 and activates fibrosis-related genes and processes to induce lung fibrosis.","Xu, Jincheng; Xu, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Lina; Dua, Kamal; Hansbro, Philip M; Liu, Gang",Respir Res,256,3

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of ""panic shopping"" or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.","Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand",JMIR Public Health Surveill,256,20

Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental health of older people. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows a qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 Nâ¯= 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. A qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people. CONCLUSION: Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.","Welzel, Franziska D; Schladitz, Katja; Förster, Franziska; Löbner, Margrit; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G",Bundesgesundheitsblatt gesundheitsforschung gesundheitsschutz,256,22

In response to acute responses to stress, it is crucial to provide psychoeducation, mindfulness and coping resources. These interventions can improve resilience and self-efficacy of professionals, as well as help to prevent anxiety, depression and quality of sleep.

This study aims at understanding the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients with pleural effusion. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled from the Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Pharyngeal swabs from patients were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups based on their computed tomography (CT) scans for the presence of pleural effusion at admission. We compared the clinical features, laboratory findings, scans and clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Pleural effusion was observed in 9.19% of the patients. Patients with pleural effusion were more likely to be severe or critical cases. Moreover, patients with pleural effusion were associated with increased mortality. Of the 799 discharged patients, patients with pleural effusion had longer hospital stays and duration of viral shedding since the onset of symptoms as compared with that for patients without pleural effusion. After discharge, 217 patients visited for a follow-up CT re-examination at the Union Hospital. The CT scans showed that patients with pleural effusion required a longer time to resolve the lung inflammation after the onset of COVID-19 as compared with the time required by patients without pleural effusion.

All flavonoids contain a common 2-phenyl chromone structure (C6-C3-C6) as a scaffold. Hence, in using such a scaffold, plenty of high-value-added flavonoids can be synthesized by chemical or biological catalyzation approaches. (2S)-Naringenin is one of the most commonly used flavonoid scaffolds. However, biosynthesizing (2S)-naringenin has been restricted not only by the low production but also by the expensive precursors and inducers that are used. Herein, we established an induction-free system to de novo biosynthesize (2S)-naringenin in Escherichia coli. The tyrosine synthesis pathway was enhanced by overexpressing feedback inhibition resistant genes (aroGfbr and tyrAfbr) and knocking out a repressor gene (tyrR). After optimizing the fermentation medium and conditions, we found that glycerol, glucose, fatty acids, potassium acetate, temperature, and initial pH are important for producing (2S)-naringenin. Using the optimum fermentation medium and conditions, our best strain Nar-17LM1 could produce 588 mg/L (2S)-naringenin from glucose in a 5-L bioreactor, the highest titer reported to date in E. coli.","Zhou, Shenghu; Hao, Tingting; Zhou, Jingwen",,256,21

The rise of COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during the first months of strict containment, cause to temporally stop most of the ongoing programs. We studied the effects of an interdisciplinary phase II secondary prevention in patients diagnosed with a recent acute coronary syndrome with the use of new technologies, home-exercise and telemedicine. METHODS: Between the 2nd and 11th of March 2020, we included 37 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (76.4%), low-risk and preserved systolic function and underwent a 12-week treatment. A dynamic muscle toning with overload domiciliary training program was applied, in addition to nutritional counselling, as well as psychological and educational therapy. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 30 patients finished. At the end of the program, we observed and increased functional capacity over the 6-min walking test (+47.13m; 95% CI: 32.82-61.45, P<.001), and improvement to the subjective feeling of dyspnoea on the modified Borg scale (-0.5 units; 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.24, P=.001), and an improvement over both initial and final training systolic blood pressure (-6.67mmHg; 95% CI: -10.98 to -2.35, P=.004) (-7mmHg; 95% CI: -12.86 to -1.14, P=.021).

We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presenting with combined DKA/HHS to our institution. METHODS: A retrospective, hospital based observation case series was performed on patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Intensive Care Unit between 3/20/2020 and 4/20/2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) Blood Glucose >250 mg/dL; (2) Serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L; (3) Anion Gap >10; (4) serum pH <7.3; (5) ketonemia or ketonuria; (6) effective/calculated plasma osmolality >304 mOsm/kg and (7) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: We reported 6 patients who presented during this period with combined DKA/HHS. Their median age was 50 years, all males, three Hispanic, and three African American. Hispanic patients, had more severe acidosis, and multiple comorbidities, with a higher mortality. The striking feature was that combined DKA/HHS was the initial presentation for COVID-19 for most of the cases. DISCUSSION: Our observational retrospective case series shows that diabetic patients are at risk of developing combined DKA/ HHS associated with COVID-19 and a substantial mortality. To our knowledge, we are first to report the clinical characteristics and outcome in this group of patients.","Chan, Kok Hoe; Thimmareddygari, Divya; Ramahi, Amr; Atallah, Liana; Baranetsky, Nicholas G; Slim, Jihad",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,256,1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys using a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited via snowball techniques. SETTING: São Paulo state, the urban epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil at the time of the study. PARTICIPANTS: 2.203 clicks to the survey link and 1.223 surveys completed (55.5% response rate). However, only 1118 surveys were considered after the exclusion criteria (>18 years-old and consent). MEASURES: Demographics, educational status, COVID-19-related symptoms (headache, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, asthenia, diarrhea, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, anosmia, and ageusia), and face mask use. ANALYSIS: Self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms were categorized as dichotomous variables (Cohen's h = 0.94). Pearson Chi-square test evaluated differences between T1 and T2 and logistic multiple regression analyzed odds-ratio for the presence of symptoms and independent variables. RESULTS: Face mask use increased from 43.60% in T1 to 90.52% in T2 (P < .0001) as the pandemic went on. Health literacy also changed within 2 weeks and people started to assume everybody should use face masks (62.93% in T1 vs 94.12% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.29) during outside activities (43.60% in T1 vs 90.52% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.39). Self-reports of face mask use were associated with fewer self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 0.65, P = .01, 95% CI 0.48; 0.88). CONCLUSION: Face mask use was already high among educated Brazilians before the formal recommendation by the authorities. This may have contributed to fewer self-reports of COVID-19-related symptoms.","Fernandes, Danilo Euclides; Riguetti, Michelle T P; Mastroianni Kirsztajn, Gianna",Am J Health Promot,256,26

Design: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to compare doses of sedatives between ICU patients receiving standard IV sedation and patients receiving mixed sedation including inhaled isoflurane. Data were obtained from electronic medical records. Setting: ICU at large academic medical center where mechanical ventilation was delivered with Draeger Apollo (Draeger Medical, Telford, PA) anesthesia machines. Patients: Consecutive adult patients (&#8805; 18 yr) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU between April 2, 2020, and May 4, 2020. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-five mechanically ventilated patients were included in the study, with a mean (sd) age of 59.4 (12.8) years. Twenty-three patients (65.7%) were men. Seventeen patients (48.6%) received standard IV sedation, whereas 18 (51.4%) also received isoflurane. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation (sd) was 23.3 (11.6) days in the standard sedation group and 23.8 (12.5) days in the isoflurane group. Mean (sd) duration of isoflurane exposure was 5.61 (2.99) days, representing 29.1% of total sedation time (sd, 20.4). Cumulative opioid exposure did not differ between the standard sedation and isoflurane sedation groups (mean morphine milligram equivalent 6668 [sd, 1,346] vs 6678 [sd, 2,000] mg). However, the initiation of isoflurane in patients was associated with decreased utilization of propofol (mean daily amount 3,656 [sd, 1,635] before vs 950 [sd, 1,804] mg during isoflurane) and hydromorphone (mean daily amount 48 [sd, 30] before vs 23 [sd, 27] mg). Conclusions: In the subjects that received isoflurane, its use was associated with significant decreases in propofol and hydromorphone infusions.","Hanidziar, Dusan; Baldyga, Kathryn; Ji, Christine S; Lu, Jing; Zheng, Hui; Wiener-Kronish, Jeanine; Xie, Zhongcong",Crit Care Explor,256,16

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific immunoglobulin E tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 61 (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalences of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and episodic wheezing were 10.3%, 6,5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. Although having asthma with or without allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization because of COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to decrease the risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.191; 95% confidence interval, 0.047-0.779; P = .02). Spirometry tests revealed a higher forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio and a peak expiratory flow reversibility in hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized ones (P = .02 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthma and allergic diseases do not seem to be risk factors for hospitalization in children because of COVID-19, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect. Pulmonary function testing seems to be important for monitoring lung damage after COVID-19.","Beken, Burcin; Ozturk, Gokcen Kartal; Aygun, Fatma Deniz; Aydogmus, Cigdem; Akar, Himmet Haluk",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,256,6

We compiled an inventory of 32 questions to evaluate the impact of the SARS-COV2 epidemic on maxillofacial surgery in 23 selected Italian maxillofacial departments. The questionnaire focused on three different aspects: the variation of the workload, showing both a reduction of the number of team members (-16% among specialists, -11% among residents) due to reallocation or contamination and a consistent reduction of elective activities (the number of outpatient visits cancelled during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic was about 10 000 all over Italy), while only tumour surgery and trauma surgery has been widely guaranteed; the screening procedures on patients and physicians (22% of maxillofacial units found infected surgeons, which is 4% of all maxillofacial surgeons); and the availability of Personal Protective Equipment, is only considered to be partial in 48% of Maxillofacial departments. This emergency has forced those of us in the Italian health system to change the way we work, but only time will prove if these changes have been effective.","Allevi, F; Dionisio, A; Baciliero, U; Balercia, P; Beltramini, G A; Bertossi, D; Bozzetti, A; Califano, L; Cascone, P; Colombo, L; Copelli, C; De Ponte, F S; De Riu, G; Della Monaca, M; Fusetti, S; Galié, M; Giannì, A B; Longo, F; Mannucci, N; Nocini, P F; Pelo, S; Ramieri, G; Sesenna, E; Solazzo, L; Spinelli, G; Tarsitano, A; Tartaro, G; Valentini, V; Verrina, G; Biglioli, F",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,256,29

The new algorithms are particularly efficient for latent state inference in high-dimensional state space models, where blocking in both space and time is necessary to avoid degeneracy of MCMC. The efficiency of our blocked bouncy particle sampler, in comparison with both the standard implementation of the bouncy particle sampler and the particle Gibbs algorithm of Andrieu et al.

The virus first appeared in early December 2019 in China, and on 1 March, the first positive person in the Czech Republic was confirmed. The Ministry of Health and subsequently the Government of the Czech Republic took relatively strict epidemiological measures in connection with the development of the epidemic in China, subsequently in individual countries of the European Union and in other countries throughout the world. In order to effectively implement epidemiological measures, the Government declared a state of emergency for the Czech Republic due to health threats in connection with the proof of occurrence of coronavirus SARS CoV-2 from 14.00 on 12 March 2020 for 30 days. The state of emergency was then extended until 17 May 2020. The aim of the article is to investigate the emerging solutions and impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on selected spheres of society in the Czech Republic in the period from March to April 2020, focusing on specific procedures in the South Bohemian Region. As part of the epidemiological measures, it was necessary to address the situation of socially disadvantaged groups, such as the homeless or those ordered out due to domestic violence. The case study examined the provision of care for homeless people and those ordered out due to domestic violence who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were not hospitalised or quarantined. In practice, crisis management tools in conjunction with epidemiological approaches have proven to be effective and usable. The examples show that, despite the complexity of the situation, regional and local governments have found a way to implement the necessary measures to mitigate the impact on local society and the community.","Kavan, Stepan",Heal. soc. care community,256,16

METHODS: Thirty-two intensive care unit survivors were prospectively evaluated from February 2017 to August 2018 in a post-intensive care unit outpatient clinic in Brazil. Individuals with intensive care unit stays > 72 hours (emergency admissions) or > 120 hours (elective admissions) attending the post-intensive care unit clinic four months after intensive care unit discharge were consecutively enrolled. The association between the 6-Minute Walk Test distance at baseline and physical functional status was assessed over 8 months using the Barthel Index. RESULTS: The mean 6-Minute Walk Test distance was significantly lower in intensive care unit survivors than in the general population (405m versus 557m; p < 0.001). Age (ß = -4.0; p < 0.001) and muscle weakness (ß = -99.7; p = 0.02) were associated with the 6-Minute Walk Test distance. A 6-Minute Walk Test distance was associated with improvement in physical functional status over the 8-month follow-up (odds ratio for each 10m of 1.07; 95%CI 1.01 - 1.16; p = 0.03). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for the 6-Minute Walk Test prediction of physical functional status improvement was 0.72 (95%CI 0.53 - 0.88).

However, most of the published studies are small case series, and only two randomized trials exist in literature. AIM: Aim of this systematic review is to describe trends in VV ECMO treatment outcomes according to large studies only. METHODS: We searched and included studies with more than 100 VV ECMO cases dated up to August 1st, 2019. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies published in the period 2011-2019 met inclusion criteria, for a total of 12,860 patients (age 46.3 ± 17.4 years). ARDS was mainly by pneumonia, in 3126 (37%) cases; further 401(7%) patients had H1N1 Influenza A infection. Cannulation-related complications occurred in 502 (7%) cases. Weighted mean (95% confidence interval) of VV ECMO duration was 8.9 (8.7-9.1) days, and ICU stay was 23.6 (22.4-24.8) days. Mortality at the longest follow up available was 40%. Data collection in 70% of the studies had a duration of >5 years.

We present a tractable model that allows us to study the interaction among the diffusion of an epidemic, vaccination choices, and the dynamics of cultural traits. We apply it to study the impact of homophily between pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxers on the total number of cases (the cumulative infection). We show that, during the outbreak of a disease, homophily has the direct effect of decreasing the speed of recovery. Hence, it may increase the number of cases and make the disease endemic. The dynamics of the shares of the two cultural traits in the population is crucial in determining the sign of the total effect on the cumulative infection: more homophily is beneficial if agents are not too flexible in changing their cultural trait, is detrimental otherwise.","Bizzarri, Matteo; Panebianco, Fabrizio; Pin, Paolo",,256,22

One of these alternatives is the QuEChERS, originally developed for the analysis of pesticide residues, producing cleaner extracts than liquid-liquid extraction, and easier separation of aqueous and organic phases. However, there are few published studies on the miniaturization of this technique for forensic toxicology, especially in postmortem analysis. We developed and validated a modified micro-QuEChERS and LC-MS-MS assay to quantify 16 antidepressants, seven antipsychotics and three metabolites, and semi-quantify norfluoxetine and norsertraline in postmortem blood. The calibration curve was linear from 1-500 ng/mL, achieved a r>0.99, with all standards quantifying within ±15% of target except ±20% at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ng/mL for 26 substances.

Cancer patients have a higher risk of being infected by SARS-Cov-2 and higher coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. Up to date, there were no data about COVID-19 in patients with thyroid cancer (TCs). The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 in a well-characterized series of TC patients evaluated for the persistence of the neoplastic disease from March to September 2020; as secondary objective, we looked for the COVID-19 disease severity in a subgroup of multimetastatic TC patients. METHODS: We evaluated 1464 patients affected by persistent TC: 67 patients who were taking multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and 1397 under active surveillance for a persistent but stable disease. During the clinical evaluation, all patients were specifically investigated about a positive history of Sars-Cov-2 infection. RESULTS: SARS-Cov-2 infection was identified in 4/1464 (0.3%) cases of patients affected by TC. We identified three cases among patients under active surveillance (0.2%), and one case among patients treated with MKI systemic therapy (1/67, 1.5%). This patient was taking vandetanib for metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), when he came to our attention referring severe fatigue, dyspnea for light physical activities. He presented a mild COVID-19 and he received exclusively supportive care. After a multidisciplinary consultation, we decided against the discontinuation of vandetanib. After 2 months from the infection, he did not present any signs of active infection, and the MTC metastatic disease was stable. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that COVID-19 is not more frequent in TC patients than in general population, although a relatively higher prevalence in the group of TC patients treated with MKIs. A single patient with advanced TC and SARS-Cov-2 infection during MKIs treatment had a mild COVID-19 and did not require the discontinuation of MKI therapy. In cases of more severe COVID-19, an accurate evaluation from a multidisciplinary team would consider risks and benefits in taking the decision to continue or stop MKI treatment.","Prete, Alessandro; Falcone, Marco; Bottici, Valeria; Giani, Carlotta; Tiseo, Giusy; Agate, Laura; Matrone, Antonio; Cappagli, Virginia; Valerio, Laura; Lorusso, Loredana; Minaldi, Elisa; Molinaro, Eleonora; Elisei, Rossella",Endocrine,256,33

The organization of ideological discourse represents strategic, discursive acts committed by populist leaders aimed at foregrounding social conditions that would function in the advancement of various political ends—whether those ends may be the consolidation of power, the undermining of institutional systems of checks and balances, the implementation of exclusionary or injurious policies against disenfranchised constituents, the suspension of civil liberties, or a combination thereof. It is engendered through a three-stage process. In the first stage, surface-level validation by legitimate institutional actors confirms preconceived ideas about a constructed enemy. In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy.

The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with &#916;ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Subudhi, Sonu; Rapin, Noreen; Lew, Jocelyne; Jain, Richa; Falzarano, Darryl; Misra, Vikram",Sci Rep,256,20

In our institute, a tertiary oncologic public hospital with high surgical volume, we prioritize maintaining cancer treatment as well as possible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if uro-oncological surgeries at pandemic are safe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent uro-oncological procedures. Epidemiological data, information on COVID-19 infection related to surgery and clinical characteristics of non-survival operative patients with COVID-19 infections were analyzed. RESULTS: From 213 patients analyzed, Covid-19 symptoms were noticed in 8 patients at preoperative process or at hospital admission postponing operation; 161 patients were submitted to elective surgery and 44 to emergency surgery. From patients submitted to elective surgeries, we had 1 patient with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (0,6%), with mild symptoms and quick discharge. From the urgencies group, we had 6(13%)patients tested positive; 5 were taken to ICU with 4 deaths. CONCLUSION: Elective uro-oncological procedures at the COVID-19 epidemic period in a COVID-19-free Institute are safe, and patients who need urgent procedures, with a long period of hospitalization, need special care to avoid COVID-19 infection and its outcomes.","Silva, Gabriel Carvalho Dos Anjos; Abe, Daniel Kanda; Pedrenho, Rubens; Vilares, Rafael Nascimento; Cordeiro, Mauricio Dener; Coelho, Rafael Ferreira; Nahas, William Carlos",Int Braz J Urol,256,32

Questions related to infection rates and mechanisms, the possibility of reinfection, and potential therapeutic approaches require us not only to use the experimental models previously employed for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses but also to generate new models to respond to urgent questions. Development: We reviewed the different experimental models used in the study of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 both in different cell lines that have enabled identification of the virus' action mechanisms and in animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and primates) inoculated with the virus. Specifically, we reviewed models used to assess the presence and effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS, including neural cell lines, animal models such as mouse hepatitis virus CoV (especially the 59 strain), and the use of brain organoids. Conclusion: Given the clear need to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its potential effects on the CNS, we must endeavor to obtain new information with cellular or animal models, with an appropriate resemblance between models and human patients.","Sanclemente-Alaman, Inmaculada; Moreno-Jiménez, Lidia; Benito-Martín, María Soledad; Canales-Aguirre, Alejandro; Matías-Guiu, Jordi A; Matías-Guiu, Jorge; Gómez-Pinedo, Ulises",Front Immunol,256,1

Further research on new species could be highly informative in regard to the influence that adaptation to different ecological challenges has on felid personality. We evaluated the personality of 58 Iberian lynxes (Lynx pardinus) hosted at 3 different breeding centers for reintroduction. A total of 43 adjectives obtained from previous studies with felids were assessed by 30 raters according to the knowledge on the lynx behavior they acquired by observing a live video feed of the animals, finding acceptable standards of interrater reliability. Principal components analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis revealed 4 factors. Based on the pattern of factor loadings and on previous labeling in felid personality research, we labeled the factors as Boldness, Dominance, Neuroticism, and Attentiveness. The results were similar to that of the previous studies on felids, although some differences were found, which could be due to the evolutionary distance among species and to methodological differences among studies. Future research on endangered felids could provide insights into the influence of personality on conservation outcomes related to successful breeding and reintroduction.

Development of effective vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be aided by a molecular-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their interactions with host cell proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly homologous to the N protein of SARS-CoV, which is essential for viral RNA replication and packaging into new virions. Emerging models indicate that nucleocapsid proteins of other viruses can form biomolecular condensates to spatiotemporally regulate N protein localization and function. Our bioinformatic analyses, in combination with pre-existing experimental evidence, suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of forming or regulating biomolecular condensates in vivo by interaction with RNA and key host cell proteins. We discuss multiple models, whereby the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may harness this activity to regulate viral life cycle and host cell response to viral infection.","Cascarina, Sean M; Ross, Eric D",FASEB J,256,24

The genetic cause for about half of the individuals affected by HMN/CMT2 remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) in four unrelated families with individuals affected by sporadic or dominant HMN/CMT2. Genomic sequencing analyses in seven affected individuals uncovered four distinct heterozygous GBF1 variants, two of which occurred de novo. Other known HMN/CMT2-implicated genes were excluded. Affected individuals show HMN/CMT2 with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and musculoskeletal deformities. Electrophysiological studies confirmed axonal damage with chronic neurogenic changes. Three individuals had additional distal sensory loss. GBF1 encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that facilitates the activation of members of the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) family of small GTPases. GBF1 is mainly involved in the formation of coatomer protein complex (COPI) vesicles, maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria migration and positioning. We demonstrate that GBF1 is present in mouse spinal cord and muscle tissues and is particularly abundant in neuropathologically relevant sites, such as the motor neuron and the growth cone. Consistent with the described role of GBF1 in Golgi function and maintenance, we observed marked increase in Golgi fragmentation in primary fibroblasts derived from all affected individuals in this study.

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.

The second objective is to scrutinize Parker’s idiosyncratic use of the methodology of auto-ethnography Here it is argued, again, that Parker’s appropriation of this method not only is ideally positioned to question the problematic field of mainstream psychology, but also opens up a different perspective on subjectivity and sociality that should challenge Critical Psychology The third objective is to apply these insights to the Covid crisis: if Parker enjoins us to step outside the psy-complex and “find many other ways to live together without it,” the entry of mainstream psychology into the Covid-debate, claiming expert knowledge on how we should live apart/together, should be confronted head-on To achieve these three objectives, the author also uses a moderate dose of auto-ethnography [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Qualitative Research in Psychology is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","De Vos, Jan",Qualitative Research in Psychology,256,2

In this report, a chemical approach is presented to partially replace Mn2+ of the NVMP framework by Mg2+ and Al3+ substitutions. The Mg- and Al-substituted NVMP cathodes present smoother voltage profiles, facile sodium (de)intercalation, enhanced rate performances (80 mA h g-1 at 5C rate) and capacity retention (&#8776;96% after 100 cycles) in comparison with the unsubstituted sample.

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-varying case reproduction number R e ( t ) based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/). Code and synthetic data for the analysis are available from https://github.com/FelixGuenther/nc_covid19_bavaria and can be used for adaption of our approach to different data.","Günther, Felix; Bender, Andreas; Katz, Katharina; Küchenhoff, Helmut; Höhle, Michael",Biom. j,256,10

The method allows highly specific and sensitive visualization of viral RNA by relying on HCR initiated by probe localization. Split-initiator probes help amplify the signal by fluorescently labeled amplifiers, resulting in negligible background fluorescence in confocal microscopy. Labeling amplifiers with different fluorescent dyes facilitates the simultaneous recognition of various targets. This, in turn, allows the mapping of the infection in tissues to better understand viral pathogenesis and replication at the single-cell level. Coupling this method with immunofluorescence may facilitate better understanding of host-virus interactions, including alternation of the host epigenome and immune response pathways. Owing to sensitive and specific HCR technology, this protocol can also be used as a diagnostic tool. It is also important to remember that the technique may be modified easily to enable detection of any RNA, including non-coding RNAs and RNA viruses that may emerge in the future.","Kula-Pacurar, Anna; Wadas, Jakub; Suder, Agnieszka; Szczepanski, Artur; Milewska, Aleksandra; Ochman, Marek; Stacel, Tomasz; Pyrc, Krzysztof",J. vis. exp,256,16

(Special Issue: Pandemic COVID19.),15.2601,6.9358525,2020,"Zipfs Law states that rank-size distributions of city populations follow a power law with an exponent of -1. The assertion of a universal power law is controversial because the linearity and slope appear to vary over time and among countries. We compare census enumerations and night light luminance as proxies for population density and intensity of development in the contiguous United States. Treating population density and development intensity as continuous quantities allows for the definition of spatial networks based on the level of spatial connectivity. The resulting distributions of spatial network components (subsets of connected nodes) vary with degree of connectivity, but maintain consistent scaling over a wide range of network sizes. At continental scales, spatial network rank-size distributions obtained from both population density and night light brightness are well-fit by power laws with exponents near -1 for a wide range of density and luminance thresholds. However, the largest components (10,000 - 100,000 sq.km) are far larger than individual cities and represent spatially contiguous agglomerations of urban, suburban and periurban development. Projecting county-level numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for the US onto spatial networks of population and development allows the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic to be quantified as propagation within networks of varying connectivity.. The results show an abrupt transition from slow increases in confirmed cases in a small number of network components to rapid geographic dispersion to a larger number of components before mobility reductions occurred in March 2020.","Small, Christopher; MacDonald, Andrew J.; Sousa, Daniel",,256,16

There is hardly any evidence regarding such rapid transitions to online teaching, especially from resource-poor settings. We share our experience of developing an online teaching program based on teachers' and students' feedback. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown period in a public-funded medical institute of India. Online feedback was obtained 3 weeks after the beginning of emergency remote teaching. The responses by the students and teachers shaped the final online teaching program which reinforced the perceived strengths and addressed the weaknesses. Observations were made for the proportion of scheduled lectures delivered through digital platform and students' attendance in the 1st week and last week of the study period. RESULTS: Feedback was obtained from 367 students and 56 teachers. Around three-fourths of the students (76.7%) and teachers (73.2%) were satisfied with online teaching. The themes generated for benefits of online teaching were similar for both students and teachers, but the perceived challenges differed. Students found online teaching more stressful, and teachers were apprehensive of the new technology and lack of a controlled environment. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid transition to development and implementation of an online teaching program was found to be feasible and acceptable to the primary stakeholders.

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary widely and the spectrum of clinical presentation has yet to be fully characterised (2). Many countries have detailed their early experience with COVID-19, with a focus on the clinical characteristics of the disease. However, to our knowledge, there has been no such study detailing symptoms in the Irish population. AIM: Our aim is to describe COVID-19 symptoms in the Irish population at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare symptoms between those reporting positive and negative test results. METHOD: A Web page MyCovidSymptoms.ie was created by researchers at the National University of Ireland, Galway, in April 2020 to investigate COVID-19 symptoms in Ireland. The Web page invited participants to self-report RT-PCR test outcome data (positive, negative, untested), temperature and a range of symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of taste, loss of smell). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three Irish participants who had a RT-PCR test for COVID-19 logged their symptoms. Eighty-four patients reported that they tested positive for COVID-19, and 39 patients reported a negative COVID-19 test. In our cohort of respondents with a positive COVID-19 test, 49/84 (58%) respondents reported a cough. Of the 39 respondents with a negative COVID-19 test, 17 (44%) reported having a cough. The distribution of temperature was similar in both those with and without COVID-19. Levels of self-reported fatigue were high in both groups with 65/84 (77%) of COVID-19-positive patients reporting fatigue and 30/39 (77%) of those who were COVID-19-negative reporting fatigue. New symptoms emerging at the time of data collection included loss of taste and smell. We demonstrated a higher proportion of loss of smell (p = 0.02) and taste (p = 0.01) in those reporting a positive result, compared to those reporting a negative result. CONCLUSION: These data represents an early picture of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in an Irish population. It also highlights the potential use of self-reported data globally as a powerful tool in helping with the pandemic.","Gibbons, Claire; Hussain, Mouzzam; O039,; Keeffe, Derek T; Simpkin, Andrew J",Ir. j. med. sci,256,1

The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p < 0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the Subspecialised Primary Care Practice that were implemented during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic contributed containment of the pandemic. Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice indicated that physical separation of patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection was easier compared to those who continued working in their own practice. Additionally, leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident in dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge. Preservation of reimbursement and the reduction of regulatory burden that was initiated during the public health emergency will be necessary to maintain expanded patient access to the full complement of telestroke services.

The transmissibility of the disease is of great interest to healthcare workers and scientists alike. The primary route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, but viral RNA has also been found in feces and body fluids such as urine, serum, and semen. So far, there has been no report on whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the exudates of cutaneous lesions. This study was designed to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the pressure injury exudates in patients with severe COVID-19 infections. METHODS: 46 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU of the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan between February 4 and April 12 developed pressure injuries. 22 patients with pressure injuries had wound exudates. Wound and pharyngeal swabs of the 22 patients were collected and RT-PCRs were conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. RESULTS: At the time of pressure injury, 5 patients still tested positive by pharyngeal swabs, the rest of the 17 patients tested negative. However, none of the wound exudate swabs from the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that it is rather unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted via pressure injury exudates, but we still recommend standardized personal protective equipment, face shield and an additional pair of gloves when treating pressure injuries.","Yu, Nanze; Zhang, Yuwei; Xiao, Meng; Cao, Wei; Zhang, Yan; Yang, Yang; Liu, Zhengyin; Li, Yunzhu; Long, Xiao; Liu, Zhifei; Zhang, Shuyang; Wang, Xiaojun",J Cosmet Dermatol,256,22

In Brazil, municipalities were empowered to define regulatory measures, potentially resulting in diverse effects on CVD morbimortality. ObjectiveTo analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on CVD outcomes in Belo Horizonte (BH), the 6th greater capital city in Brazil, including: mortality, mortality at home, hospitalizations, intensive care unit utilization, and in-hospital mortality; and the differential effect according to sex, age range, social vulnerability, and pandemics phase. MethodsEcological study analysing data from the Mortality and Hospital Information System of BH residents aged [≥]30 years. CVD was defined as in Chapter IX from ICD-10. Social vulnerability was classified by a composite socioeconomic index as high, medium and low. The observed age-standardized rates for epidemiological weeks 10-48, 2020, were compared to the expected rates (mean of 2015-2019). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test differences, and risk ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. National demographic estimates was used to calculate rates. ResultsWe found no changes in CVD mortality rates (RiR 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06). However, CVD deaths occurred more at homes (RiR 1.32, 95%CI 1.20-1.46) than in hospitals (RiR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99), as a result of a substantial decline in hospitalization rates, even though proportional in-hospital deaths increased. The rise in home deaths was greater in older adults and in had an increasing gradient in those more socially vulnerable (RiR 1.45); for high (RiR 1.45), medium (RiR 1.32) and low vulnerability (RiR 1.21). ConclusionThe greater occurrence of CVD deaths at home, in parallel with lower hospitalization rates, suggests that CVD care was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemics, which more adversely affected older and more socially vulnerable individuals, exacerbating health inequities in BH.","Brant, Luisa Campos Caldeira; Pinheiro, Pedro C; Ribeiro, Antonio L P; Machado, Isis E; Correa, Paulo R L; Santos, Mayara R; Souza, Maria de Fatima M de; Malta, Deborah C; Passos, Valeria M A",,256,30

METHODS: A total of 373216 junior and senior high school students were recruited using a cluster sampling method in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xinyang city of Henan Province, China, during February 4-12, 2020. Presence of anxiety symptoms was determined by Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the potential risk factors. RESULTS: Among the participants, junior and senior high school students were found to have anxiety symptoms, producing an overall prevalence of 9.89%. The prevalence was lower in female than in male (9.66% vs. 10.11%) and the prevalence was higher for junior high school students than senior high school students (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural students and lowest among urban students (11.33% vs. 8.77%). The cognitive level was negatively associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for potential confounders, age, gender, residential location, worried level, fear level and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Prevalence may be skewed by assessing anxiety symptoms using self-reported scales rather than clinical interviews. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale study assesses the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its potential influencing factors in junior and senior high school students.

This study prospectively characterized gastrointestinal function and symptoms on each day throughout the menstrual cycle. METHODS: Healthy women aged 18-35 years (n = 78) who took OC participated in the 5-week observational study. Stool frequency, self-reported stress, stool form measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and gastrointestinal symptoms measured by a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) were assessed daily. GSRS scores were reported (1 = no discomfort at all, 7 = very severe discomfort) and were averaged for individual syndrome scores or summed for the total score. The validated, weekly version of the GSRS was completed at two time points to reflect menstruation and 1 week prior to menstruation (n = 72). Outcomes were analyzed in linear mixed models with the Dunnett's post hoc test against day 1 of menstrual bleeding or with nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Daily stress (P = 0.0018), BSFS score (P = 0.0493), stool frequency (P = 0.0241), abdominal pain (P < 0.0001), diarrhea (P = 0.0022), constipation (P = 0.0446), reflux (P = 0.0193), and indigestion (P < 0.0001) all varied significantly by the day of the menstrual cycle. Dunnett's post hoc tests showed that scores (mean ± SEM) on the first day of bleeding (day 1) for daily abdominal pain (2.6 ± 0.2), diarrhea (1.7 ± 0.1), and indigestion (2.1 ± 0.2) symptoms were higher than scores on all other days of the menstrual cycle (P < 0.05) with scores not on day 1 falling under 1.5, or between no discomfort at all and slight discomfort. Reflux, stool frequency, BSFS, self-reported stress, and constipation were higher on day 1 (P < 0.05) than on 12, 8, 6, 4, and 2 other days of the menstrual cycle, respectively. The median (IQR) GSRS score was higher during the week of menstruation than the week prior to menstruation for diarrhea [1.50 (1.00-2.33) vs 1.33 (1.00-2.00), P = 0.002] and abdominal pain [2.00 (1.33-2.67) vs 1.67 (1.33-2.33), P = 0.011] syndrome scores. CONCLUSION: Bowel habits appear to vary across the menstrual cycle and suggest more gastrointestinal discomfort on day 1 of menstrual bleeding in healthy women taking OC. Future interventional studies could identify ways to improve gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy women during menstruation.","Judkins, Taylor C; Dennis-Wall, Jennifer C; Sims, Shireen Madani; Colee, James; Langkamp-Henken, Bobbi",BMC Womens Health,256,1

In parallel with a relentless search for therapeutics and vaccines, considerable effort is being expended to develop ever more powerful technologies to restricting the spread of airborne microorganisms in indoor spaces through the minimization of health- and environment-related risks. In this context, UV-based and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-based technologies (i.e., the combined action of ultraviolet (UV) light and photocatalytic materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2)) represent the most widely utilized approaches at present because they are cost-effective and ecofriendly. The virucidal and bactericidal effect relies on the synergy between the inherent ability of UV light to directly inactivate viral particles and bacteria through nucleic acid and protein damages, and the production of oxidative radicals generated through the irradiation of the TiO2 surface. In this literature survey, we draw attention to the most effective UV radiations and TiO2-based PCO technologies available and their underlying mechanisms of action on both bacteria and viral particles. Since the fine tuning of different parameters, namely the UV wavelength, the photocatalyst composition, and the UV dose (viz, the product of UV light intensity and the irradiation time), is required for the inactivation of microorganisms, we wrap up this review coming up with the most effective combination of them. Now more than ever, UV- and TiO2-based disinfection technologies may represent a valuable tool to mitigate the spread of airborne pathogens.","Bono, Nina; Ponti, Federica; Punta, Carlo; Candiani, Gabriele",,256,20

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of 'proximity events' these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for 'intelligent physical distancing' in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response.

The residents have been affected by an almost complete upheaval of the previous setting of activities, with a near total focus on service during the peak of the emergency. In our Institution, residents in public health were extensively involved in leading activities in the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: We hereby provide a systematic description of the response actions in which the public health residents' workforce was pivotal, in a large tertiary hospital. RESULT: The key role played by residents in the response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic is highlighted by the diversity of contributions provided, from cooperation in the rearrangement of hospital paths for continuity of care, to establishing and running new services to support healthcare professionals. Overall, they constituted a workforce that turned essential in governing efficiently such a complex scenario.

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","Furman, Eugene; Cressman, Alex; Shin, Saeha; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Razak, Fahad; Verma, Amol; Diamant, Adam",,256,1

However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P < .001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P = .020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P = .001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.","Yu, Chong; Zhang, Zhiguo; Guo, Yujiao; Shi, Jing; Pei, Guangchang; Yao, Ying; Liao, Wenhui; Zeng, Rui",J. med. virol,256,16

Interviews were coded using principles of grounded theory. Father participation ranged from attendance at visits considered ""important"" (e.g., ultrasounds) to attendance at every appointment. Experiences of father participation varied, with many describing it as both an important act of support for the mother and part of assuming the role of father. Most participants saw great value in father participation in prenatal care as an opportunity for fathers to learn how to support a healthy pregnancy, bond with their developing baby, and share joy and/or worries with mothers. Participants generally felt that fathers were made to feel welcome and wanted providers to be inclusive of fathers during appointments.

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively.

This study was conducted in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq using a self-administered online questionnaire survey after the COVID-19 lockdown period in June 2020. Data were collected from a sample of 346 married women about the occurrence, frequency, and forms of spousal violence before and during the lockdown period. Significant increases in violence were observed from the pre-lockdown period to the lockdown period for any violence (32.1% to 38.7%, p = .001), emotional abuse (29.5% to 35.0%, p = .005), and physical violence (12.7% to 17.6%, p = .002). Regarding emotional abuse, humiliation (24.6% to 28.3%, p = .041) and scaring or intimidation (14.2% to 21.4%, p < .001) significantly increased during the lockdown. For physical violence, twisting the arm or pulling hair (9.0% to 13.0%, p = .004) and hitting (5.2% to 9.2%, p = .003) significantly increased during the lockdown.

As for now, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: Polyphenolic compounds have potential as drug candidates for various diseases, including viral infections. In this study, polyphenolic compounds contained in Geranii Herba were chosen for an in silico approach. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), 3CLpro (Replicase polyprotein 1ab), and the cell surface receptor glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were chosen as target proteins. RESULTS: Based on the molecular docking analysis, ellagic acid, gallic acid, geraniin, kaempferitrin, kaempferol, and quercetin showed significant binding interactions with the target proteins. Besides, the molecular dynamic simulation studies support Geranii Herba's inhibition efficiency on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We assume that the active compounds in Geranii Herba might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through the ACE2 receptor and inhibit the proteolytic process. Besides, these compounds may help to regulate the cell signaling under the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum stress through the binding with GRP78 and avoid the SARS-CoV-2 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the compounds present in Geranii Herba could be used as possible drug candidates for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Arokiyaraj, Selvaraj; Stalin, Antony; Kannan, Balakrishnan Senthamarai; Shin, Hakdong",,256,26

Since developing antiviral drugs is a time-consuming process, the most effective approach is to evaluate the approved and under investigation drugs using in silico methods. Among the different targets within the virus structure, as a vital component in the life cycle of coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can be a critical target for antiviral drugs. The impact of the existence of RNA in the enzyme structure on the binding affinity of anti-RdRP drugs has not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this study, the potential anti-RdRP effects of a variety of drugs from two databases (Zinc database and DrugBank) were evaluated using molecular docking. For this purpose, the newly emerged model of COVID-19 (RdRP) post-translocated catalytic complex (PDB ID: 7BZF) that consists of RNA was chosen as the target. RESULTS: The results indicated that idarubicin (IDR), a member of the anthracycline antibiotic family, and fenoterol (FNT), a known beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug, tightly bind to the target enzyme and could be used as potential anti-RdRP inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These outcomes revealed that due to the ligand-protein interactions, the presence of RNA in this structure could remarkably affect the binding affinity of inhibitor compounds. CONCLUSION: In silico approaches, such as molecular docking, could effectively address the problem of finding appropriate treatment for COVID-19. Our results showed that IDR and FNT have a significant affinity to the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, these drugs are remarkable inhibitors of coronaviruses.","Poustforoosh, Alireza; Hashemipour, Hassan; Tüzün, Burak; Pardakhty, Abbas; Mehrabani, Mehrnaz; Nematollahi, Mohammad Hadi",Biophys Chem,256,16

Triage guidelines, however, differ on whether limited resources should focus on maximizing lives or life-years. Choosing between these two approaches has implications for neonatology. Neonatal units have ventilators, some adaptable for adults. This raises the question of whether, in crisis conditions, guidelines for treating extremely premature babies should be altered to free-up ventilators. Some adults who need ventilators will have a survival rate higher than some extremely premature babies. But surviving babies will likely live longer, maximizing life-years. Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults. When ""triaging"" or choosing between patients, justice demands fair guidelines. Premature babies do not deserve special consideration; they deserve equal consideration. Solidarity is crucial but must consider needs specific to patient populations and avoid biases against people with disabilities and extremely premature babies.","Haward, Marlyse F; Janvier, Annie; Moore, Gregory P; Laventhal, Naomi; Fry, Jessica T; Lantos, John",Am J Bioeth,256,16

It caused stress on the health care system of all countries. Presently, studies are emerging regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in different aspects. However, a few have explored barriers that affecting the practice of preventive measures for the COVID-19. As such, the study aimed to fill these research gaps in the study setting. METHODS: A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct this phenomenological study among 16 key informants. Key informants were recruited by the purposive sampling method. To analyze that data, thematic content analysis was employed by using an inductive approach in NVivo 12 Pro software. RESULTS: In this study, six main themes were identified with the sub-themes. Overview of COVID-19 pandemic (with the six sub-themes), consequences (with the two sub-themes), perceived practice (with four sub-themes), perceived barriers (with four sub-themes), newfangled activities (with three sub-themes), and suggestion for improvement (with seven sub-themes) were the major themes. The participants perceived the influence of shortage of personal protective equipment and solutions for hand hygiene, negligence and ignorance, inadequate infrastructure, lack of training, and lack of attention and recognition for the staff on the practice of preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a gap in preventive measure practices for the COVID-19 in the health care system. Community influences, health care provider related barriers, institutional barriers, and lack of communication and support affect the practice. Hence, attention should give to fulfill the necessary supplies in the health facilities, improve the infrastructures, and equip health professionals by providing capacity-building activities. Besides, health care workers must recognize, and attention is needed.","Mersha, Abera; Shibiru, Shitaye; Girma, Meseret; Ayele, Gistane; Bante, Agegnehu; Kassa, Mekidim; Abebe, Sintayehu; Shewangizaw, Misgun",BMC Public Health,256,6

In this paper, we study the impact of population movement on the spread of COVID-19, and we capitalize on recent advances in the field of representation learning on graphs to capture the underlying dynamics. Specifically, we create a graph where nodes correspond to a country's regions and the edge weights denote human mobility from one region to another. Then, we employ graph neural networks to predict the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic's asynchronous outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method to transfer knowledge from one country's model to another's. We compare the proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting techniques in 3 European countries. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the usefulness of GNNs in epidemiological prediction. Transfer learning provides the best model, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy of the predictions in case of secondary waves, if data from past/parallel outbreaks is utilized.","Panagopoulos, George; Nikolentzos, Giannis; Vazirgiannis, Michalis",,256,19

Since the first diagnosis on February 3rd, the epidemic has quickly evolved, with Belgium at the crossroads of Europe, being one of the hardest hit countries. Although risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19 patients have been described in Chinese and United States (US) cohorts, good quality studies reporting on clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcome of European COVID-19 patients are still scarce. METHODS: This study describes the clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes of 319 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, admitted to a tertiary care center at the start of the pandemic in Belgium, and aims to identify the main risk factors for in-hospital mortality in a European context using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Most patients were male (60%), the median age was 74 (IQR 61-83) and 20% of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, of whom 63% needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall case fatality rate was 25%. The best predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis were older age, and renal insufficiency, higher lactate dehydrogenase and thrombocytopenia. Patients admitted early in the epidemic had a higher mortality compared to patients admitted later in the epidemic. In univariate analysis, patients with obesity did have an overall increased risk of death, while overweight on the other hand showed a trend towards lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first weeks of the epidemic in Belgium were admitted with severe disease and the overall case fatality rate was high. The identified risk factors for mortality are not easily amenable at short term, underscoring the lasting need of effective therapeutic and preventative measures.","van Halem, Karlijn; Bruyndonckx, Robin; van der Hilst, Jeroen; Cox, Janneke; Driesen, Paulien; Opsomer, Matthias; Van Steenkiste, Eveline; Stessel, Björn; Dubois, Jasperina; Messiaen, Peter",BMC Infect Dis,256,17

The COVID-19 pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was formerly identified in 2003. The contagiousness, dynamics of the pathogen, and mobility of the general population incurred the occurrence of underestimation of infection (i.e., the unidentified cases and the gap with the identified cases) that was potentially substantial in magnitude, which was supposed to connect with subsequent cyclical outbreaks in practice. We employed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Contained (SIR-C) mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, then asymptotically simulated the peak sizes and peak dates of the identified and unidentified cases, the underestimation, and the dynamics of the gap. The simulation outcomes indicated that unidentified peak dates in practice could predate the reported peak dates for a variable period of weeks or months. In comparison, the saturation sizes of infection remained at commensurate levels. The curve of the initial exponential-like outbreak for the undocumented cases would flatten when the gap between concurrent identified cases and unidentified cases decreased. The rate of non-pharmaceutical containment could impact the trend of disease transmission ceteris paribus, and the greater the rate the larger reduction of infections. When the rate reached a certain level of threshold, the undocumented curve would shift from flattening effect to decaying effect. A similar trend was observed when it applied to the rate of pharmaceutical containment measures ceteris paribus. The results were sensitive to the duration of infection (DOI), it manifested that greater values of DOI were associated with greater peak sizes and greater peak dates for both documented and undocumented cases. Conditional on assumptions, calibration of DOI from 8 days to 18 days would increase the unidentified peak size by nearly 56% and the peak date by almost 18 days.","Nakamoto, Ichiro; Zhang, Jilin",Results Phys,256,16

Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the""COVID-FACT"". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts.","Heidarian, Shahin; Afshar, Parnian; Enshaei, Nastaran; Naderkhani, Farnoosh; Oikonomou, Anastasia; Atashzar, S.

According to past studies, positive support within married couples reduces stress during diseases and disasters, but their mechanisms are unclear. To address this gap and help individuals better cope with COVID-19-related psychological distress, this study examined the relationships among daily positive support, daily gratitude, and daily stress within married couples. In this 14-day daily diary study, 54 heterosexually married couples (N = 108) aged 28 to 71 years participated. After reporting their demographic information at the start of the study, they reported their perceived positive support from their partner, daily stress, and feelings of gratitude at the end of each day of the study for 14 consecutive days. Using a multivariate outcome, multilevel cross-classification, we found that daily positive support was negatively associated with daily stress, mediated by daily feelings of gratitude. On a day when a person reported more perceived positive support than others, this person also reported a higher level of feelings of gratitude and a lower level of stress, regardless of age. We found only an actor effect, no partner effect. These findings show how greater daily positive support is linked to greater daily feelings of gratitude, which in turn is linked to less daily stress during an emergent public health crisis.

Yet, currently, there is no standard way of assessing this. Available HIV prevention indicators do not provide a logical set of measures that combine to show reduction in HIV incidence and allow for comparison of success (or failure) of HIV prevention programmes and for monitoring progress in meeting global targets. To redress this, attention increasingly has turned to the prospects of devising an HIV prevention cascade, similar to the now-standard HIV treatment cascade; but this has proven to be a controversial enterprise, chiefly due to the complexity of primary prevention. DISCUSSION: We address a number of core issues attendant with devising prevention cascades, including: determining the population of interest and accounting for the variability and fluidity of HIV-related risk within it; the fact that there are multiple HIV prevention methods, and many people are exposed to a package of them, rather than a single method; and choosing the final step (outcome) in the cascade. We propose two unifying models of prevention cascades-one more appropriate for programme managers and monitors and the other for researchers and programme developers-and note their relationship. We also provide some considerations related to cascade data quality and improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV prevention field has been grappling for years with the idea of developing a standardised way to regularly assess progress and to monitor and improve programmes accordingly.

Twelve percent of SARS-CoV-2-infected children had viral co-infection with one or more common respiratory viruses. This was significantly more frequent than among their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts (0%; p=0.028). Compared to the same period the previous year, common respiratory viruses were less frequently detected (12% vs 73%, p<0.001).Conclusion: Despite partial lockdown with school and daycare closure, and consequently similar exposure to common viruses between children and adults, SARS-CoV-2-infected children had more frequent viral respiratory co-infections than their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts. Circulation of common respiratory viruses was less frequent during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak when compared to the same period last year, showing the impact of partial lockdown on the circulation of common viruses. What is Known: â¢ Viral respiratory co-infections are frequent in children. â¢ SARS-CoV-2 can be identified alongside other respiratory viruses, but data comparing children and adults are lacking. What is New: â¢ Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to have viral respiratory co-infections than their SARS-CoV-2-infected adult household contacts, which is surprising in the context of partial lockdown with schools and daycare closed. â¢ When compared to data collected during the same period last year, our study also showed that partial lockdown reduced circulation of common respiratory viruses.","Pigny, Fiona; Wagner, Noémie; Rohr, Marie; Mamin, Aline; Cherpillod, Pascal; Posfay-Barbe, Klara M; Kaiser, Laurent; Eckerle, Isabella; L039,; Huillier, Arnaud G",Eur. j. pediatr,256,16

Here, we analyse an ethnically diverse cohort of National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (UK) to assess the association between variants in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 risk. MethodsWe analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 6,274 participants who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from the UKs 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) for the presence of ACE2 coding variants and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). FindingsWe identified a splice site variant (rs2285666) associated with increased ACE2 expression with an overrepresentation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to 100KGP controls (p = .015), and in hospitalised European patients relative to outpatients in intra-ethnic comparisons (p = .029). We also compared the prevalence of 288 eQTLs, of which 23 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. The eQTL rs12006793 had the largest effect size (d = 0.91), which decreases ACE2 expression and is more prevalent in controls, thus potentially reducing risk of COVID-19. We identified three novel nonsynonymous variants predicted to alter ACE2 function, and showed that three variants (p.K26R, p.H378R, p.Y515N) alter receptor affinity for the viral Spike (S) protein. Variants p.K26R and p.N720D are more prevalent in the European population (p < .001), but Y497H is less prevalent compared to East Asians (p = .020). InterpretationOur results demonstrate that the spectrum of genetic variants in ACE2 may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and could partially explain the differences in disease susceptibility and severity among different ethnic groups.

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven relatively straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. We systematically developed an ELISA, optimizing different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid, enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from a minority of RT-PCR confirmed, non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals, and these were mostly subjects who had the highest levels of anti-spike serum antibodies. Therefore, detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum can contribute to determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Faustini, Sian E; Jossi, Sian E; Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Shields, Adrian M; Allen, Joel D; Watanabe, Yasunori; Newby, Maddy L; Cook, Alex; Willcox, Carrie R; Salim, Mahboob; Goodall, Margaret; Heaney, Jennifer L; Marcial-Juarez, Edith; Morley, Gabriella L; Torlinska, Barbara; Wraith, David C; Veenith, Tonny V; Harding, Stephen; Jolles, Stephen; Ponsford, Mark J; Plant, Tim; Huissoon, Aarnoud; O039,; Shea, Matthew K; Willcox, Benjamin E; Drayson, Mark T; Crispin, Max; Cunningham, Adam F; Richter, Alex G",Immunology,256,31

Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS: Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS: Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","Hidvégi, Máté; Nichelatti, Michele",Isr Med Assoc J,256,28

We examine how emotion regulation and brain structure and function are associated with internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and moderate the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems. Methods Data are from a longitudinal sample (N=145, aged 10-15) strategically assessed at three crucial timepoints: prior to the pandemic, early during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later. We examined associations of amygdala and hippocampal volume and amygdala activation during an emotional processing task prior to the pandemic;use of emotion regulation strategies prior to and during the pandemic;and pandemic-related stressors with internalizing problems. Results Greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with higher internalizing problems both early and later in the pandemic. Youths who reported more frequent use of rumination before the pandemic and higher use of expressive suppression and lower use of cognitive reappraisal early in the pandemic had higher internalizing problems early in the pandemic. Higher left amygdala activation to neutral relative to fearful faces before the pandemic was associated with greater internalizing problems and a stronger link between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems early in the pandemic. Conclusion Pandemic-related stressors are strongly associated with adolescent internalizing problems, as are individual differences in emotional reactivity and regulation and their underlying neural mechanisms. Interventions that reduce pandemic-related stressors and foster adaptive emotion regulation skills may protect against adolescent psychopathology during this period of heightened exposure to stress.","Weissman, David G.; Rodman, Alexandra M.; Rosen, Maya L.; Kasparek, Steven Mayes Makeda Sheridan Margaret A.; Lengua, Lilliana Meltzoff Andrew N.; McLaughlin, Katie A.",Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science,256,16

With a death toll surpassing 500,000 in the United States alone, containing the pandemic is predicated on achieving herd immunity on a global scale. This implies that at least 70-80 % of the population must achieve active immunity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), either as a result of a previous COVID-19 infection or by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2020, the first two vaccines were approved by the FDA through emergency use authorization in the United States. These vaccines are based on the mRNA vaccine platform and were developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Published safety and efficacy trials reported high efficacy rates of 94-95 % after two interval doses, in conjunction with limited side effects and a low rate of adverse reactions. The rapid pace of vaccine development and the uncertainty of potential long-term adverse effects raised some level of hesitation against mRNA vaccines in the global community. A successful vaccination campaign is contingent on widespread access to the vaccine under appropriate storage conditions, deployment of a sufficient number of vaccinators, and the willingness of the population to be vaccinated. Thus, it is important to clarify the objective data related to vaccine safety, including known side effects and potential adverse reactions. The present review was designed to provide an update on the current state of science related to the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Anand, P.; Stahel, V.

Based on current CDC COVID-19 mitigation recommendations related to events and gatherings (2), Major League Baseball (MLB) developed new health and safety protocols before the July 24 start of the 2020 season. In addition, MLB made the decision that games would be played without spectators. Before a three-game series between teams A and B, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health was notified of a team A player with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; the player was isolated as recommended (2). During the series and the week after, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was diagnosed among 19 additional team A players and staff members and one team B staff member. Throughout their potentially infectious periods, some asymptomatic team A players and coaches, who subsequently received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, engaged in on-field play with teams B and C. No on-field team B or team C players or staff members subsequently received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Certain MLB health and safety protocols, which include frequent diagnostic testing for rapid case identification, isolation of persons with positive test results, quarantine for close contacts, mask wearing, and social distancing, might have limited COVID-19 transmission between teams.","Murray, Meghan T; Riggs, Margaret A; Engelthaler, David M; Johnson, Caroline; Watkins, Sharon; Longenberger, Allison; Brett-Major, David M; Lowe, John; Broadhurst, M Jana; Ladva, Chandresh N; Villanueva, Julie M; MacNeil, Adam; Qari, Shoukat; Kirking, Hannah L; Cherry, Michael; Khan, Ali S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,256,29

The dynamics of airflow through the respiratory tract during VB and BB are investigated using the nonlinear time series and complexity analyses in terms of the phase portrait, fractal dimension, Hurst exponent, and sample entropy. The higher degree of chaoticity in BB relative to VB is unwrapped through the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The principal component analysis helps in classifying VB and BB sound signals through the feature extraction from the power spectral density data.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. DESIGN: Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. RESULTS: Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo + AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.","Lednev, Egor M; Kravchenko, Irina V; Furalyov, Vladimir A; Lysenko, Evgeny A; Lemesheva, Iulia S; Grushin, Alexandr A; Dubrov, Vadim E; Vinogradova, Olga L; Popov, Daniil V",Growth Horm IGF Res,256,1

BACKGROUND: The medication management process includes all structures and practices within the organisation that guide and support medication administration and related procedures. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. METHODS: A Finnish version of the Medication Administration System - Nurses Assessment of Satisfaction (modified MAS-NAS) paper-based questionnaire was sent to all nursing staff (N = 855) working in operative (n = 498) and psychiatric (n = 357) domains in one central hospital. Data were analysed using statistical methods. RESULTS: In total, 324 nursing staff members participated. More than half agreed that medication management is efficient (64%), safe for patients (76%), and that the current medication administration system provides the necessary medical treatment information (e.g. prescriptions by physicians, medication data) (64%). Respondents' overall satisfaction with medication management process was slightly above average on a scale from 1 to 10 (mean = 6.2; SD = 1.8; median = 7, range 2-9). Respondents who used electronic medication chart reported higher overall satisfaction with medication management process (median = 7, mean = 6.1, SD = 1.8 and range 2-9) than those not using it (median = 6.5, mean = 6.3, SD = 1.6 and range 2-9). No statistically significant difference was found (U = 8552.000, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed several problems in the medication management process. The results can be used in developing the medication management process. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Electronic medication chart should be used and developed further in terms of efficacy, safety and access. One year after the electronic medication chart was introduced, only half of the respondents had used it. That is why implementation of electronic systems or technological applications should be carefully considered as a whole.","Kuusisto, Anne; Santavirta, Jenni; Saranto, Kaija; Suominen, Tarja; Asikainen, Paula",Scand. j. caring sci,256,20

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to increase the risk of lung cancer. PAHs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A subfamily, comprised of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 monooxygenases. These enzymes bioactivate PAHs into reactive metabolites that induce mutagenic DNA adducts, which can lead to cancer. Past studies have investigated the role of CYP1A1 in PAH bioactivation; however, the individual roles of each CYP1A enzyme are still unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 or Cyp1a2 will display altered susceptibilities to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT), Cyp1a1-null (Cyp1a1-/-), and Cyp1a2-null (Cyp1a2-/-) male and female mice were treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) for cancer initiation and tumor formation studies. In WT mice, CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression was induced by MC. Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a2-/- mice treated with PAHs displayed a compensatory pattern, where knocking out one Cyp1a gene led to increased expression of the other. Cyp1a1-/- mice were resistant to DNA adduct and tumor formation, while Cyp1a2-/- mice displayed increased levels of both. UALCAN analysis revealed that lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with high levels of CYP1A2 expression survive significantly better than patients with low/medium expression. In conclusion, Cyp1a1-/- mice were less susceptible to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis, while Cyp1a2-/- mice were more susceptible. Additionally, high CYP1A2 expression was found to be protective for LUAD patients. These results support the need to develop novel CYP1A1 inhibitors to mitigate human lung cancer.","Gastelum, Grady; Jiang, Weiwu; Wang, Lihua; Zhou, Guodong; Borkar, Roshan; Putluri, Nagireddy; Moorthy, Bhagavatula",Toxicol. sci,256,8

Objectives: This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions have explored our study's second and third aims. Results: A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR = 0.64, P = 0.022; 95% CI: 0.44-0.94), and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, P = 0.048; 95% CI: 0.01-0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, P = 0.049; 95% CI: 1.10-3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR = 2.49, P = 0.007; 95% CI: 1.29-4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media platforms (n = 269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning as their most distressing concern. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the mental health of individuals, including students.

The present research aimed to develop and evaluate a new parent-report questionnaire that measures the time children spend playing across a range of places and includes a supplement to evaluate how adventurously children play. METHODS: The questionnaire was developed with input from a diverse group of parents and experts in children's play. It was designed to yield a range of metrics including time spent playing per year, time spent playing outside, time spent playing in nature and level of adventurous play. The reliability of the questionnaire was then evaluated with 245 parents (149 mothers, 96 fathers) of 154 children aged 5-11 years. All participants completed the measure at time 1. At time 2, an average of 20 days later, 184 parents (111 mothers and 73 fathers) of 99 children completed the measure again. RESULTS: Cross-informant agreement, evaluated using Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCCs), ranged from 0.36 to 0.51. These fall in the poor to moderate range and are largely comparable to cross-informant agreement on other measures. Test-retest reliability for mothers was good (range 0.67-0.76) for time spent playing metrics. For fathers, test-retest reliability was lower (range 0.39-0.63). For both parents the average level of adventurous play variable had relatively poor test retest reliability (mothers = 0.49, fathers = 0.42). This variable also showed a significant increase from time 1 to time 2. This instability over time may be due to the timing of the research in relation to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated shifts in risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: The measure will be of value in future research focusing on the public health benefits and correlates of children's play as well as researchers interested in children's outdoor play and play in nature specifically. The development of the measure in collaboration with parents and experts in children's play is a significant strength. It will be of value for future research to further validate the measure against play diaries or activity monitors.","Dodd, Helen F; Nesbit, Rachel J; Maratchi, Laura R",BMC Public Health,256,16

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of peracetic acid (PAA) dry fogging in decontaminating healthcare facility surfaces experimentally contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nine materials (stainless steel, latex painted wood, unsealed hardwood, melamine countertop, vinyl flooring, clear plastic, faux leather, computer keyboard button, and smartphone touch screen) were surface contaminated with >106 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2, and allowed to dry before exposing to PAA dry fogging. FINDINGS: When fumigated with PAA dry fog for 1 h, no infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered from any of the experimentally inoculated surface types. By contrast, high titres of infectious virus were recovered from corresponding untreated drying controls of the same materials. CONCLUSION: Standard surface decontamination processes, including sprays and wipes, are laborious and frequently cannot completely decontaminate sensitive electronic equipment. The ease of use, low cost, and overall effectiveness of a PAA dry fogging suggest that it should be considered for decontaminating healthcare settings, particularly intensive care units where severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients are cared for.","Cutts, T; Kasloff, S; Safronetz, D; Krishnan, J",J Hosp Infect,256,20
469149,469149,469149,Is the anti-filarial drug diethylcarbamazine useful to treat COVID-19?,15.3012295,6.9074426,2020,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mycobacterial immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients with HIV-1 infection result from immunopathology that is characterized by increased production of multiple pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines associated with activation of myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils). We propose that both conditions arise because innate immune responses generated in the absence of effective adaptive immune responses lead to monocyte/macrophage activation that is amplified by the emergence of a pathogen-specific adaptive immune response skewed towards monocyte/macrophage activating activity by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced during the innate response, particularly interleukin-18. In mycobacterial IRIS, that disease-enhancing immune response is dominated by a Th1 CD4+ T cell response against mycobacterial antigens. By analogy, it is proposed that in severe COVID-19, amplification of monocyte/macrophage activation results from the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody response with pro-inflammatory characteristics, including high proportions of IgG3 and IgA2 antibodies and afucosylation of IgG1 antibodies, that arises from B cell differentiation in an extra-follicular pathway promoted by activation of mucosa-associated invariant T cells. We suggest that therapy for the hyperinflammation underlying both COVID-19 and mycobacterial IRIS might be improved by targeting the immunomodulatory as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of the 'cytokine storm'.","Seddiki, Nabila; French, Martyn",Front Immunol,256,24

It describes the pandemic's impact thus far by looking at payroll jobs, the unemployment rate, a broader measure of job disruptions, and disparities by race and sex. The conclusion discusses forces that will drive outcomes in the coming months. The findings are as follows: (1) The COVID-19 shock was very abrupt and deep by historical standards, and headline numbers understate the magnitude of job disruptions. (2) The pace of the jobs recovery has slowed markedly since June. (3) The share of disrupted workers with ties to employers, which began very high, is falling rapidly, dimming prospects for further rapid recovery. (4) Hispanic, African American and women workers' jobs were more disrupted than others'. (5) Prospects for a speedy jobs recovery depend strongly on the path of the pandemic and degree of fiscal stimulus, both aided by official statistics to guide decisions at all levels during this critical time.","Groshen, Erica L",Bus Econ,256,24

In managing students' return to the clinical setting, medical schools face the challenge of balancing education, service and risk considerations. To compound this challenge, medical students may prefer not to re-enter during a period of great uncertainty, leading to substantive downstream sequelae on individual, institutional and national levels. Understanding students' views on resuming clinical experiences, therefore, is an important consideration. The purpose of this study was to assess medical students' preference for re-entering the clinical setting during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore personal and environmental characteristics associated with that preference. METHODS: We conducted an electronic survey of currently enrolled medical students at the Duke-NUS Medical School, less than a month into the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey items were aligned with a conceptual framework related to medical students' preference for returning to the clinical setting. The framework consisted of three domains: (a) non-modifiable demographic information; (b) factors thought to be modifiable through the course of medical education, including burnout, tolerance for ambiguity, motivation and professionalism, and (c) students' perception of COVID-19 infection risk to self. RESULTS: Approximately one-third (n=63) of 179 students preferred not to return to the clinical setting. Results of a multivariable analysis indicated that compared to this group, the two-thirds (n=116) of students favouring return showed evidence of greater autonomous (or internal) motivation, a greater sense of professional responsibility and a lower self-perception of harbouring risk to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Students' preference on returning to the clinical environment stems from the interplay of several key factors, and is substantively associated with perceptions of professional responsibility and their own potential risk to the health care system. Mindfully considering and addressing these issues may help medical schools in their preparation for returning students to the clinical setting.","Compton, Scott; Sarraf-Yazdi, Shiva; Rustandy, Felicia; Radha Krishna, Lalit Kumar",Med. educ,256,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation and disinformation have spread widely, threatening to drown out credible sources of information. The outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic making it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. The aim of this commentary is to analyse the dangerous role of fake news and misinformation while the world is in thrall to COVID-19. It begins with a short discussion on post-truth and emo-truth and describes how emo-truth political manifestations are examples of toxic masculinities' aggression. It will also look at the politicisation of masks and how misinformation can hinder compliance to mask adherence. The refusal to wear a mask also became a widely recognized sign of toxic masculinity in reporting around the world. The second half of the paper deals with the role of false truths in fake treatment and public trust in vaccines against COVID-19. The use of fake products and medicines results in a major risk to the health and safety of patients and need to be taken seriously. Political polarisation and online misinformation are also threatening vaccination programmes worldwide, with public trust best described as fickle, volatile and varying widely between countries. In this concoction of fake news, fake treatments and public distrust it is imperative not to capitalise on fears and politicise an already fraught situation. It is only then that public health officials will successfully convey evidence based information.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,256,10

Research indicates that patients with mental illness are willing to engage in the use of telemonitoring and mobile technology to assess and monitor their mood states. However, without the provision of distant support, adverse outcomes and events may be difficult to prevent and manage through self-monitoring. Understanding patient perspectives is important to achieving the best balance of self-monitoring, patient empowerment, and distant supporter involvement. METHODS: This systematic review synthesises quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of daily/weekly/monthly remote mood monitoring that includes distant support in participants with mood disorders. Inclusion criteria comprised mood monitoring of mood disorder patients as main intervention, study design, method of monitoring, and presence of psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Effectiveness was defined by the change in depression and/or mania scores. Feasibility was determined on participant feedback and completion/attrition rates. Studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2018. RESULTS: Nine studies of acceptable quality met the inclusion criteria. Distant mood monitoring was effective in improving depression scores but not mania scores. Feasibility, as measured through compliance and completion rates and participant feedback, varied. CONCLUSION: Distant mood monitoring with support may be a useful, acceptable, and feasible intervention for diverse groups of patients in terms of age and ethnicity. Further, it may be effective in improving symptoms of depression, increasing treatment adherence, and facilitating the prevention and management of adverse outcomes. As a task-shifting intervention, distant mood monitoring may help to alleviate the burden on mental health providers in developing countries.","van der Watt, A S J; Odendaal, W; Louw, K; Seedat, S",BMC Psychiatry,256,16

This article examines changes in the legal protection of animals during this time and the impact this will have on research and scholarship in the law relating to animals. We examine whether the overall international treatment of animals has improved and how far the approach to the Animal Law curriculum should be influenced by the growth in concerns around climate change. In this context, we examine the development of the law of ecocide and the extent to which it addresses concerns around animal welfare across the globe. We suggest that those involved in the development of Animal Law, ethics and policy might usefully engage in a new vision of ecocide, which incorporates a clearer notion of 'animal ecocide'. This new approach would enhance the international and national focus on animals in their own right, would recognise increasing knowledge of animal sentience and would move our responsibilities to them beyond anthropocentric approaches to environmental protection. We argue that the inclusion of a more specific reference to animal ecocide would contribute to the development of Animal Law and would lead to an enhanced relationship between Animal Law and attempts to protect the environment.","Legge, Debbie; Brooman, Simon",Liverp Law Rev,256,16

The development of biodegradable packaging has been growing in recent years due to the demand for food safety and quality. This work aimed to prepare PBAT active films loaded with cellulose nanofibers (CNF) embedded with cinnamon essential oil (EO) by the wire extension method. The possible interactions between NC-EO-PBAT were investigated, and the results confirmed the EO presence that physically interacted with the PBAT matrix, altering the polymeric molecular conformations. All films showed high thermal stability, being adequate for application in the food industry. The films containing the modified-CNF showed a Fickian controlled diffusion, and the higher essential oil release was verified for lower filler contents. The modified-CNF decreased the water vapor permeability due to the oil hydrophobic oil and good filler dispersion, which impacted the film's performance as packaging for strawberries. The fruits packed in films with 0.5 wt% of modified-CNF have lower weight loss after 15 days of storage, better freshness preservation, and no fungal attack. The results indicated that the developed films improved the strawberries' qualities and have antimicrobial properties against Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, offering a potential alternative to synthetic materials as food packaging.","Montero, Yasmim de Souza Alana Gabrieli de Oliveira Éder Ramin dos Santos Rosa Derval",Sustainable Materials and Technologies,256,16

The aim of the current study is to validate a Turkish version of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief English-language mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. Participants were assessed using the PGS, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). We surveyed 758 Turkish native speakers who participated online. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factor structure of the PGS was satisfactory. The scale was internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 and a composite reliability of 0.90. The PGS demonstrated construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. Positive correlations of the PGS with the PHQ-4 and the WSAS demonstrated adequate convergent validity. The PGS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of &#8805; 3 (89% sensitivity and 72% specificity). The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining most of the variance (43%) in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These findings closely replicate the original validation study on the PGS in English and suggest that the current Turkish version of the PGS is a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death.","Evren, Cuneyt; Evren, Bilge; Dalbudak, Ercan; Topcu, Merve; Kutlu, Nilay",Death Stud,256,11

One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS: Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS: Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a wide range of services and types of assessments may be amenable to telehealth procedures. Further, the findings have immediate applications as the field shifts towards telehealth due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Bullard, Lauren; Harvey, Danielle; Abbeduto, Leonard",J Telemed Telecare,256,20

This study aimed to provide insight into this issue. We carried out a retrospective analysis of the clinical data, autopsy, and microscopic findings in 4 pregnant women with severe COVID-19. Patients were admitted 4-5 days after COVID-19 onset with fever, dry cough, and reduced saturation. Positive SARSCoV2 nasopharyngeal swab PCRs were obtained. Chest CT revealed bilateral 'ground glass' pneumonia, CT 3-4. The women were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 requiring ALV and ECMO. They underwent emergent C-section with subsequent therapy. Patient 1, 37 y.o., 28-29 gestation weeks (GW), had comorbid conditions-obesity and arterial hypertension, died on the 11th bed-day (BD) due to pulmonary embolism. Patient 2, 31 y.o., 27 GW, developed bacterial pneumonia and acute pansinusitis with multiple organ failure resulting in death on 15th BD. Patient 3, 22 y.o., 35 GW, had ventilatorassociated pneumonia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and phlebothrombosis as COVID-19 complications. Later, she developed sepsis, which resulted in a lethal outcome (on 26th BD). Patient 4, 38 y.o., 32 GW, was diagnosed with pneumothorax on the 10th BD requiring pleural cavity drainage. The disease was complicated by bacterial pneumonia leading to respiratory failure and death (on the 30th BD). At autopsy, all four women had 'shock lungs' and diffuse alveolar damage at microscopy. Microscopic evaluation of the 1st patient's lung specimens revealed hyaline membranes corresponding to exudative DAD phase combined with proliferative DAD signs. In the 2nd case, we observed a pronounced cytopathic effect resulting in 'ugly' multinucleated cell formation, and multiple hemosiderophages in the alveolar lumens, as well as alveolar and bronchial metaplasia, confirmed by positive CK5-6 IHC staining. Third patient lung specimens demonstrated organizing viral pneumonia (with interalveolar granulation tissue, numerous interalveolar siderophages, indicating an alveolar-hemorrhagic syndrome) combined with massive bacterial pneumonia. Organizing viral pneumonia with mature interalveolar granulation tissue and sarcoid-like granulomas was diagnosed in 4 patient. Clinical and morphological analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 pneumonia features are similar for pregnant and non-pregnant patients of the same age group. The proliferative DAD phase was detected in three of 4 cases. However, of special interest is the first case, in which a combination of DAD phases was determined. At the same time, no severe obstetric complications were identified, which we associate with the timely diagnosis and prevention measures.","Mikhaleva, L. M.; Zayratyants, O. V.; Vasyukova, O.

METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the internal medicine department of a general hospital with a diagnosis of non-critical COVID-19, who performed a Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for respiratory deterioration in April 2020, were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Study populations: 41 subjects, median(IRQ)age:71.7(63-76)years, CPTA confirmed APE=8(19.51%,CI95%:8.82%-34.87%). Among patients with and without APE, no significant differences were found with regards symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, Wells score and outcomes. The optimal cut-off value of D-dimer for predicting APE was 2454 ng/mL, sensitivity(CI95%):63(24-91), specificity:73(54-87), Positive Predictive Value:36(13-65), Negative Predictive Value: 89(71-98) and AUC:0.62(0.38-0.85). The standard and age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs, and the Wells score >2 did not associate with confirmed APE, albeit a cut-off value of D-dimer=2454 ng/mL showed an RR:3.21;CI95%:0.92-13.97;p=0.073. Heparin at anticoagulant doses was used in 70.73% of patients before performing CTPA. CONCLUSION: Among patients presenting pulmonary deterioration after hospitalization for non-critical COVID-19, the prevalence of APE is high. Traditional diagnostic tools to identify high APE pre-test probability patients do not seem to be clinically useful. These results support the use of a high index of suspicion for performing CTPA to exclude or confirm APE as the most appropriate diagnostic approach in this clinical setting.

At the time of writing Italy is ranking first among countries both in terms of number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and in terms of number of deaths. Such a wide spread of COVID-19 has led to concern among workers who are facing the risk of becoming infected during the execution of their duties. We believe it is useful to remark on the need for professional expertise in the field of Occupational Hygiene in this emergency context, in which the indications provided by national and international bodies, the available scientific literature and the legal provisions are constantly and rapidly evolving. It is of fundamental importance that there is an effective analysis of expert inputs, to provide essential guidance to Health, Safety and Environmental managers and other prevention managers in workplaces. In this regard, not only a constant update of the regulatory framework is needed, but also a development and circulation of operational guidance to all the stakeholders to translate general indications into clear operating procedures and implementation tools to be adopted in the workplaces. We believe that the scientific associations in the field of Occupational Hygiene play a crucial role in guiding and assisting prevention professionals. There is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science communities that can help employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of COVID-19. For this reason, the Italian Association of Industrial Hygienists (AIDII-Associazione Italiana degli Igienisti Industriali) published documents containing operational guidelines to provide correct and constantly updated information for: (i) workers employed in essential activities (with low and medium risk of contagion), (ii) health workers and other workers at high or very high risk of contagion, and (iii) for the correct use and handling of personal protective equipment for workers and for the population in general. It is worth pointing out that the documents produced are not intended to replace those produced by authoritative bodies, but to comply with and complete them by reporting an effective summary and further indications about the measures that should be taken in practice under the light of the Italian legislation. At present, the challenge is to produce scientifically sound knowledge, appropriate tools, and effective methodologies, by coordinating the initiatives of different scientific associations, with the final aim to effectively transfer them to employers and workers.","Spinazzè, Andrea; Cattaneo, Andrea; Cavallo, Domenico M",Ann Work Expo Health,256,26

Because hand-foot syndrome caused by S-1 was prolonged, the dosage was completed in 11 courses. He remains alive 4.5 years after surgery without recurrence. Although ToGA examination showed that trastuzumab was effective for HER 2-positive unresectable gastric cancer, few reported cases showed progression to cCR after the treatment followed by a regimen of trastuzumab without CDDP, and they had good prognosis. Furthermore, in this case, the liver metastases showed complete response without CDDP. Thus, trastuzumab might be a chemotherapy option for patients who have difficulty using platinum analogs, including the elderly patients.","Oae, Sonoko; Shimada, Shoji; Takano, Yojiro; Seki, Junichi; Nakahara, Kenta; Maeda, Chiyo; Takehara, Yusuke; Enami, Yuta; Sawada, Naruhiko; Ishida, Fumio; Kudo, Shinei",Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,256,23

At the time of this study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest globally (7.9 million infections). Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure and heart rate associated with 70 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 42506 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Using only the first eight days of the data, our deep learning model is able to achieve 78.79% accuracy to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients.","Mehrabadi, Milad Asgari; Aqajari, Seyed Amir Hossein; Azimi, Iman; Downs, Charles A; Dutt, Nikil; Rahmani, Amir M",,256,1

These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented COVID-19-related symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in an electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and nonbiomedical domains, and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, it's unclear how useful openly available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19-related concepts. OBJECTIVE: Given an initial lexicon of COVID-19-related terms, this study aims to characterize the returned terms by similarity across various open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to the word embedding source. METHODS: We compared seven openly available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19-related terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an interannotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to detect informative patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such learned synonyms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept among three patient cohorts: pneumonia (n=6410), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=8647), and COVID-19 (n=2397). RESULTS: We observed high pairwise interannotator agreement (Cohen kappa) for symptoms (0.86-0.99), findings (0.93-0.99), and disorders (0.93-0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more synonyms (mean count of 7.2 synonyms) compared to token-based embedding sources (mean counts range from 2.0 to 3.4). Word embedding sources queried using a qualifier term (eg, dry cough or muscle pain) more often returned qualifiers of the similar semantic type (eg, ""dry"" returns consistency qualifiers like ""wet"" and ""runny"") compared to a single term (eg, cough or pain) queries. A higher proportion of patients had documented fever (0.61-0.84), cough (0.41-0.55), shortness of breath (0.40-0.59), and hypoxia (0.51-0.56) retrieved than other clinical features. Terms for dry cough returned a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 (0.07) than the pneumonia (0.05) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (0.03) populations. CONCLUSIONS: Word embeddings are valuable technology for learning related terms, including synonyms. When leveraging openly available word embedding sources, choices made for the construction of the word embeddings can significantly influence the words learned.","Parikh, Soham; Davoudi, Anahita; Yu, Shun; Giraldo, Carolina; Schriver, Emily; Mowery, Danielle",JMIR Med Inform,256,16

There are formal criteria to solidify the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), but patients are encountered who have clinical and electrodiagnostic features of CIDP but do not fulfill diagnostic criteria. These patients are addressed in recent publications. CIDP (and variants) and other forms of immune-mediated neuropathies (multifocal motor neuropathy) are responsive early on to treatment, but long-term factors are less well described, and a number of publications focus on extended consequences. Acute immune neuropathies have been described in the setting of viral illness, and recent publications look at the question as to whether they are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, idiopathic sensory neuropathies are the most common polyneuropathy, and consensus efforts to codify features into subtypes can be used clinically for a more precise diagnosis.","Bromberg, Mark B",J Clin Neuromuscul Dis,256,1

Frequency of COVID-19 and impact of lockdown on treatment compliance in patients with vasculitis are largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients with ANCA-associated and large vessel vasculitis that have been followed-up in our clinic were contacted by phone and a questionnaire containing home isolation status, treatment adherence and history of COVID-19 between March 1st and June 30th, 2020 was applied. RESULTS: The survey was applied to 103 patients (F/M: 59/44, mean age: 53.2±12.5). Thirty-three (32%) patients didn?t attend at least one appointment; 98(95.1%) noted that they spent 3 months in home isolation. Five patients (4.8%) received immunosuppressives irregularly and 3(2.9%) developed symptoms due to undertreatment.

However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. METHODS: Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 201 adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients. Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. RESULTS: Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity was associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29-5.59) p = 0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","Sacco, Vanessa; Rauch, Barbara; Gar, Christina; Haschka, Stefanie; Potzel, Anne L; Kern-Matschilles, Stefanie; Banning, Friederike; Benz, Irina; Meisel, Mandy; Seissler, Jochen; Lechner, Andreas",PLoS One,256,20

This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested). MethodsWe developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infectious virus strains). Under this model, the CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). ResultsThe CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation. InterpretationThe developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies. FundingThe authors received no funding for this work. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prioritized population groups for vaccination based on available scientific evidence, the feasibility of different implementation strategies, and ethical considerations. We searched PubMed using the query ""(((COVID) AND (vaccin*)) AND (model)) AND ((priorit*) OR alloc*)"" up to June 15, 2021, with no date or language restrictions. The search identified 190 articles, of which 15 used predictive models to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine allocation strategies in achieving vaccination campaign goals such as reducing mortality or incidence. All studies compared only a small number of specific, expertise-based allocations. Most studies stratified the population by age, while some considered additional characteristics such as occupation or comorbidity status, but none took into account all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritizations. Added value of this studyWe developed a compartmental disease model that takes into account several important components of the COVID-19 pandemic, and stratifies the U.S. population by all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritization recommendations. In a novel global optimization approach, we compared the CDC recommendations to all potentially optimal strategies (17.5 million strategies) that also stagger the vaccine roll-out in four phases. The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all considered outcome measures, but never optimally; a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes. The CDC decision to initially not vaccinate children, as well as the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers proved optimal under all outcome measures. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study identifies and compares the optimal vaccine allocation strategies for several competing vaccination goals. The developed global optimization approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States and elsewhere.","Islam, Md Rafiul; Oraby, Tamer; McCombs, Audrey; Chowdhury, Mohammad Mihrab; Al-Mamun, Mohammad; Tyshenko, Michael G.; Kadelka, Claus",,256,16

This has created a need for strategies to triage surgical patients. Here, we describe our experience using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) COVID-19 Guidelines for Triage of Vascular Surgery Patients in an academic surgery practice. METHODS: We used the ACS Guidelines as a framework to direct the triage of vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed the results of this triage during the first month of surgical restriction at our hospital. Patients undergoing surgery were identified by reviewing the operating room schedule. We reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each completed surgery. Surgeries that were postponed during that same time period were identified from a prospectively maintained list. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed surgeries and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each surgery. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed procedures to identify adverse events related to the treatment delay. RESULTS: We performed 69 surgeries in 52 patients during the study period. All surgeries were performed to treat emergent, urgent or time-sensitive elective diagnoses. Forty-seven surgeries (68%) were from Tier 3 and 22 (32%) were from Tier 2b. We did not perform any surgeries from Tier 1 or 2a. We postponed surgery in 66 patients during the same time period. Thirty-six (55%) were from Tier 1, 22 (33%) were from Tier 2a, 5 (8%) were from Tier 2b and 3 (5%) could not be assigned a Tier Class. No Tier 3 surgeries were postponed. Three patients (4.5%) experienced an adverse event that could be attributed to the treatment delay. CONCLUSIONS: The ACS Triage Guidelines provided an effective method to decrease vascular surgical volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic without an increase in patient morbidity. The clinical utility of the Guidelines would be strengthened by incorporating the SURGCON/VASCCON threat level alert system.","Sarfati, Mark R; Griffin, Claire L; Kraiss, Larry W; Smith, Brigitte K; Brooke, Benjamin S",J. vasc. surg,256,24

OBJECTIVE: As hyposmia accompanies cognitive impairment in several neurological disorders, we aimed to study whether hyposmia represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild CO-VID-19. We aimed to study whether olfactory dysfunction (OD) represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild COVID-19. METHODS: Formal olfactory testing using the Sniffin'Sticks® Screening test, neuropsychological assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and detailed neurological examination were performed in 7 COVID-19 patients with mild disease course and no history of olfactory or cognitive impairment, and 7 controls matched for age, sex, and education. Controls were initially admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 screening ward but tested negative by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The number of correctly identified odors was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in controls (6 ± 3, vs. 10 ± 1 p = 0.028, r = 0.58). Total MoCA score was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in controls (20 ± 5 vs. 26 ± 3, p = 0.042, r = 0.54). Cognitive performance indicated by MoCA was associated with number of correctly identified odors in COVID-19 patients and controls (COVID-19: p = 0.018, 95% CI = 9-19; controls: p = 0.18, r = 0.63, 95% CI = 13-18.5 r = 0.64). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: OD is associated with cognitive impairment in controls and mild COVID-19. OD may represent a potentially useful clinical biomarker for subtle and even subclinical neurological involvement in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.","Pirker-Kees, Agnes; Platho-Elwischger, Kirsten; Hafner, Sebastian; Redlich, Kurt; Baumgartner, Christoph",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,256,26

Patients and methods: A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results: Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion: Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools. This pilot study suggests a possible role for vocal biomarkers in screening for SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.","Maor, Elad; Tsur, Nir; Barkai, Galia; Meister, Ido; Makmel, Shmuel; Friedman, Eli; Aronovich, Daniel; Mevorach, Dana; Lerman, Amir; Zimlichman, Eyal; Bachar, Gideon",,256,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective monocentric study included consecutive patients before aortic valvular replacement. All patients underwent: i), 1.5T CMR with pre and post contrast T1 mapping sequence and ECV computation; ii), serum quantification of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and iii), myocardial biopsies were collected during surgery to assess collagen volume fraction (CVF). Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. Correlation between native T1, ECV, CVF and serum biomarkers were assessed using Pearson correlation test. Agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV with global ECV was assessed using Bland-Altman test. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, 16 with aortic stenosis and 5 with aortic regurgitation were included. There were 12 men and 9 women with a mean age of 74.1±6.8 (SD) years (range: 32-84 years). Mean global ECV value was 26.7±2.7 (SD) % (range: 23.4-32.5%) and mean CVF value was 12.4±9.7% (range: 3.2-25.7%). ECV assessed at the basal anteroseptal segment correlated moderately with CVF (r=0.6; P=0.0026). There was a strong correlation and agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV and global ECV, (r=0.8; P<0.0001; bias 5.4±6.1%) but no correlation between global ECV and CVF (r=0.5; P=0.10). Global ECV poorly correlated with serum TIMP-1 (r=0.4; P=0.037) and MMP-2 (r=0.4; P=0.047). No correlation was found between serum biomarkers and basal anteroseptal- ECV or native T1. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe aortic valvulopathy, diffuse myocardial fibrosis assessed by anterosepto-basal ECV correlates with histological myocardial fibrosis. Anteroseptobasal ECV strongly correlates with global ECV, which poorly correlates with TIMP-1 and MMP-2, serum biomarkers involved in the progression of heart failure.","Foussier, C; Barral, P A; Jerosh-Herold, M; Gariboldi, V; Rapacchi, S; Gallon, A; Bartoli, A; Bentatou, Z; Guye, M; Bernard, M; Jacquier, A",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,256,24

Multiple analysis included quantile regression, estimating the regression coefficients of the variable income for every five percentiles from the 10th to 90th percentiles to verify the relationship between income and incidence. RESULTS: the city's rate was 36.58 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In general, the highest rates were observed in the wealthiest regions. Multiple analysis was consistent with this observation since the per capita income affected all percentiles analyzed, with a median regression coefficient of 0.02 (p-value <0.001; R2 32.93).

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","Mesquita, Dinis; Carmo, Pedro; Cabanelas, Nuno; Santos, Nuno; Martins, Vítor; Sanfins, Victor; Costa, Helena Cristina; Fontes, José Paulo; Fonseca, Paulo; Parreira, Leonor",Rev. port. cardiol,256,16

The COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictions have necessitated the use of telemedicine in the management of diabetic foot disease (tele-podiatry), particularly of patients classified as low-risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a report of three cases of varied diabetic foot problems assessed during the present pandemic using different forms of telemedicine for triaging, management of low-risk cases and for follow-up. RESULTS: Tele-podiatry was effective in the management of low-risk subjects with diabetic foot ulcer, and also useful in referral of high-risk subjects for hospital/clinic visit, facilitating proper management. It also helped in the follow-up of the cases. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is a good screening tool for diagnosing and managing low-risk subjects with diabetic foot problems, and also enables a triaging system for deciding on hospital visits and hospitalization. Telemedicine offers several benefits in the management of diabetic foot disease, although it also has some limitations. Based on our experience during the pandemic, we recommend its judicious use in the triaging of patients of diabetic foot disease and management of low-risk cases.

Cancer patients are immunosuppressed and very susceptive to acquiring infections; thus, they are at greater risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. People infected with COVID-19 display increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Excessive inflammation may cause damage to the body's tissues, thereby potentially contributing to alveolar damage and the severity of COVID-19. We hypothesize that since a pro-inflammatory state may worsen COVID-19 prognosis, modulating systemic inflammation through dietary modification may be efficacious in improving the clinical sequelae of COVID-19.

The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. RESULTS: No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI: - 4.18 to - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. CONCLUSION: The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics. Further research should investigate the effect of social and psychological factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04169646.

Even with the advent of more advanced telehealth technologies, the implementation of behavioral programming falls mainly on the caregivers of the clients that are served. This crisis brings to light ethical dilemmas and upends the current ways many programs may have been implemented across the world. As a result, a reevaluation of how these services are delivered is in order. This article reviews how a university-based, state-funded service delivery program (USSDP) provided essential and necessary services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the purpose of this article is to describe how the USSDP quickly adopted a telehealth care model in a program that previously had not delivered services in this modality. Ethical, contextual, and competency-based factors are reviewed in the context of this organization, followed by a dialogue on broader generalization suggestions utilizing an active support model of care within telehealth restrictions.","Britwum, Kwadwo; Catrone, Rocco; Smith, G David; Koch, Darwin Shane",Behav Anal Pract,256,30

Intense research efforts are now underway worldwide to combat and prevent the spread of this deadly disease. This zoonotic virus, a native to bat population, is most likely transmitted to a human via a host reservoir. Due to its close similarity to previously known SARS CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) of 2002 and related MERS CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) of 2012, it is also known as SARS CoV2. But unlike them, it is far too infectious, virulent and lethal. Among its various proteins, the surface spike glycoprotein ""S"" has drawn significant attention because of its implication in viral recognition and host-virus fusion process. A detailed comparative analysis of ""S"" proteins of SARS CoV (now called SARS CoV1), SARS CoV2 (COVID-19) and MERS CoV based on structure, sequence alignment, host cleavage sites, receptor binding domains, potential glycosylation and Cys-disulphide bridge locations has been performed.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 11,703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates. RESULTS: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the reported COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population. INTERPRETATION: Our study estimates the overall national serological prevalence of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to be 11%, with an apparent disparity between regions. This indicates the prevalence of asymptomatic or mild unreported COVID-19 cases.","Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Alghnam, Suliman; Algaissi, Abdullah; Albalawi, Hind; Alenazi, Mohammed W; Albargawi, Areeb M; Alharbi, Abdullah G; Alhazmi, Abdulaziz; Al Qarni, Ali; Alfarhan, Ali; Zowawi, Hosam M; Alhatmi, Hind; Alghamdi, Jahad; Alroqi, Fayhan; Batarfi, Khalid; Arabi, Yaseen M; Hashem, Anwar M; Bosaeed, Mohammed; Aldibasi, Omar",J Infect Public Health,256,1

High standards in the design, conduct, and reporting of NHP vaccine studies are crucial for maximizing their scientific value and translation, and for making efficient use of precious resources. A key aspect is consideration of the 3Rs principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement. Funders of NHP research are placing increasing emphasis on the 3Rs, helping to ensure such studies are legitimate, ethical, and high-quality. The UK's National Centre for the 3Rs (NC3Rs) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have collaborated on a range of initiatives to support vaccine developers to implement the 3Rs, including hosting an international workshop in 2019. The workshop identified opportunities to refine NHP vaccine studies to minimize harm and improve welfare, which can yield better quality, more reproducible data. Careful animal selection, social housing, extensive environmental enrichment, training for cooperation with husbandry and procedures, provision of supportive care, and implementation of early humane endpoints are features of contemporary good practice that should and can be adopted more widely.

We wanted to rapidly characterise the transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape of this novel coronavirus to provide a fundamental description of the virus's genomic and proteomic potential. METHODS: We used direct RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells which is widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. Allied to this, we used tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome and phosphoproteome of the same virally infected cells. RESULTS: Our integrated analysis revealed that the viral transcripts (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs) generally fitted the expected transcription model for coronaviruses. Importantly, a 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in over half of the subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. Tandem mass spectrometry identified over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides in virus-infected cells, covering almost all proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein, a leading vaccine target, shows that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. The furin site directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit and likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. Our data emphasises that the viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","Davidson, Andrew D; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Lewis, Sebastian; Shoemark, Deborah; Carroll, Miles W; Heesom, Kate J; Zambon, Maria; Ellis, Joanna; Lewis, Philip A; Hiscox, Julian A; Matthews, David A",Genome Med,256,16

Most transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 occur in households. MethodsUsing individual-level registry data of all Norwegian residents we compared infections across all multi-person households. A household with at least one member born abroad was defined as an immigrant household. For the subset of households where at least one person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from August 1st 2020 to May 1st 2021, we calculated secondary attack rates (SARs) as the percent of other household members testing positive within 14 days after the first household member tested positive. Logistic regression model was used to adjust for sex, age, household composition and geography. ResultsAmong all multi-person households in Norway (n=1 421 642), immigrant households (n=341 604) comprised more members on average (3.2) than households with only Norwegian-born members (2.8). The share of immigrant households where at least one member had been tested, was 56% (vs 49% in the households with only Norwegian-born members), and the share where at least one member was infected was 3.7% (vs 1.4% in households with only Norwegian-born members). Secondary attack rates were higher in immigrant (32%) than Norwegian-born households (20%). Results differed considerably by country of birth, with secondary attack rates particularly high in households from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Pakistan, also after adjustment for sex, age, household composition and geography. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 is more frequently introduced into multi-person immigrant households than into households with only Norwegian-born members, and transmission within the household occurs more frequently in immigrant households. The results are likely related to living conditions, family composition or differences in social interaction, emphasizing the need to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into these vulnerable households.","Methi, Fredrik; Hart, Rannveig Kaldager; Godoy, Anna Aasen; Jorgensen, Silje Bakken; Kacelnik, Oliver; Telle, Kjetil Elias",,256,26

METHODSIn each hospital, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia, were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive: a) standard of care; or b) emtricitabine/tenofovir; or c) colchicine + rosuvastatin; or d) emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within the first 28 days after randomization. Severe adverse events (SAE) were those with a high probability of being treatment-related. RESULTS633 patients were randomized in 6 hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. Overall, 98% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death through day 28 was 10.7% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 14.4% in the colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 13.8% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir arm, and 17.4% in the standard of care arm, with adjusted risk differences (aRD) against the standard treatment of -0.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.17 to 0.04), aRD -0.03 (95%CI: -0.11 to 0.05) and aRD: -0.05 (95%CI: -0.15 to 0.05), respectively.

The stroke team educates on signs and symptoms of stroke, risks factors, and 911 activation. Within a few days of discharge, Neuroscience nurses call stroke patients to ensure patients have obtained their prescription medications, have follow-up appointments, inquire about their satisfaction with our services, and reinforce stroke education. As part of these calls, our team asked why patients/families did not call 911. The purpose of this study was to determine if the COVID-19 crisis influenced the reasons why 911 was not called for possible stroke to better plan for targeted stroke education. Method: Discharge phone survey data from our stroke network was collected from Feb-Jul 2019 and compared to Feb-Jul 2020. Our stroke network includes 1 comprehensive stroke center and 2 primary stroke centers. Emergency Department (ED) stroke activation data was gathered for the same time periods. Discharge phone calls data was based on discharge date, whereas ED stroke alert data was based on admission date. Results: There was a notable decline in stroke volume between 2019 to 2020 with the largest decline occurring during the first peak (Apr 2020) in COVID-19 cases within our state. This decline was driven by a 16% decline in walk-in ED stroke arrivals as compared to a 1% decline in EMS stroke arrivals. Of those who did not call 911 in 2020, there was a 7% increase in failing to recognize stroke symptoms as an emergency, a 6% increase in concern about EMS cost, and 6% decrease in hospital preference. Conclusion: The COVID-19 crisis negatively influenced stroke volumes within our system strokeprogram. Reductions in stroke walk-ins accounted for this decline. COVID-19 affected the reasonswhy 911 was not called. The largest increase was in not recognizing stroke symptoms as anemergency and increased concern about EMS associated costs. Surprisingly, COVID-19 was notlisted as a reasons for avoiding 911. Targeted community educational efforts on these concerns maylead to improved 911 usage for suspected stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ramirez, M.; Bedgio, R.

METHODS: We conducted a multicountry online survey among PWE. Persons with epilepsy were invited to participate through various social media channels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale were used to score anxiety and depression. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate factors associated with anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-nine PWE were included (mean age: 38.22â¯±â¯12.09â¯years), the majority were female (80.2%) and living in high-income countries (83.2%). Two hundred three PWE reported symptoms of a cold since January 2020. Nine (25%) of the 36 PWE tested for COVID were positive. A total of 72 PWE (19.6%) reported problems to obtain antiseizure medication (ASM), which in 25% of cases was directly COVID-related. Of the 399 PWE, 201 (50.4%) screened positive for anxiety according to the HADS; 159 (39.8%) and 187 (46.9%) PWE screened positive for depression based on the HADS and PHQ-9 scale, respectively. Female gender and financial problems were associated with both depression and anxiety. A planned follow-up consultation with the treating physician was associated with a lower risk of depression, whereas difficulties to access ASM treatment increased the odds of depression. In 65/137 (47.4%) PWE with a planned follow-up visit with the treating physician, this consultation was canceled. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative approaches are needed to ensure continuity in access to ASM treatment. Healthcare workers should ensure continued follow-up, either through inperson or telehealth appointments, to timely identify symptoms of anxiety and depression and act accordingly.","Van Hees, Stijn; Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Wijtvliet, Veerle; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Faria de Moura Villela, Edlaine; da Silva, Carolina Ferreira; Weckhuysen, Sarah; Colebunders, Robert",Epilepsy Behav,256,16

About 163,524 active Fitbit users from 6 major US cities contributed data, representing areas particularly hard-hit by the pandemic (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Miami). Sleep variables extracted include nightly and weekly mean sleep duration and bedtime, and variability (standard deviation) of sleep duration and bedtime. Deviation from similar timeframes in 2018 and 2019 were examined, as were changes in these sleep metrics during the pandemic, relationships to changes in resting heart rate, and changes during re-opening in May and June. Overall, compared to 2019, mean sleep duration in 2020 was higher among nearly all groups, mean sleep phase shifted later for nearly all groups, and mean sleep duration and bedtime variability decreased for nearly all groups (owing to decreased weekday-weekend differences). Over the course of January to April 2020, mean sleep duration increased, mean bedtime shifted later, and mean sleep duration variability decreased. Changes in observed resting heart rate correlated positively with changes in sleep and negatively with activity levels. In later months (May and June), many of these changes started to drift back to historical norms.","Rezaei, Naghmeh; Grandner, Michael A",Sleep Health,256,16

Among the triggers of epidemic include urbanization and internal migrations. Within the past few years, there have been DF outbreaks in Tanzania. Although Pwani region is among the predicted risk areas for the DF, there is insufficient data about people's knowledge, attitude and practices towards prevention of DF in their settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude and practices about DF among adults in Pwani region in Tanzania. Methods: The cross-sectional study conducted in Mkuranga District, Pwani region in Tanzania. We used face-to-face interviews to collect data. The main analytical procedure was descriptive using frequencies. Results: The majority, 97.7%, were aware of DF. Nevertheless, almost 80% had a low knowledge on symptoms, transmission and vector control measures. Furthermore, less than 20% had positive attitude towards dengue fever prevention, severity of the illness and health seeking behavior. Conclusion: Lack of enough knowledge and positive attitude about disease transmission, symptoms and preventive measures put the population at high risk of contracting the disease.

METHODS: Individuals receiving services during May 8-18, 2020, from behavioral health programs that had introduced telehealth in March 2020, were invited to participate in a survey regarding their perceptions of the telehealth services. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to test for differences in survey responses in three ways: between program types, between the 2020 sample and a 2018 sample, and between individuals reported by staff to be distressed or not distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of 1,482 survey respondents, >80% reported that their ability to connect to staff, receive support, and get an appointment was at least as great as before the pandemic. Among 80% of respondents indicating interest in continuing remote services after the pandemic ended, 83% preferred a mix of remote and face-to-face services. From February 2020 to April 2020, total service utilization remained stable for treatment, outreach, and housing programs. In addition, mental health-related hospital utilization did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that telehealth, including telephone-based services, is an acceptable and even preferred service delivery mode for clients with severe mental illness. Continued investigation into the optimal dosing of face-to-face versus remote services in various settings is needed to inform service practice during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tse, Jeanie; LaStella, Drew; Chow, Elisa; Kingman, Emily; Pearlman, Shoshannah; Valeri, Linda; Wang, Hao; Dixon, Lisa B",Psychiatr Serv,256,1

While the disease course usually appears mild, severe and critical COVID-19 appears to lead to significant morbidity including ICU admission with prolonged hospital stay, intubation, mechanical ventilation and even death. Although there are recent reports regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, information regarding the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant versus non-pregnant women remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the outcomes of severe and critical COVID-19 infection in pregnant versus non-pregnant reproductive aged women. STUDY DESIGN: This is a multi-center retrospective case-control study of women with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19 in four academic medical centers in NYC and one in Philadelphia between March 12 and May 5, 2020. The cases consist of pregnant women admitted specifically for severe or critical COVID-19 and not for obstetric indication. The controls consist of reproductive aged, non-pregnant women admitted for severe or critical COVID-19. The primary outcome is a composite morbidity including: death, need for intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or need for high flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. Secondary outcomes include ICU admission, length of stay, need for discharge to long term acute care facility and discharge with home oxygen requirement. RESULTS: Thirty-eight pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed infection were admitted to five institutions specifically for COVID-19, 29 (76.3%) meeting criteria for severe disease and 9 (23.7%) meeting criteria for critical disease. The mean age and BMI were significantly higher in the non-pregnant control group. The non-pregnant cohort was also noted to have increased frequency of pre-existing medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Pregnant women were more likely to experience the primary outcome when compared to the non-pregnant control group (34.2% vs. 14.9%, p=0.03, adjusted OR 4.6 [95% CI 1.2-18.2]). Pregnant patients experienced higher rates of ICU admission (39.5% vs. 17.0%, p<0.01, adjusted OR 5.2 [95% CI 1.5-17.5]). Among pregnant women that underwent delivery, 72.7% occurred via cesarean delivery and mean gestational age at delivery was 33.8 ±5.5 weeks in patients with severe disease and 35 ±3.5 weeks in patients with critical COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with severe and/or critical COVID-19 are at increased risk for certain morbidities when compared to non-pregnant controls. Despite the higher comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension in the non-pregnant controls, the pregnant cases were at increased risk for composite morbidity, intubation, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be associated with a worse outcome in women with severe and critical COVID-19. Our study suggests that similar to other viral infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pregnant women may be at risk for greater morbidity and disease severity.","DeBolt, Chelsea A; Bianco, Angela; Limaye, Meghana A; Silverstein, Jenna; Penfield, Christina A; Roman, Ashley S; Rosenberg, Henri M; Ferrara, Lauren; Lambert, Calvin; Khoury, Rasha; Bernstein, Peter S; Burd, Julia; Berghella, Vincenzo; Kaplowitz, Elianna; Overbey, Jessica R; Stone, Joanne",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,256,24

Few studies have documented the relationship between the absence of labour companions and mistreatment of women during childbirth in low-income and middle-income countries using a standardised tool. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO multi-country study on how women are treated during childbirth, where a cross-sectional community survey was conducted with women up to 8 weeks after childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine whether labour companionship was associated with various types of mistreatment. RESULTS: Of 2672 women, about half (50.4%) reported the presence of a labour companion. Approximately half (49.6%) of these women reported that the timing of support was during labour and after childbirth and most of the labour companions (47.0%) were their family members. Across Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, women without a labour companion were more likely to report physical abuse, non-consented medical procedures and poor communication compared with women with a labour companion. However, there were country-level variations. In Guinea, the absence of labour companionship was associated with any physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.6, 1.9-6.9) and non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 3.2, 1.6-6.4). In Ghana, it was associated with non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 2.3, 1.7-3.1) and poor communication (AOR 2.0, 1.3-3.2). In Nigeria, it was associated with longer wait times (AOR 0.6, 0.3-0.9). CONCLUSION: Labour companionship is associated with lower levels of some forms of mistreatment that women experience during childbirth, depending on the setting. Further work is needed to ascertain how best to implement context-specific labour companionship to ensure benefits while maintaining women's choices and autonomy.","Balde, M.

When COVID-19 is severe, it can cause pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and can progress to viremia involving multiple organ systems. It causes significant cytopenia, mainly severe lymphopenia, and excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in an immunocompromised state and cytokine storm. Furthermore, COVID-19 can commonly be complicated with acute thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism, acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, clotting of hemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) catheters, and acute limb ischemia. This makes SARS-COV-2 a unique virus with an undiscovered pathophysiology. Therefore, patients with COVID-19 need close monitoring of their symptoms and laboratory parameters, and early hospitalization and treatment in severe cases.

The survey participants (n=200) completed a daily diary for a week and five weekly longitudinal reports, and 48 participants attended a semi‐structured interview. The quantitative results showed that higher relational catalyst support (i.e., support for growth opportunities) predicted better goal outcomes; qualitative analyses revealed partners use direct and indirect forms of emotional and instrumental support toward goal pursuit.

The next important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. FQHC clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care. Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome. The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0 mmHg difference in systolic BP at a 0.05 significance level and 80% follow-up rate.

By the end of 2005, there were 149 low-standard HCW disposal facilities in operation in China, distributed throughout different areas. According to the National Hazardous Waste and Healthcare Waste Disposal Facility Construction Plan, 331 modern, high-standard, centralized facilities will be built up in China in municipal level cities. Although incineration is still the main technical option for HCW disposal in China, it is expected that, especially for medium and small size facilities, non-incineration technologies will develop quickly and will soon become the main technical option. The basic management needs – both from the point of view of pollution control and final disposal – have been defined, and a system of technical and environmental standards has been formulated and implemented; however, there are still some shortages. This is particularly true when considering the best available techniques and best environmental practices developed under the Stockholm Convention, with which the present technological and managing situations are not completely compliant. In this framework, the lifecycle (from generation to final disposal of wastes) of HCW and holistic approaches (technology verification, facilities operation, environmental supervision, environmental monitoring, training system, financial mechanism, etc.) towards HCW management are the most important criteria for the sustainable and reliable management of HCW in China.","Yang, Chen; Peijun, Li; Lupi, Carlo; Yangzhao, Sun; Diandou, Xu; Qian, Feng; Shasha, Fu",Waste Manag,256,6

However, currently, no studies investigate kidney impairment in children with COVID-19. We investigated incidence and treatment of AKI in pediatric patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan Children’s Hospital during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss possible mechanisms of AKI related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: By extracting data from electronic medical records, we conducted a retrospective observational study of kidney involvement in confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases in Wuhan Children’s Hospital during the coronavirus outbreak, from January 24 to March 20, 2020. Clinical presentations, clinical courses, laboratory findings, and medical interventions are described below. RESULTS: Among 238 confirmed COVID-19 cases, only three were critically ill and needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. All three developed AKI, but AKI was not detected in any non-critically ill patients outside the ICU. Two of the three patients with AKI had prodromal gastrointestinal symptoms. Significantly elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and complement activation were observed in these patients with AKI. The three patients with AKI were treated with plasma exchange (PE) and continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), resulting in one complete recovery, one partial recovery, and one mortality due to critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill children with COVID-19 may develop AKI, especially following prodromal gastrointestinal symptoms. An inflammatory storm and complement-mediated injury may underlie AKI development in children with COVID-19. Our study supports implantation of PE and CKRT in management of critically ill patients with AKI.","Wang, Xiaowen; Chen, Xingfeng; Tang, Feng; Luo, Wanjun; Fang, Jian; Qi, Chang; Sun, Hua; Xiao, Han; Peng, Xuehua; Shao, Jianbo",Pediatr Nephrol,256,16

Harnessing RNA splicing modifiers as a new pharmacological modality is promising for the treatment of diseases caused by aberrant splicing. This drug modality can be used for infectious diseases by disrupting the splicing of essential pathogenic genes. Several antisense oligonucleotide splicing modifiers were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Recently, a small-molecule splicing modifier, risdiplam, was also approved for the treatment of SMA, highlighting small molecules as important warheads in the arsenal for regulating RNA splicing. The cellular targets of these approved drugs are all mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) in human cells. The development of novel RNA-targeting splicing modifiers can not only expand the scope of drug targets to include many previously considered “undruggable” genes but also enrich the chemical-genetic toolbox for basic biomedical research. In this review, we summarized known splicing modifiers, screening methods for novel splicing modifiers, and the chemical space occupied by the small-molecule splicing modifiers.","Tang, Zhichao; Zhao, Junxing; Pearson, Zach J.; Boskovic, Zarko V.; Wang, Jingxin",Molecules,256,20

In this Perspective, we critically evaluate and argue that this is due to a dysregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Previously, we have shown that loss of angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes the ACE/angiotensin-II (Ang-II)/angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, a deleterious arm of RAS, unleashing its detrimental effects in diabetes. As suggested by the recent reports regarding the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), upon entry into the host, this virus binds to the extracellular domain of ACE2 in nasal, lung, and gut epithelial cells through its spike glycoprotein subunit S1. We put forth the hypothesis that during this process, reduced ACE2 could result in clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients with diabetes via aggravating Ang-II–dependent pathways and partly driving not only lung but also bone marrow and gastrointestinal pathology. In addition to systemic RAS, the pathophysiological response of the local RAS within the intestinal epithelium involves mechanisms distinct from that of RAS in the lung; however, both lung and gut are impacted by diabetes-induced bone marrow dysfunction. Careful targeting of the systemic and tissue RAS may optimize clinical outcomes in subjects with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Obukhov, Alexander G.; Stevens, Bruce R.; Prasad, Ram; Li Calzi, Sergio; Boulton, Michael E.; Raizada, Mohan K.; Oudit, Gavin Y.; Grant, Maria B.",Diabetes,256,16

Guided by APSED, Mongolia has established a functional coordination mechanism between the animal and human health sectors. Surveillance, information exchange and risk assessment, risk reduction, and coordinated response capacity and collaborative research have been identified as the four pillars of the zoonoses framework. Intersectoral collaboration has been clearly shown to be a crucial tool in the prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases. A “One Health” strategy has been implemented under the concept of ‘Healthy animal-Healthy food-Healthy people’. An intersectoral coordination mechanism established between the veterinary and public health sectors has expanded its function to incorporate more work on food safety, emergency management, and effects of climate change on zoonotic diseases. Its membership includes the human health sector, the veterinary sector, the national emergency management agency, the environment sector, emergency management and inspection authorities, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The main outputs of the coordination mechanism have been strengthened surveillance and response activities and laboratory capacities. The coordination mechanism has also strengthened the surveillance and response capacity of neglected zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis, anthrax, and tick-borne diseases. Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, both sectors have developed joint operational plans, a long-term risk reduction plan 2011–2015, initiated a prioritization exercise and risk assessment for 29 zoonotic diseases, and reviewed and revised standards, procedures, and communication strategies. In 2011, a list of experts on major zoonoses were identified from different sectors and formed into a taskforce to identify the focal points for rabies, brucellosis, and vector-borne diseases. As a result, disease control strategies are now linked to scientific research and epidemiological expertise.","Batsukh, Zayat; Tsolmon, B.; Otgonbaatar, Dashdavaa; Undraa, Baatar; Dolgorkhand, Adyadorj; Ariuntuya, Ochirpurev",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,256,29
594678,594678,594678,Reply to a letter to the editor,14.955799,6.7718887,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and has caused more than 80 million infections and 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Although it is primarily a respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2 also has extra-pulmonary effects. Pancreatic injury and cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) have been recognized and attributed to SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanisms of pancreatic injury are still a subject of debate. There is also controversy on whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause AP or if it is an epiphenomenon. AIM: To review and to explore the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and AP, and to provide an overview of the existing literature on possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced pancreatic lesion. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for papers on SARS-CoV-2 infection and AP. A narrative review on possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced pancreatic lesion was also performed. RESULTS: A literature review revealed a growing body of evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced pancreatic lesions including the mechanisms of direct virus-mediated injury, systemic inflammatory response and circulating pro-inflammatory interleukins, virus-induced lipotoxicity, and drug-induced injury. A systematic review of the literature revealed 22 cases of AP in COVID-19 patients. However, limitations of the reported cases make it difficult to establish a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and AP. All of the studies agreed on special monitoring and surveillance of this subset of patients due to the still unknown clinical progression, therapeutic implications, and prognosis. CONCLUSION: AP should be considered in COVID-19 patients, especially in those exhibiting abdominal pain and systematic, and complete reporting of these cases should be general practice. However, there is still insufficient evidence showing that COVID-19 can cause AP or negatively impact prognosis. Additional studies are needed to clarify the relationship between these two entities and their theragnostic significance.","Correia de Sá, Tiago; Soares, Carlos; Rocha, Mónica",World J Gastrointest Surg,256,1

We identified 4 major challenges associated with the current modeling paradigm (SEIR) that hinder the efforts to accurately characterize the emerging COVID-19 and future epidemics. These challenges included (1) lack of consistent definition of “case”; (2) discrepancy between patient-level clinical insights and population-level modeling efforts; (3) lack of adequate inclusion of individual behavioral and social influence; and (4) allowing little flexibility of including new evidence and insights when our knowledge evolved rapidly during the pandemic. Therefore, these challenges made the current SEIR modeling paradigm less practical to handle the complex COVID-19 and future pandemics.

This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the molecular epidemiology and recombination of EV-A71 in mainland China during 1987–2017. Phylogenetic tree showed that besides the previously reported subgenotypes A, B5, C0, C2, C3, and C4, a new subgenotype C6 emerged in mainland China. Recombination analysis indicated that C4 EV-A71 was derived from a common ancestor as a “double-recombinant” virus by intertypic recombination between C EV-A71 and CVA4, CVA5, CVA14, and CVA16 strains in P3 region and intratypic recombination between C and B EV-A71 strains in P2 region. The B5 EV-A71 shared high similarity with C EV-A71 in P1 region while it contained an unidentified sequence in P2 and P3 regions with two possible recombination patterns: one occurred between C4 EV-A71 and CVA3, CVA5, CVA6, CVA10, and CVA12 stains with one breakpoint in 3C, and the other occurred between C1, C2, C3, and C5 EV-A71 and CVA4, CVA5, CVA14, and CVA16 strains with two breakpoints in the 2A/2B junction and 3C. The C2 EV-A71 was probably a recombinant virus between C4 EV-A71 and CVA8 strains with two breakpoints located in the 5′UTR and 2A/2B junction. Moreover, an incredible recombination of C6 EV-A71 occurred between C4 and C2 EV-A71 with multiple breakpoints. Thus, continuous studies on EV-A71 genome characteristics are still useful and essential for monitoring emergence of new viruses and preventing HFMD outbreaks.

We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods We included patients with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in 16 hospitals participating in the international CAPACITY-COVID registry between March 1st and August 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke. We calculated the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke and compared risk factors, cardiovascular complications, and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ischemic stroke. Results We included 2147 patients with COVID-19, of whom 586 (27.3%) needed treatment at an intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty-eight patients (1.8%) had an ischemic stroke. Patients with stroke were older, but did not differ in sex or cardiovascular risk factors. Median time between onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of stroke was two weeks. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher among patients who were treated at an ICU (16/586; 2.7% versus 22/1561; 1.4%; p=0.039). Pulmonary embolism was more common in patients with (8/38; 21.1%) than in those without stroke (160/2109; 7.6%; adjusted RR: 2.08; 95%CI:1.52-2.84). Twenty-seven patients with ischemic stroke (71.1%) died during admission or were functional dependent at discharge and in-hospital mortality. Patients with ischemic stroke were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted RR 1.56; 95%CI:1.13-2.15) than patients without stroke. Conclusions In this multicenter cohort study, the cumulative incidence of acute ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was approximately 2%, with a higher risk in patients treated at an ICU.

METHODS: We analyzed various factors that triggered the health disparity in the United States of America along with the rate of COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we have also focused on the State of Mississippi, which is suffering from an extreme health disparity. Data have been obtained from publicly available data sources including, Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Mississippi State Department of Health. Correlation analysis of the dataset has been performed using R software. RESULTS: Our analysis suggested that the COVID‐19 infection rate per 100 000 people is directly correlated with the increasing number of the African American population in the United States. We have found a strong correlation between the obesity and the COVID‐19 cases as well. All the counties in Mississippi demonstrate a strong correlation between a higher number of African American population to COVID‐19 cases and obesity. Our data also indicate that a higher number of African American populations are facing socioeconomic disadvantages, which enhance their chances of becoming vulnerable to pre‐existing ailments such as obesity, type‐2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS Of the 398 survey recipients, 144 responded (36%). Even if the match process were not limited by COVID-19, 39% of applicants thought interviews should remain in virtual format, 23% said ""no,"" and 30% said ""not sure."" Nearly all applicants (97%) thought all interview offers should be released on the same day. Regarding the early match, 84% thought this should remain. When asked what factors had the most impact on rank lists, faculty and resident interviews were overwhelmingly favored. Open houses and resident ""happy hours"" were less important. Most applicants agreed that the faculty and resident interviews and informational talks were adequately replicated on the virtual platform.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China—and a specific city within China through references to the “Wuhan pneumonia”—potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized. Understanding the nomenclature and biased terms employed in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak is paramount. We propose solidarity with communication professionals in combating the COVID-19 outbreak and the infodemic. Finding solutions to curb the spread of virus bias, stigma, and discrimination is imperative.","Chang, Angela; Schulz, Peter Johannes; Tu, ShengTsung; Liu, Matthew Tingchi",J Med Internet Res,256,26

Working on behalf of NHS England we created OpenSAFELY: a secure health analytics platform covering 40% of all patients in England, holding patient data within the existing data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19 related deaths. COVID-19 related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.59, 95%CI 1.53-1.65); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared to people with white ethnicity, black and South Asian people were at higher risk even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48, 1.29-1.69 and 1.45, 1.32-1.58 respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for COVID-19 related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date.

METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed a protocol for the use of the Ceribell EEG. The staff deploying the device, the attending physician, and the interpreting neurologist completed evaluation tools for each patient. Data maintained for quality and resource planning of 18‐channel electroencephalography ordered for suspected SE were used as controls. Times to diagnosis were compared by application of Welch‐Satterthwaite tests and workforce call‐in demands by Fisher's exact t test. We evaluated qualitative data related to the use of the EEG in COVID‐19 isolation rooms and on its technical aspects and acceptance by staff members. RESULTS: The Ceribell EEG reduced diagnosis time (P = .0000006) and on‐call workforce demand (P = .02). The device can be used at any time of day in any hospital care area and has advantages in respiratory isolation rooms. SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with a standard 18‐channel EEG, the Ceribell device allowed earlier diagnosis of SE and non‐SE conditions and reduced workforce demands. Due to the ease of its use and its simple components, which can be readily disinfected, it is advantageous for COVID‐19 patients in isolation.","LaMonte, Marian P.",Epilepsia Open,256,28

Researchers are now forced to look for resources to cope with negative experiences linked to this health emergency. According to the salutogenic approach proposed by Antonovsky, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a major source of resilience. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the role of SOC in moderating the link between illness experiences (in terms of knowing persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and fear of contracting COVID-19) and psychological well-being. 2,784 participants, taken from a large sample of the Italian population (65.4% females) and aged between 18 and 85 years, filled in an anonymous online survey during the 3rd week of the lockdown. Findings supported the moderating role of SOC in shaping the link between illness experiences and psychological well-being. Specifically, participants who knew at least one person diagnosed with COVID-19 showed lower levels of psychological well-being at low levels of SOC. The negative relation between participants’ fear of contracting COVID-19 and psychological well-being was stronger for those who showed higher levels of SOC. This study discusses the implications of these results for interventions aimed at reducing the pandemic’s detrimental effects and promoting resilience.","Barni, Daniela; Danioni, Francesca; Canzi, Elena; Ferrari, Laura; Ranieri, Sonia; Lanz, Margherita; Iafrate, Raffaella; Regalia, Camillo; Rosnati, Rosa",Front Psychol,256,24

Sensitive and accurate bioanalytical methods are required to characterize NHC and NHCtp pharmacokinetics in clinical trials. Human K(2)EDTA plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysate were spiked with NHC (plasma) or NHCtp (PBMC), respectively. Following the addition of isotopically-labeled internal standards and sample extraction via protein precipitation or lysate dilution, respectively, samples were subjected to liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Methods were validated in accordance with FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation recommendations. NHC can be quantified in plasma with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL; the primary linearity of the assay is 1-5000 ng/mL. Assay precision and accuracy were ≤ 6.40% and ≤ ± 6.37%, respectively. NHC is unstable in whole blood and has limited stability in plasma at room temperature. The calibration range for NHCtp is 1-1500 pmol/sample, and the assay has an LLOQ of 1 pmol/sample. Assay precision and accuracy were ≤ 11.8% and ≤± 11.2%. Ion suppression was observed for both analytes; isotopically labeled internal standards showed comparable ion suppression, resulting in negligible (<5%) relative matrix effects.

Phase II - To determine the efficacy and safety of each candidate entered into the platform, compared to the current Standard of Care (SoC), and recommend whether it should be evaluated further in a later phase II & III platforms. TRIAL DESIGN: AGILE-ACCORD is a Bayesian multicentre, multi-arm, multi-dose, multi-stage open-label, adaptive, seamless phase I/II randomised platform trial to determine the optimal dose, activity and safety of multiple candidate agents for the treatment of COVID-19. Designed as a master protocol with each candidate being evaluated within its own sub-protocol (Candidate Specific Trial (CST) protocol), randomising between candidate and SoC with 2:1 allocation in favour of the candidate (N.B the first candidate has gone through regulatory approval and is expected to open to recruitment early summer 2020). Each dose will be assessed for safety sequentially in cohorts of 6 patients. Once a phase II dose has been identified we will assess efficacy by seamlessly expanding into a larger cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Patient populations can vary between CSTs, but the main eligibility criteria include adult patients (≥18 years) who have laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We will include both severe and mild-moderate patients defined as follows: Group A (severe disease) - patients with WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 infection 9-point ordinal scale of Grades 4 (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs), 5 (hospitalised, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen), 6 (hospitalised, intubation and mechanical ventilation) or 7 (hospitalised, ventilation and additional organ support); Group B (mild-moderate disease) - ambulant or hospitalised patients with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) >94% RA. If any CSTs are included in the community setting, the CST protocol will clarify whether patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection are also eligible. Participants will be recruited from England, North Ireland, Wales and Scotland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Comparator is the current standard of care (SoC), in some CSTs plus placebo. Candidates that prevent uncontrolled cytokine release, prevention of viral replication, and other anti-viral treatment strategies are at various stages of development for inclusion into AGILE-ACCORD. Other CSTs will be added over time. There is not a set limit on the number of CSTs we can include within the AGILE-ACCORD Master protocol and we will upload each CST into this publication as each opens to recruitment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Phase I: Dose limiting toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5 Grade ≥3 adverse events. Phase II: Agreed on a CST basis depending on mechanism of action of the candidate and patient population. But may include; time to clinical improvement of at least 2 points on the WHO 9-point category ordinal scale [measured up to 29 days from randomisation], progression of disease (oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) <92%) or hospitalization or death, or change in time-weighted viral load [measured up to 29 days from randomisation]. RANDOMISATION: Varies with CST, but default is 2:1 allocation in favour of the candidate to maximise early safety data. BLINDING (MASKING): For the safety phase open-label although for some CSTs may include placebo or SoC for the efficacy phase. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Varies between CSTs. However simulations have shown that around 16 participants are necessary to determine futility or promise of a candidate at a given dose (in efficacy evaluation alone) and between 32 and 40 participants are required across the dose-finding and efficacy evaluation when capping the maximum number of participants contributing to the evaluation of a treatment at 40.

INTRODUCTION: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is largely offered for symptomatic relief. The ORBIT registry has shown that patients with a higher EHRA class and lower quality of life (QoL) scores (AFEQT score <65.7) are more likely to suffer emergency hospital admissions. To help prevent unplanned AF admissions and to best utilise the reduced capacity for elective work during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become even more important to prioritise the most symptomatic AF patients for ablation. Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of a subjective symptom-based clinician prioritisation schema compared to objective patient-completed quality of life (QoL) scores. Methods: In July 2020, all elective cases awaiting AF ablation at our institution were categorised by their cardiologist as either category 1 (C1-urgent), category 2 (C2–priority, procedure to be done during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) or category 3 (C3–routine, procedure may be delayed until post pandemic). This categorisation was based on review of clinic letters where EHRA AF symptom class or PROMS are not routinely recorded. All patients in C2 and C3 were then posted an AF specific (AFEQT) and a generic (EQ5D) QoL questionnaire to complete. Physicians were blinded to patient responses on the QoL questionnaires. Results: Details of physician prioritisation and completed questionnaires were available for 85 patients (62 ± 10 years, PAF in 61%, males 66%). The 18 patients that had been categorised in C2 (priority) group were found to have a significantly lower AFEQT score (30.4, IQR 17.2-51.9) compared to the 67 patients classed in C3 (routine) group (56.5, IQR 32.1-74.1; p < 0.01)(Figure 1a). EQ5D scores also tended to be lower in the C2 patients (0.7, IQR 0.4-0.8) compared to C3 (0.8, IQR 0.6-0.9; p = 0.056) (Figure 1c). 16 (89%) patients in C2 had significant AF-related impact on QoL (as defined as AFEQT score <65.7) compared to 42 (63%) of patients in C3. However, there was significant overlap between groups (Figure 1b). 4 patients in C3 had unplanned AF related hospital admissions while awaiting ablation, as compared to none in C2. The median AFEQT score of these 4 patients was 23.3, indicating that they were highly symptomatic despite being classified in C3 by their cardiologist. Conclusion : Physician assessments are moderately accurate in prioritising patients awaiting AF ablation. The addition of formal patient-completed QoL assessment such as with AFEQT, helps to identify the most symptomatic patients at risk of emergency hospital admission, and physicians should consider using these as part of routine assessment, especially during the COVID pandemic.","Pius, C; Ahmad, H; Snowdon, R; Ashrafi, R; Waktare, J; Borbas, Z; Luther, V; Mahida, S; Modi, S; Hall, M; Gupta, D; Todd, D",Europace,256,27

We trained the model using data from Wuhan and applied it to other countries. We show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early. Having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset. The importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65% with a 7-day delay. Furthermore, prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate, rather than strict, transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity, and would likely result in a high ratio (21% ~ 84%) of the population being infected but not treated.

Here we test the ability of DNA aptamers to interact with the spike (S-)protein of the SARS-CoV-2 viral capsid. The S-protein, a trimer made up of several subdomains, develops the crucial function of recognizing the ACE2 receptors on the surface of human cells, and subsequent fusioning of the virus membrane with the host cell membrane. In order to achieve this, the S1 domain of one protomer switches between a closed conformation, in which the binding site is inaccessible to the cell receptors, and an open conformation, in which ACE2 can bind, thereby initiating the entry process of the viral genetic material in the host cell. Here we show, by means of state-of-the-art molecular simulations, that small DNA aptamers experimentally identified can recognize the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, and characterize the details of the binding process. We find that their interaction with different subdomains of the S-protein can effectively block, or at least considerably slow down the opening process of the S1 domain, thereby significantly reducing the probability of virus-cell binding. We provide evidence that, as a consequence, binding of the human ACE2 receptor may be crucially affected under such conditions. Given the facility and low cost of fabrication of specific aptamers, the present findings could open the way to both an innovative viral screening technique with sub-nanomolar sensitivity, and to an effective and low impact curative strategy.","Cleri, Fabrizio; Lensink , Marc F.; Blossey, Ralf",Front Mol Biosci,256,16

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a worldwide threat that has already caused more than 3 000 000 deaths. It is characterized by different patterns of disease evolution depending on host factors among which old-age and pre-existing comorbidities play a detrimental role. Previous coronavirus epidemics, notably SARS-CoV, were associated with increased serum neopterin levels, which can be interpreted as a sign of acute innate immunity in response to viral infection. Here we hypothesize that neopterin may serve as a biomarker of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and Covid-19 disease severity. METHODS: We measured neopterin blood levels by ELISA. Seric concentration was quantified from 256 healthy donors and 374 Covid-19 patients at hospital admission. Enrolled Covid-19 patients were all symptomatic and displayed a large spectrum of comorbidities. Patients were followed until disease resolution or death. RESULTS: Severe and critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were characterized by a profound exacerbation of immune activation characterized by elevated neopterin blood levels. Systemic neopterin levels above 19nM stratified healthy individuals from Covid-19 patients with 87% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, systemic neopterin levels above 53nM differentiated non-survivors from survivors with 64% specificity and 100% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: We propose that neopterin concentration measured at arrival to hospital is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and identifies a high-risk population of pernicious clinical outcome with a need for special medical care.","Chauvin, Manon; Larsen, Martin; Quirant, Bibiana; Quentric, Paul; Dorgham, Karim; Royer, Luca; Vallet, Hélène; Guihot, Amelie; Combadière, Béhazine; Combadière, Christophe; Barallat, Jaume; Mayaux, Julien; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Mathian, Alexis; Amoura, Zahir; Boddaert, Jacques; Armestar, Fernando; Gorochov, Guy; Martinez-Caceres, Eva; Sauce, Delphine",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,256,16

ZIKV is a vector borne Flavivirus that is spread by mosquitoes and it mainly infects neuronal progenitor cells. One hallmark of congenital ZIKV disease is a reduced brain size in fetuses, leading to severe neurological defects. The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging the development of new antiviral treatments against ZIKV, as there are no efficient countermeasures against ZIKV disease. Previously, we presented a new class of host-targeting antivirals active against a number of pathogenic RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show the transfer of the image-based phenotypic antiviral assay to ZIKV-infected brain cells, followed by mechanism-of-action studies and a proof-of-concept study in a three-dimensional (3D) organoid model. The novel antiviral compounds showed a therapeutic window against ZIKV in several cell models and rescued ZIKV-induced neurotoxicity in brain organoids. The compound’s mechanism-of-action was pinpointed to late steps in the virus life cycle, impairing the formation of new virus particles. Collectively, in this study, we expand the antiviral activity of new small molecule inhibitors to a new virus class of Flaviviruses, but also uncover compounds’ mechanism of action, which are important for the further development of antivirals.","Pettke, Aleksandra; Tampere, Marianna; Pronk, Robin; Wallner, Olov; Falk, Anna; Warpman Berglund, Ulrika; Helleday, Thomas; Mirazimi, Ali; Puumalainen, Marjo-Riitta",Viruses,256,20

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. Our objective is to describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution after infection. A cross-sectional study of 704 healthcare workers with a RT–PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 2020 February 28 and 2020 June 14 was conducted 3–7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Outcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. Among the 704 participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years, and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities was reported by 81.3%, 81.5%, and 48.0%, respectively. Three to 7 months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9%, and 23.3%, respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. These data suggest a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3–7 months after their infection, but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities have improved.","Bussière, Nicholas; Mei, Jie; Lévesque-Boissonneault, Cindy; Blais, Mathieu; Carazo, Sara; Gros-Louis, Francois; De Serres, Gaston; Dupré, Nicolas; Frasnelli, Johannes",Chem Senses,256,16

Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms. He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission. He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography. The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml. Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis. After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL. Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%. The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the potential predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and three electronic Chinese databases were searched from December 1, 2019 to April 29, 2020. Eligible studies reporting potential predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 were identified. Unadjusted prognostic effect estimates were pooled using the random-effects model if data from at least two studies were available. Adjusted prognostic effect estimates were presented by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-six observational studies were identified, of which 27 were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 106 potential risk factors were tested, and the following important predictors were associated with mortality: advanced age, male sex, current smoking status, preexisting comorbidities (especially chronic kidney, respiratory, and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases), symptoms of dyspnea, complications during hospitalization, corticosteroid therapy and a severe condition. Additionally, a series of abnormal laboratory biomarkers of hematologic parameters, hepatorenal function, inflammation, coagulation, and cardiovascular injury were also associated with fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: We identified predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19. These findings could help healthcare providers take appropriate measures and improve clinical outcomes in such patients.

Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the ‘art of the possible’, which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for ‘good practice’ for the development and the use of predictive models.","Woolhouse, Mark",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,256,5

To combat this pandemic, different strategies need to be tailored and implemented in countries with different situations. First, in countries with an ongoing explosion of the outbreak (i.e. the USA, Spain, and Italy), strategies suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) which have been proven useful in China should be adopted for implementation. Secondly, countries in the regions that are still at the early stages of the outbreak (i.e., the Africa region, where many countries have only found imported cases) should further strengthen travel restrictions to reduce the risk of imported cases as well as the risk of developing local transmission. Furthermore, countries that have achieved great success in COVID control (i.e. China, South Korea, and Singapore) should continue implement the successful strategies and further roll-out strengthened new strategies to prevent new imported cases. In addition, surveillance on the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 is in need in all countries as some studies have found multiple mutants of SARS-CoV-2, although the impact of the mutation on the infectivity and lethality of the virus was still unclear.","Liao, Huipeng; Zhang, Lei; Marley, Gifty; Tang, Weiming",The Innovation,256,28

Using phylogenetics and “high order genomic structures” including trimer spectrums, codon usage and dinucleotide suppression, we observed distinct clustering of all human coronaviruses that formed phylogenetic clades with their closest animal relatives, indicating they have encompassed long evolutionary histories within specific ecological niches before jumping species barrier to infect humans. The close relationships between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 imply similar evolutionary origin. However, a lower Effective Codon Number (ENC) pattern and CpG dinucleotide suppression in SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may imply a better host fitness, and thus their success in sustaining a pandemic.

Due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in G. uralensis, is currently unclear. Identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound. RESULTS: We used the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value ≤ 1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality EST database for G. uralensis. Based on the EST analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, were found. With the assistance of organ-specific expression pattern analysis, 3 unigenes encoding cytochrome P450s and 6 unigenes encoding glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis.","Li, Ying; Luo, Hong-Mei; Sun, Chao; Song, Jing-Yuan; Sun, Yong-Zhen; Wu, Qiong; Wang, Ning; Yao, Hui; Steinmetz, André; Chen, Shi-Lin",BMC Genomics,256,33

Although there are many predictors of death for CAP, there are still some limitations. This study aimed to build a simple and accurate model based on available and common clinical-related feature variables for predicting CAP mortality by adopting machine learning techniques. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study. The data used in this study were collected from all patients (≥18 years) with CAP admitted to research hospitals between January 2012 and April 2020. Each patient had 62 clinical-related features, including clinical diagnostic and treatment features. Patients were divided into two endpoints, and by using Tensorflow2.4.1 as the modeling framework, a three-layer fully connected neural network (FCNN) was built as a base model for classification. For a comprehensive comparison, seven classical machine learning methods and their integrated stacking patterns were introduced to model and compare the same training and test data. RESULTS: A total of 3997 patients with CAP were included; 205 (5.12%) died in the hospital. After performing deep learning methods, this study established an ensemble FCNN model based on 12 FCNNs. By comparing with seven classical machine learning methods, the area under the curve of the ensemble FCNN was 0.975 when using deep learning algorithms to classify poor from good prognosis based on available and common clinical-related feature variables. The predicted outcome was poor prognosis if the ControlNet’s poor prognosis score was greater than the cutoff value of 0.50. To confirm the scientificity of the ensemble FCNN model, this study analyzed the weight of random forest features and found that mainstream prognostic features still held weight, although the model is perfect after integrating other factors considered less important by previous studies. CONCLUSION: This study used deep learning algorithms to classify prognosis based on available and common clinical-related feature variables in patients with CAP with high accuracy and good generalizability. Every clinical-related feature is important to the model.","Feng, Ding-Yun; Ren, Yong; Zhou, Mi; Zou, Xiao-Ling; Wu, Wen-Bin; Yang, Hai-Ling; Zhou, Yu-Qi; Zhang, Tian-Tuo",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,256,16

RESEARCH DESIGN: This methodological study used non-experimental, cross-sectional exploratory design. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: A total of 559 nurses from two hospitals in Flanders, Belgium, completed the Dutch-language version of the Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Good scientific inquiry guidelines were followed throughout the study. Permission to translate the Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale was obtained from the copyright holder, and the ethical approval and permissions to conduct the study were obtained from the participating university and hospitals, respectively. FINDINGS: The four-component 21-item, Dutch-language version of the Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale proved to be valid and reliable as the original Finnish Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale. The scale’s internal consistency reliability was high (0.91) corresponding with the original Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale validation study (0.93). The principal component analysis confirmed the four-component structure of the original Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale to be valid also in the Belgian data explaining 58.1% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis based on goodness-of-fit indices provided evidence of the scale’s construct validity.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The Dutch-language version of the Nurses’ Moral Courage Scale is a reliable and valid instrument to measure nurses’ self-assessed moral courage in speciality care nursing environments. Further validation studies in other countries, languages and nurse samples representing different healthcare environments would provide additional evidence of the scale’s validity and initiatives for its further development.","Numminen, Olivia; Konings, Kasper; Claerhout, Roelant; Gastmans, Chris; Katajisto, Jouko; Leino-Kilpi, Helena; de Casterlé, Bernadette Dierckx",Nurs Ethics,256,1

It has been known that pulmonary function is affected by COVID-19 during infection and mid-to-long term. However, there is inadequate evidence about extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate extrapulmonary features in post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out after at least 12 weeks from the COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was defined using criteria for clinical severity of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The peripheral muscle strength was measured using the dynamometer. Physical performance was assessed with five times sit-to-stand and 4-m gait speed. Physical activity level (PAL), mood, and sleep quality were assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants with post-COVID-19 (39.2 ± 7.9 years, 54.2% women) were included in the study. Handgrip and quadriceps weakness was observed in 39.6% and 35.4% of the participants, respectively. PAL was low in 39.6%, moderate in 33.3%, and high in 27.1% of the participants. Anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality were observed in 33.3%, 29.2%, and 50% of the participants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapulmonary features are adversely affected in a substantial proportion of post-COVID-19 patients who recovered from mild and moderate disease severity in the mid-term. Comprehensive assessment and appropriate intervention strategies should also be considered for non-severe post-COVID-19 patients.","Tanriverdi, Aylin; Savci, Sema; Kahraman, Buse Ozcan; Ozpelit, Ebru",Ir J Med Sci,256,1

Numerous studies have been conducted to develop membrane filters that have antibacterial properties to solve this problem. Without proper protective filter equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. A combination of nanotechnology and biosorption is expected to offer a new and greener approach to improve the usefulness of polysaccharides as an advanced membrane filtration material. Nanocellulose is among the emerging materials of this century and several studies have proven its use in filtering microbes. Its high specific surface area enables the adsorption of various microbial species, and its innate porosity can separate various molecules and retain microbial objects. Besides this, the presence of an abundant OH groups in nanocellulose grants its unique surface modification, which can increase its filtration efficiency through the formation of affinity interactions toward microbes. In this review, an update of the most relevant uses of nanocellulose as a new class of membrane filters against microbes is outlined. Key advancements in surface modifications of nanocellulose to enhance its rejection mechanism are also critically discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on the development of nanocellulose as a membrane filter against microbes.","Norrrahim, Mohd Nor Faiz; Mohd Kasim, Noor Azilah; Knight, Victor Feizal; Ong, Keat Khim; Mohd Noor, Siti Aminah; Abdul Halim, Norhana; Ahmad Shah, Noor Aisyah; Jamal, Siti Hasnawati; Janudin, Nurjahirah; Misenan, Muhammad Syukri Mohamad; Ahmad, Muhammad Zamharir; Yaacob, Mohd Hanif; Wan Yunus, Wan Md Zin",Polymers (Basel),256,1

The PRV genome is large and difficult to manipulate, but it is feasible to use clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology. However, identification of single guide RNA (sgRNA) through screening is critical to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and is traditionally time and labor intensive, and not suitable for rapid and high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs. In this study, we developed a recombinant PRV strain expressing firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter virus for PRV-specific sgRNA screens and rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds. Luciferase activity was apparent as soon as 4 h after infection and was stably expressed through 10 passages. In a proof of the principle screen, we were able to identify several PRV specific sgRNAs and confirmed that they inhibited PRV replication using traditional methods. Using the reporter virus, we also identified PRV variants lacking US3, US2, and US9 gene function, and showed anti-PRV activity for chloroquine. Our results suggest that the reporter PRV strain will be a useful tool for basic virology studies, and for developing PRV control and prevention measures.","Tang, Yan-Dong; Liu, Ji-Ting; Fang, Qiong-Qiong; Wang, Tong-Yun; Sun, Ming-Xia; An, Tong-Qing; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Cai, Xue-Hui",Viruses,256,12

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","Maslov, Sergei; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,256,30

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 (n = 280) among K-12 students at a research school in North Central Florida. Bivariate analysis and logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of indicators of anxiety-related, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)-related symptoms. Outcomes (anxiety, OCD, and depressive related symptoms) were measured by indices generated based on reported symptoms associated with each psychosocial outcome. RESULTS: Loss of household income was associated with increased risk for all three index-based outcomes: depressive symptoms [aOR = 3.130, 95% CI = (1.41–6.97)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 2.531, 95%CI = (1.154–5.551)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 2.90, 95%CI = (1.32–6.36)]. Being female was associated with being at higher risk for depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.72, 95% CI = (1.02–2.93)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = (1.04–2.97)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 1.764, 95%CI = (1.027–3.028)]. Parental practices protective against COVID-19 were associated with children being at higher risk of depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = (1.04–2.31)]. Lower school level was associated with children being at higher risk of anxiety-related and OCD-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, schools should prioritize mental health interventions that target younger, female students, and children of families with income loss. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 through school closure may exacerbate negative psychosocial health outcomes in children, thus school administrators should move quickly to target those at greatest risk.

Currently there is no human vaccine against Lyme borreliosis, and most research focuses on recombinant protein vaccines. DNA tattoo vaccination with B. afzelii strain PKo OspC in mice has proven to be fully protective against B. afzelii syringe challenge and induces a favorable humoral immunity compared to recombinant protein vaccination. Alternatively, several recombinant protein vaccines based on tick proteins have shown promising effect in tick-bite infection models. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of DNA vaccines against Borrelia OspC or tick antigens in a tick-bite infection model. METHOD: We vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with OspC using a codon-optimized DNA vaccine or with recombinant protein. We challenged these mice with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss)-infected Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Subsequently, we vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with DNA vaccines coding for tick proteins for which recombinant protein vaccines have previously resulted in interference with tick feeding and/or Borrelia transmission: Salp15, tHRF, TSLPI, and Tix-5. These mice were also challenged with B. burgdorferi ss infected Ixodes scapularis nymphs. RESULTS: DNA tattoo and recombinant OspC vaccination both induced total IgG responses. Borrelia cultures and DNA loads of skin and bladder remained negative in the mice vaccinated with OspC DNA vaccination, except for one culture. DNA vaccines against tick antigens Salp15 and Tix-5 induced IgG responses, while those against tHRF and TSLPI barely induced any IgG response. In addition, Borrelia cultures, and DNA loads from mice tattooed with DNA vaccines against tick proteins TSLPI, Salp15, tHRF, and Tix-5 were all positive. CONCLUSION: A DNA tattoo vaccine against OspC induced high specific IgG titers and provided near total protection against B. burgdorferi ss infection by tick challenge. In contrast, DNA tattoo vaccines against tick proteins TSLPI, Salp15, tHRF, and Tix-5 induced low to moderate IgG titers and did not provide protection. Therefore, DNA tattoo vaccination does not seem a suitable vaccine strategy to identify, or screen for, tick antigens for anti-tick vaccines. However, DNA tattoo vaccination is a straightforward and effective vaccination platform to assess novel B. burgdorferi sl antigen candidates in a relevant tick challenge model.","Klouwens, Michelle J.; Trentelman, Jos J.

Whether this is a class effect, or if anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] level influences serological responses, remains unknown. METHODS: Seroprevalence and the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody responses were measured in surplus serum from 11 422 (53.3% [6084] male; median age 36.8 years) patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, stored at six therapeutic drug monitoring laboratories between January 29 and September 30, 2020. Data were linked to nationally held SARS-CoV-2 PCR results to July 11, 2021. RESULTS: Rates of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar across treatment groups. Seroprevalence rates were lower in infliximab- and adalimumab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (infliximab: 3.0% [178/5893], adalimumab: 3.0% [152/5074], vedolizumab: 6.7% [25/375], p = 0.003). The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was similar in infliximab- vs adalimumab-treated patients (median 4.30 cut-off index [COI] [1.94–9.96] vs 5.02 [2.18–18.70], p = 0.164), but higher in vedolizumab-treated patients (median 21.60 COI [4.39–68.10, p < 0.004). Compared to patients with detectable infliximab and adalimumab drug levels, patients with undetectable drug levels [<0.8 mg/L] were more likely to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One-third of patients who had PCR testing prior to antibody testing failed to seroconvert, all were treated with anti-TNF. Subsequent positive PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was seen in 7.9% [12/152] of patients after a median time of 183.5 days [129.8–235.3], without differences between drugs. CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF treatment is associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid seroprevalence and antibody reactivity when compared to vedolizumab-treated patients. Higher seropositivity rates in patients with undetectable anti-TNF levels support a causal relationship, although confounding factors, such as combination therapy with a immunomodulator, may have influenced the results.","Chanchlani, Neil; Lin, Simeng; Chee, Desmond; Hamilton, Benjamin; Nice, Rachel; Arkir, Zehra; Bewshea, Claire; Cipriano, Bessie; Derikx, Lauranne A A P; Dunlop, Allan; Greathead, Louise; Griffiths, Rachel L; Ibraheim, Hajir; Kelleher, Peter; Kok, Klaartje B; Lees, Charlie W; MacDonald, Jonathan; Sebastian, Shaji; Smith, Philip J; McDonald, Timothy J; Irving, Peter M; Powell, Nick; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Goodhand, James R; Ahmad, Tariq",J Crohns Colitis,256,29

In the last quarter of the 18th century, the history of vaccination began, becoming an effective tool to prevent and control communicable diseases. This paper proposes an observational research with a cross-sectional design to study the importance of health education and vaccination in building inclusive societies. With a sample of 1000 participants from 76 countries, vaccine awareness and regulation were analyzed, considering the following variables: gender, age, sector, Human Development Index (HDI), and continent. The instrument used was a questionnaire (VACUNASEDUCA) developed for this research and timely validated. As a result, it is highlighted that the profiles of women, people under 30 years of age, education sector, high Human Development Index, and European continent are those that most value the importance of raising awareness in society and the regulation of actions for vaccination compliance. The consequences of “vaccine reluctance” are of concern in every country on the planet. Therefore, it is concluded that effective and evidence-based communication is key to allaying fears and promoting acceptance of vaccination around the world, building inclusive societies in which all citizens enjoy the health benefits.","García-Toledano, Eduardo; Palomares-Ruiz, Ascensión; Cebrián-Martínez, Antonio; López-Parra, Emilio",Vaccines (Basel),256,1

This obesity paradox is predominantly described in reports from the Western Hemisphere during acute illnesses. Since adipose triglyceride composition corresponds to long-term dietary patterns, we performed a meta-analysis modeling the effect of obesity on severity of acute pancreatitis, in the context of dietary patterns of the countries from which the studies originated. Increased severity was noted in leaner populations with a higher proportion of unsaturated fat intake. In mice, greater hydrolysis of unsaturated visceral triglyceride caused worse organ failure during pancreatitis, even when the mice were leaner than those having saturated triglyceride. Saturation interfered with triglyceride’s interaction and lipolysis by pancreatic triglyceride lipase, which mediates organ failure. Unsaturation increased fatty acid monomers in vivo and aqueous media, resulting in greater lipotoxic cellular responses and organ failure. Therefore, visceral triglyceride saturation reduces the ensuing lipotoxicity despite higher adiposity, thus explaining the obesity paradox.","Khatua, Biswajit; El-Kurdi, Bara; Patel, Krutika; Rood, Christopher; Noel, Pawan; Crowell, Michael; Yaron, Jordan R.; Kostenko, Sergiy; Guerra, Andre; Faigel, Douglas O.; Lowe, Mark; Singh, Vijay P.",Sci Adv,256,3

This study aims to implement and evaluate the program in a multi-site randomised study in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial will be conducted at 12 residential aged care homes over 58 weeks. The program has four components: education and training, decision support tools, diagnostic equipment, and implementation facilitation with clinical systems support. The integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will be used to guide the program implementation and process evaluation. The primary outcome measure will be the number of hospital bed days used by residents, with secondary outcomes assessing emergency department transfer rates, admission rates, length of stay, family awareness and experience, staff self-efficacy and costs of both implementation and health service use. A process evaluation will assess the extent and fidelity of program implementation, mechanisms of impact and the contextual barriers and enablers. DISCUSSION: The intervention is expected to improve outcomes by reducing unnecessary hospital transfers. Fewer hospital transfers and admissions will release resources for other patients with potentially greater needs. Residential aged care home staff might benefit from feelings of empowerment in their ability to proactively manage early signs of resident deterioration. The process evaluation will be useful for supporting wider implementation of this intervention and other similar initiatives.

Disruption of epithelial and endothelial barriers is a key clinical turning point that differentiates patients who are likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes: it marks a significant escalation in respiratory symptoms, loss of viral containment and a progression toward multi-organ dysfunction. These barrier mechanisms are independently compromised by known COVID-19 risk factors, including diabetes, obesity and aging: thus, a synergism between these underlying conditions and SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms may explain why these risk factors correlate with more severe outcomes. This review examines the key cellular mechanisms that SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying risk factors utilize to disrupt barrier function. As an outlook, we propose that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) may be a therapeutic intervention that can slow COVID-19 progression and improve clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. GLP-1 signaling activates barrier-promoting processes that directly oppose the pro-inflammatory mechanisms commandeered by SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying risk factors.","Hanchard, Julia; Capó-Vélez, Coral M.; Deusch, Kai; Lidington, Darcy; Bolz, Steffen-Sebastian",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),256,9

Patients and Methods COVID-19 began to effect surgical practices across the US in March 2020. On March 17, 2020, all elective and non-emergent surgical care was deferred to prepare the Mayo Clinic Health System sites in northwest Wisconsin for an anticipated surge in COVID-19 patients. When the decision was made to reactivate the surgical practice, several major structural and operational changes were made to the regional surgical practice to optimize efficiencies. Results The structural and operational changes implemented during reactivation resulted in improved utilization of surgical resources including improvement in OR block utilization, increased available OR time, and increased case volumes. Conclusion Surgical and procedural leaders should consider a limited-time deferral of elective surgical cases to implement widespread OR efficiency strategies. The time selected for deferral of surgical cases should target a historically low surgical volume to minimize disruption to patient care and impact on overall OR functions.","Martin-Krajewski, Carie A.; Craig, Jason E.; Bledsoe, Jonathan M.; Wensink, Laurie J.; Crawford, Neal S.; Eberhardt, Angela M.; Grottke, Kara L.; Helmers, Richard A.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,256,5

Comparing our previous study of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before June 2020, we found out that the SNV clustering had changed considerably since June 2020. Apart from that the group SNVs represented by two non-synonymous mutations A23403G (S: D614G) and C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L) became dominant and carried by over 95% genomes, a few emerging groups of SNVs were recognized with sharply increased monthly occurrence ratios up to 70% in November 2020. Further investigation revealed that several SNVs were strongly associated with the mortality, but they presented distinct distribution in specific countries, e.g., Brazil, USA, Saudi Arabia, India, and Italy. SNVs including G25088T, T25A, G29861T and G29864A were adopted in a regularized logistic regression model to predict the mortality status in Brazil with the AUC of 0.84. Protein structure analysis showed that the emerging subgroups of non-synonymous SNVs and those mortality-related ones in Brazil were located on protein surface area. The clashes in protein structure introduced by these mutations might in turn affect virus pathogenesis through conformation changes, leading to the difference in transmission and virulence. Particularly, we found that SNVs tended to occur in intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs) of Spike (S) and ORF1ab, suggesting a critical role of SNVs in protein IDRs to determine protein folding and immune evasion.","Fang, S.; Liu, S.; Shen, J.; Lu, A.

Telemedicine platforms can really help in this situation, since they allow remotely monitoring Covid-19 patients, reducing the risk for the doctors, without decreasing the efficiency of the therapies and while alleviating patients’ mental issues. In this paper, we present the entire architecture and the experience of using the Tel.Te.Covid19 telemedicine platform. Projected for the treatment of chronic diseases, it has been technologically updated for the management of Covid-19 patients with the support of a group of doctors in the territory when the pandemic arrived, introducing new sensors and functionalities (e.g., the familiar use and video calls). In Tuscany (Central Italy), during the first wave of outbreak, a model for enrolling patients was created and tested. Because of the positive results, the latter has been then adopted in the second current wave. The Tel.Te.Covid19 platform has been used by 40 among general practitioners and doctors of continuity care and about 180 symptomatic patients since March 2020. Both patients and doctors have good opinion of the platform, and no hospitalisations or deaths occurred for the monitored patients, reducing also the impact on the National Healthcare System.","Panicacci, Silvia; Donati, Massimiliano; Lubrano, Alberto; Vianello, Annamaria; Ruiu, Alessio; Melani, Luca; Tomei, Antonella; Fanucci, Luca",Healthcare (Basel),256,6

The lesions in animals develop primarily as a result of vascular insult, presumably induced by the activity of viral and/or proinflammatory vasoactive mediators. Hence, the current study was designed in sheep to investigate the responses of potent vasoactivators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and/or nitric oxide (NO) in mononuclear leukocytes of PBMCs and RLOs. The results show that BTV infection of sheep led to enhanced transcription of iNOS in PBMCs and in particular RLOs. The BTV RNAs and/or antigens were readily demonstrable in these mononuclear leukocytes, suggesting the possible role of BTV in iNOS induction. Moreover, upon in vitro infection of PBMCs with BTV-23, iNOS was up-regulated in time-dependent fashion and correlated with increased NO production. The results from these in vivo and in vitro studies thus suggest iNOS and NO produced by mononuclear leukocytes may potentially contribute to vascular-related pathology of BT.","Umeshappa, Channakeshava Sokke; Singh, Karam Pal; Nanjundappa, Roopa Hebbandi; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Maan, Sushila; Maan, Narender S.",Vet Res Commun,256,18

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.","Qeadan, Fares; Honda, Trenton; Gren, Lisa H.; Dailey-Provost, Jennifer; Benson, L.

However, due to inflammatory reactions at high vector doses, adjunctive treatment may be necessary to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have been successfully used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that at high concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can impact viral infection and replication by increasing endosomal and lysosomal pH. This effect has led to investigations into the potential benefits of these drugs in the treatment of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, at lower concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine appear to exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting nucleic acid sensors, including toll-like receptor 9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. This dose-dependent effect on their mechanism of action supports observations of increased viral infections associated with lower drug doses. In this review, we explore the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, their impact on viral infections, and their potential to improve the efficacy and safety of retinal gene therapy by reducing AAV-induced immune responses. The safety and practicalities of delivering hydroxychloroquine into the retina will also be discussed.","Chandler, Laurel C.; Yusuf, Imran H.; McClements, Michelle E.; Barnard, Alun R.; MacLaren, Robert E.; Xue, Kanmin",Int J Mol Sci,256,0

SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity is controlled by the binding affinity of RBD with ACE2. To understand, how mutations in the conserved residues of RBD affect the molecular interaction with ACE2, we generated five alanine mutants i.e. Y449A, N487A, Y489A, N501A and Y505A in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the ACE2-RBD SARS-CoV-2 complex (PDB: 6M0J). Computational site directed mutagenesis induced dynamics in wild-type and mutant complexes were extensively studied through all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 150 ns. In silico mutational analysis revealed loss of important intermolecular hydrogen bonds and other non-bonded contacts, critical for molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2, which is well supported by saturation mutagenesis study of binding interface residues. MD simulations results showed that RBM motif is flexible, where mutant residues are relatively more mobile than corresponding wild-type residues. Global motion analysis through principal component studies revealed that RBD exhibits protuberant in-ward motion towards the human ACE2 binding interface which may be crucial for molecular interaction. Conclusively, the present finding are in congruence with previous experimental reports and provides detailed information on the structural basis of receptor binding by human SARS-CoV-2, which will crucial for the development of novel inhibitors or drugs to combat against SARS-CoV-2.

The notion of resistance in regional economic resilience is used to explore what impact factors shape the response to the early stage of the crisis. The analysis reveals significant differences in terms of regional economic impact between COVID-19 and the 2008 financial crisis. We find that large cities are more vulnerable and exposed to the pandemic at its early stage, state agency plays a crucial role in shaping the economic resistance in most cities. Going beyond the existing 2008 financial crisis-induced account on regional economic resilience, this paper argues that regional resistance amid COVID-19 is not merely shaped by economic structural factors but also influenced by state agency in terms of economic restriction and restoration measures. The study suggests that the nature of COVID-19 as a particular context of crisis itself needs to be taken seriously when exploring the determinants and outcomes of regional economic resilience.","Hu, Xiaohui; Li, Liangang; Dong, Ke",Cities,256,12

Bats (Chiroptera) have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection and therefore may be at risk from disease when in contact with infected people. Numerous conservation fieldwork activities are undertaken across the United Kingdom bringing potentially infected people into close proximity with bats. In this study, we analysed the risks of disease from SARS‐CoV‐2 to free‐living bat species in England through fieldworkers undertaking conservation activities and ecological survey work, using a qualitative, transparent method devised for assessing threats of disease to free‐living wild animals. The probability of exposure of bats to SARS‐CoV‐2 through fieldwork activities was estimated to range from negligible to high, depending on the proximity between bats and people during the activity. The likelihood of infection after exposure was estimated to be high and the probability of dissemination of the virus through bat populations medium. The likelihood of clinical disease occurring in infected bats was low, and therefore, the ecological, economic and environmental consequences were predicted to be low. The overall risk estimation was low, and therefore, mitigation measures are advisable. There is uncertainty in the pathogenicity of SARS‐CoV‐2 in bats and therefore in the risk estimation. Disease risk management measures are suggested, including the use of personal protective equipment, good hand hygiene and following the existing government advice. The disease risk analysis should be updated as information on the epidemiology of SARS‐CoV‐2 and related viruses in bats improves. The re‐analysis may be informed by health surveillance of free‐living bats.","Common, Sophie M; Shadbolt, Tammy; Walsh, Katherine; Sainsbury, Anthony W",Transbound Emerg Dis,256,8

Patient demographics, ECG variables, peak troponins, use of standard medications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and a predictive model of survival was developed using classification tree analysis. Of the 145 admitted patients, 38 (26%) died. Deceased patients were more likely to have a significantly higher incidence of poor R-Wave progression [6 of 37 (16.2%) Vs. 0 of 104 (0%), p < 0.001] as well as prolonged QTc values [24 of 37 (64.9%) Vs. 38 of 99 (38.4%), p 0.006]. Significant ST segment depressions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%) of the deceased category compared to 0% in the non-deceased (p < 0.01). Right and/or left atrial enlargement was more prevalent in the deceased cohort [7 of 37 (18.9%) Vs. 4 of 104 (3.8%), p = 0.03].

Coiled-coil proteins exhibit a large diversity of function (e.g. gene regulation, cell division, membrane fusion, drug extrusion) thus demonstrating the significance of oligomerization in biological systems. The classical coiled-coil domain comprises a series of consecutive heptad repeats in the protein sequence that are readily identifiable by the location of hydrophobic residues at the ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions. This gives rise to an α-helical structure in which between 2 and 7 helices are wound around each other in the form of a left-handed supercoil. More recently, structures of coiled-coil domains have been solved that have an 11 residue (undecad) or a 15 residue (pentadecad) repeat, which show the formation of a right-handed coiled-coil structure. The high stability of coiled coils, together with the presence of large internal cavities in the pentameric coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomerization matrix protein (COMPcc) and the tetrameric right-handed coiled coil of Staphylothermus marinus (RHCC) has led us and others to look for therapeutic applications. In this review, we present evidence in support of a vitamin A and vitamin D(3) binding activity for the pentameric COMPcc molecule. In addition, we will discuss exciting new developments which show that the RHCC tetramer is capable of binding the major anticancer drug cisplatin and the ability to fuse it to an antigenic epitope for the development of a new generation of vaccines.","McFarlane, Ainsley A.; Orriss, George L.; Stetefeld, Jörg",Eur J Pharmacol,256,20

This study aimed to address the preventive procedures to protect healthcare workers at hospital to avoid COVID-19, and infection control procedures to protect dental professionals in dental office. METHODS: We conducted a search of published articles from PubMed, google scholar databases using key words such as COVID-19, healthcare worker, infection control, and dental practice. Relevant articles were identified and reviewed. Most published papers were clinical reports and case studies. We have selected some of the current published papers written in English in 2020. RESULTS: Infection control procedures to protect health workers at hospitals, and dental professionals at dental office were summurised and presented. Infection control procedures for healthcare workers at hospitals include Personal protective equipment, Korea filter (KF)94 respirator, goggles, face protector, disposable waterproof long-arm gown, and gloves, and others. Extra-protection procedures should be taken with old and vulnerable healthcare workers. Dental professionals should evaluate patients in advance before starting dental treatment. Aerosols generating procedures should be avoided and personal protective equipment should be used. Dental treatment should be restricted to emergency cases only. CONCLUSION: Old medical staff should be in safer distance to avoid infection, but young physicians and nurses should work at frontline as their immunity is better than their colleagues at old age. Screening patients and measurement of the body temperature are essential measures before dental treatment.","Tarakji, Bassel; Nassani, Mohammad Zakaria; Alali, Faisal Mehsen; Abuderman, Abdulwahab A",Ethiop J Health Sci,256,16

The study aimed to evaluate vaccine coverage, post-vaccine immunity, and risk factors of non-protective levels of antibodies against measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and diphtheria in JIA patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 170 children diagnosed with JIA aged 2 to 17 years who received routine vaccinations against measles, rubella, mumps (MMR), diphtheria, and hepatitis B national vaccine schedule. In all patients, the levels of post-vaccination antibodies (IgG) for measles, rubella, mumps, hepatitis B, and diphtheria were measured with ELISA. RESULTS: Protective level of antibodies were 50% against hepatitis B, 52% - diphtheria, 58% - measles, 80% - mumps, 98% rubella. MMR’s best coverage had patients with enthesitis-related arthritis-85%, compared to oligoarthritis-70%, polyarthritis-69%, systemic arthritis-63%. Diphtheria coverage was 50, 51, 46, 63%, respectively. Incomplete MMR vaccination had 39% patients, treated with biologics, 22% with methotrexate and 14% with NSAID (p = 0.025), and 61, 46, 36% for diphtheria (p = 0.021). Incomplete vaccination was a risk factor of non-protective level of antibodies against measles (HR = 2.03 [95%CI: 1.02; 4.0], p = 0.042), mumps (HR = 6.25 [95%CI: 2.13; 17.9], p = 0.0008) and diphtheria (HR = 2.39 [95%CI: 1.18; 4.85], p = 0.016) vaccines, as well as JIA category, biologics, corticosteroids and long-term methotrexate treatment for distinct vaccines. One-third part of JIA patients continued vaccination against MMR and diphtheria without serious adverse events and JIA flare. There were no differences between patients who continued MMR vaccination or denied in the means of JIA category and treatment options. Patients, continued diphtheria vaccination rare received methotrexate (p = 0.02), biologics (p = 0.004), but had higher levels of anti-diphtheria antibodies (p = 0.024) compare who omitted vaccination. Methotrexate (OR = 9.5 [95%CI: 1.004; 90.3]) and biologics (OR = 4.4 [95%CI: 1.6; 12.1]) were predictors of omitted diphtheria revaccination. CONCLUSION: Children with JIA may have lower anti-vaccine antibody levels and required routine checks, especially in children with incomplete vaccination, biologics, systemic arthritis, and long-term methotrexate treatment. Revaccination of JIA patients was safe and effective.","Kostik, Mikhail M.; Lubimova, Natalia A.; Fridman, Irina V.; Goleva, Olga V.; Kharit, Susanna M.",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,256,20

METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.

Especially, elderly people refrained from going out. We investigated mortality rates from external causes in 2020 among Japanese elderly people. METHODS: The monthly mortality rates from accidents (V01-X59), traffic accidents (V01-V99) and suicides (X60-X84) among elderly from 2015 to November 2020 were analyzed. Ordinary monthly expected values and reference ranges (RR: 95% range) were calculated by cause and sex and compared with the observed values. RESULTS: All accidents: Abnormal increases (beyond the RR) occurred in August for both sexes. Traffic accidents: Extreme decreases (below the RR) occurred in at least 3 months from March to October for each sex. Suicides: Extreme decreases occurred in at least 2 months from February to May for each sex. Abnormal increases occurred in November for males, and in September to November for females. CONCLUSIONS: Extreme decreases in traffic accident mortalities can be explained by people staying home. Abnormal increases in accident mortalities in summer might be explained by the heat. The increases might also be related to wearing face masks. Suicide results suggest that females are especially vulnerable to the social environment created by the preventive measures against COVID-19.

Review of Current Literature and Recommendations,15.263446,6.9372,2021,"Two cosegregating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human TLR4, an A896G transition at SNP rs4986790 (D299G) and a C1196T transition at SNP rs4986791 (T399I), have been associated with LPS hyporesponsiveness and differential susceptibility to many infectious or inflammatory diseases. However, many studies failed to confirm these associations, and transfection experiments resulted in conflicting conclusions about the impact of these SNPs on TLR4 signaling. Using advanced protein modeling from crystallographic data of human and murine TLR4, we identified homologous substitutions of these SNPs in murine Tlr4, engineered a knock-in strain expressing the D298G and N397I TLR4 SNPs homozygously, and characterized in vivo and in vitro responses to TLR4 ligands and infections in which TLR4 is implicated. Our data provide new insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these SNPs decrease the TLR4 signaling efficiency and offer an experimental approach to confirm or refute human data possibly confounded by variables unrelated to the direct effects of the SNPs on TLR4 functionality.","Richard, Katharina; Piepenbrink, Kurt H.; Shirey, Kari Ann; Gopalakrishnan, Archana; Nallar, Shreeram; Prantner, Daniel J.; Perkins, Darren J.; Lai, Wendy; Vlk, Alexandra; Toshchakov, Vladimir Y.; Feng, Chiguang; Fanaroff, Rachel; Medvedev, Andrei E.; Blanco, Jorge C.G.; Vogel, Stefanie N.",J Exp Med,256,5

Most of the deaths occur from embolism and thrombus formation. We aimed to compare the predictive value of the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) and m-CHA2DS2-Vasc scores in in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. METHODS Three-hundred and ninety-four patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 between 10 June 2020 and 10 September 2020 were included. Three-hundred and sixty patients who survived were defined as the non-mortality group and the remaining 34 whose hospitalizations resulted in death were defined as the mortality group. The anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation and m-CHA2DS2-Vasc scores of the patients were calculated. RESULTS A total of 394 patients, mean age 66.2±9.7 (221 male [56.1%]) were included in this retrospective study. The median values of the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation and m-CHA2DS2-Vasc scores were different between the groups (p<0.000 for both). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both the m-CHA2DS2-Vasc and anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation scores were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (p=0.024, 95%CI 1.039-1.704 for anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation and p=0.043, 95%CI 1.012-2.088 for m-CHA2DS2-Vasc). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation score was superior to the m-CHA2DS2-Vasc score with an AUC 0.774 and SE:0.037, and p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS In our study, we showed that the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation and m-CHA2DS2-Vasc scores can be used as predictors of thrombosis and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the predictive value of the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation score was higher than that of m-CHA2DS2-Vasc. The use of the anticoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation score to assess high-risk patients in COVID-19 may be recommended.","Abacioglu, Ozge Ozcan; Yildirim, Arafat",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,256,1

Two main occupational groups were included: healthcare and essential services workers with high mobility in the city. Social, demographic, and health-related factors were collected via phone survey. Afterwards, the molecular test was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: From the 58,638 participants included in the study, 3,310 (5·6%) had a positive result. A positive result was associated with the age group (18-29 years) compared with participants aged 60 or older, participants living with more than three cohabitants, living with a confirmed case, having no affiliation to the health system compared to those with social health security, reporting a very low socioeconomic status compared to those with higher socioeconomic status, and having essential occupations compared to healthcare workers.

Here, we study how IAV-modulated changes in the lungs affect bacterial replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) from coinfected mice showed rapid bacterial proliferation 4 to 6 h after pneumococcal challenge. Metabolomic and quantitative proteomic analyses demonstrated capillary leakage with efflux of nutrients and antioxidants into the alveolar space. Pneumococcal adaptation to IAV-induced inflammation and redox imbalance increased the expression of the pneumococcal chaperone/protease HtrA. Presence of HtrA resulted in bacterial growth advantage in the IAV-infected LRT and protection from complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis due to capsular production. Absence of HtrA led to growth arrest in vitro that was partially restored by antioxidants. Pneumococcal ability to grow in the IAV-infected LRT depends on the nutrient-rich milieu with increased levels of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and its ability to adapt to and cope with oxidative damage and immune clearance.","Sender, Vicky; Hentrich, Karina; Pathak, Anuj; Tan Qian Ler, Alicia; Embaie, Bethel Tesfai; Lundström, Susanna L.; Gaetani, Massimiliano; Bergstrand, Jan; Nakamoto, Rei; Sham, Lok-To; Widengren, Jerker; Normark, Staffan; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,256,5

METHODS: In our two-phase, mixed-methods study, pandemic-specific anxiety items elicited during the qualitative phase from March 2–8, 2020 were then tested in the quantitative phase from March 16–22, 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. or U.K. residents aged 18–65. RESULTS: Of the 1,400 participants, 52% met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety. In addition to anxiety over possible personal COVID-19 infection, participants were also anxious about others’ health, others’ reactions (e.g., panic-buying, discrimination), societal problems (e.g., economic slowdown, healthcare system breakdown), and personal finances. The positive association between generic anxiety and hygiene practice frequency was explained by two interpersonal-oriented forms of pandemic-specific anxiety: anxiety over others’ health (b = 0•0040, 95% CI: 0•0031–0•0050) and others’ reactions (0•0031, 0•0021–0•0042). LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted with participants from developed countries at an early stage of the pandemic, and the results were not necessarily generalizable to developing countries or other stages of the pandemic. Also, hygiene practices was the sole behavior of interest, and the findings may differ for other behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The new findings indicate the importance of adopting a nuanced approach that unveils the multifaceted nature of anxiety using a mixed-methods design. Individuals from COVID-19-affected regions experience pandemic-specific anxiety due to concerns related to not only personal but also interpersonal-oriented issues.","Cheng, Cecilia; Wang, Hsin-yi; Chan, Linus",J Affect Disord,256,24

Vaccines are currently being rolled out to control the viral spread and prevent deaths. Emergency vaccines, using new platforms, have been approved. Their effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity in different populations are not fully known. This study aimed to discover the immunogenicity of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) BNT162b2 and adenovirus vector Ad5-nCoV vaccines through IgG antibody generation against subunit 1 of protein S (S1 IgG) and assess the side effects of the vaccines. A total of 115 vaccinated people were included, 61 of whom received the BNT162b2 vaccine, while 54 received Ad5-nCoV. Measurements of S1 IgG antibodies were carried out using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The BNT162b2 vaccine generated S1 IgG antibodies in 80.3% of the participants after the first dose. The number of seropositive participants increased to 98.36% with the administration of the second dose. The Ad5-nCoV vaccine generated S1 IgG antibodies in 88.89% of those vaccinated. Women generated more antibodies when administered either vaccine. There were no serious adverse effects from vaccination. In conclusion, not all participants had detectable S1 IgG antibodies. The Ad5-nCoV vaccine presented the most seronegative cases. The studied vaccines were shown to be safe.","Guzmán-Martínez, Oscar; Guardado, Kathia; de Guevara, Elsa Ladrón; Navarro, Saturnino; Hernández, Crescencio; Zenteno-Cuevas, Roberto; Montero, Hilda",Vaccines (Basel),256,22

We conducted a cross-sectional study among 2647 elderly participants aged 60–88 years. Data were collected through questionnaires. Demographic characteristics, screen time, using electronic devices before sleep, health status, lifestyles, sleep quality, and other associated factors were investigated. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the associated factors of screen time and using electronic devices before sleep. The crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A total of 1784 subjects completed the questionnaire. There were 6.89% participants with prolonged screen time and 13.45% using electronic devices before sleep frequently. Prolonged screen time was associated with personal monthly income (aOR = 1.205, p = 0.001), number of household residents (aOR = 0.860, p = 0.010), rural residents (aOR = 0.617, p = 0.038), and regular drinkers (aOR = 2.889, p < 0.001).

To this end there have been great efforts to train an additional 300 000 GPs by 2020. This paper examines the perspective of practitioners in Henan, China, regarding general practice. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach using focus group discussions (FGD), and structured questionnaires. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven FGDs and responses to 1887 questionnaires included medical students, primary care doctors and GP residents in Henan. RESULTS: The three surveyed medical groups have some awareness of the attributes of general practice (eg, comprehensiveness, first contact and coordination), but often misinterpret what being a GP entails. Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. First, the GPs’ role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis)interpreted as an ‘all-round doctor’. Second, the GP’s responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Third, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples’ health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs’ main responsibility was considered to be public health work. CONCLUSION: The misunderstandings of the roles and responsibilities of GPs render problematic the policy foundation of China’s GP-centred primary care system. Pursuing the quantity of GPs on its own is meaningless, since the number needed depends on the delineated role of GPs. Top priority is to establish clarity about the GP role, which requires reforming the health delivery system to address issues with fragmented care, strategically taking into account the development of GPs with work delegation and substitution and providing more clarity on the distinction between general practice and public health.","Zhu, Jiming; Ariana, Proochista",BMJ Open,256,24

Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India remain still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB radiation, whilst further exploring, whether the monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB radiation in COVID-19 deaths in India. We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020–19 November 2020 (n = 6751). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB radiation as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that a unit increase in UVI and the monsoon season are separately associated with 1.2 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decrease of growth rates of COVID-19 deaths by 33% (= − 1.2 percentage points) However, the monsoon season, mitigates the protective role of UVI by 77% (0.92 percentage points). Our results indicate a protective role of UVB radiation in mitigating COVID-19 deaths in India. Furthermore, we find evidence that the monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVB radiation. Our study outlines the roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.","Moozhipurath, Rahul Kalippurayil; Kraft, Lennart",Sci Rep,256,1

We also demonstrated that it was compatible with a microfluidic chip that could be eventually incorporated into a PoC for easy and broad deployment using portable optical detectors. After standardization of the different reaction steps, we constructed and validated a plastic chip that could easily be scaled to high-volume manufacturing in the future. The solution proved comparable to conventional ELISA assays traditionally performed by the clinicians in their laboratory and should be compatible with other antibody detection directly from patient samples.","Fiordelisio, Tatiana; Buendia-Roldan, Ivette; Hautefeuille, Mathieu; Del-Rio, Diana; Ríos-López, Diana G.; Zamarrón-Hernández, Diego; Amat-Shapiro, Samuel; Campa-Higareda, Andrea; Jiménez-Díaz, Edgar; González-Villa, Erika; Nelson-Mora, Janikua; García-Carreño, Natllely; López-Aparicio, Jehú; Montes, Eduardo; Santiago-Ruiz, Armando; Pardo, Annie; Selman, Moisés",Biosensors (Basel),256,30

The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5′ end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5′ ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3′ ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3′ end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.","Scott, Alan F.; Schmeckpeper, Barbara J.; Abdelrazik, Mona; Comey, Catherine Theisen; O'Hara, Bruce; Rossiter, Judith Pratt; Cooley, Tim; Heath, Peter; Smith, Kirby D.; Margolet, Louise",Genomics,256,8

Research is needed to better understand how resource constraints and systemic inequalities contribute to moral distress in order to develop effective mitigation strategies. Oncology providers in low‐ and middle‐income countries are well positioned to provide insight into the moral experience of cancer care priority setting and expertise to guide solutions. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 22 oncology physicians, nurses, program leaders, and clinical advisors at a cancer center in Rwanda. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the framework method. RESULTS: Participants identified sources of moral distress at three levels of engagement with resource prioritization: witnessing program‐level resource constraints drive cancer disparities, implementing priority setting decisions into care of individual patients, and communicating with patients directly about resource prioritization implications. They recommended individual and organizational‐level interventions to foster resilience, such as communication skills training and mental health support for clinicians, interdisciplinary team building, fair procedures for priority setting, and collective advocacy for resource expansion and equity. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the current literature an in‐depth examination of the impact of resource constraints and inequities on clinicians in a low‐resource setting. Effective interventions are urgently needed to address moral distress, reduce clinician burnout, and promote well‐being among a critical but strained oncology workforce. Collective advocacy is concomitantly needed to address the structural forces that constrain resources unevenly and perpetuate disparities in cancer care and outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: For many oncology clinicians worldwide, resource limitations constrain routine clinical practice and necessitate decisions about prioritizing cancer care. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first in‐depth analysis of how resource constraints and priority setting lead to moral distress among oncology clinicians in a low‐resource setting. Effective individual and organizational interventions and collective advocacy for equity in cancer care are urgently needed to address moral distress and reduce clinician burnout among a strained global oncology workforce. Lessons from low‐resource settings can be gleaned as high‐income countries face growing needs to prioritize oncology resources.","DeBoer, Rebecca J.; Mutoniwase, Espérance; Nguyen, Cam; Ho, Anita; Umutesi, Grace; Nkusi, Eugene; Sebahungu, Fidele; Van Loon, Katherine; Shulman, Lawrence N.; Shyirambere, Cyprien",Oncologist,256,2

In this review, we critically appraise guidance in regard to pharmacologic considerations unique to pregnant and lactating women with coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). We summarize the evidence, which supports the routine use of antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate and low‐dose aspirin where clinically indicated, and if not contraindicated for medical reasons. We highlight that decision‐making about initiation, dose and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation for pregnant patients with COVID‐19 should be made by a multidisciplinary team and must consider disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient versus outpatient status, underlying comorbidities, and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation. We discuss the rationale behind suggested modifications to the use of peripartum analgesia and anaesthesia at the time of the pandemic, as well as considerations specific to mechanically‐ventilated pregnant patients. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the reduction in mortality in patients with COVID‐19 with the use of corticosteroids, while tabulating up‐to‐date information on the safety of various investigational therapies for COVID‐19.

This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role : among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19 ).

We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes—larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property—and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: city-wide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community-based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions.

OBJECTIVES: To examine critical factors associated with interest in enrolling in a physical activity (PA) research intervention among a predominant group of adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) and develop a theory that can enhance future recruitment success. SETTING: Participants were recruited through the network of a community exercise facility for people with physical disabilities. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 22 wheelchair users (mean age 46 ± 13 years; SCI [n = 19], cerebral palsy [n = 1]; multiple sclerosis [n = 1]; and bilateral limb loss [n = 1]) in either a one-on-one format or focus group. Interview data were coded, and these codes were organized into conceptual categories using a constructivist grounded theory framework. RESULTS: Adults with SCI conceive three core concerns with enrolling into a PA trial: (1) capability to participate in the program due to scheduling, transportation, and secondary health conditions; (2) mental balancing of anticipated benefits versus the difficulty of starting the program; and (3) desirability of the program characteristics based on their preferences and needs. Concerns were organized into a theory that may enhance future recruitment success. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment is often overlooked in PA research for people with SCI despite it being a primary rate-limiting factor that severely limits the external validity of published studies. Study findings identified core recruitment concerns that are likely similar with general barriers to PA participation. This paper proposed a 3-step decision-making process that can serve as a starting point for overcoming recruitment issues in PA research with people with SCI.","Lai, Byron W.; Rimmer, James H.; Yates, Alex; Jeter, Amanda; Young, Hui-Ju; Thirumalai, Mohanraj; Mehta, Tapan; Wilroy, Jereme",Spinal Cord,256,26

While much research and focus surrounds COVID-19 vaccine development, testing, and supportive management, little is known about the determinants of non-medical, personal impact of COVID-19 prevention policies. We aimed to understand determinants of non-medical COVID-19 impact and to account for its multileveled, intersectional nature of associations. Methods: This cross-sectional, multi-level, convergent mixed-methods study assessed a range of beliefs, practices, and experiences relating to COVID-19. We recruited a global sample (n=7,411) using both Facebook and Amazon mTURK platforms. We constructed a novel data-driven non-medical COVID-19 Impact Score and four subcomponents (Personal Action, Supply-related, Cancellations, and Livelihood impacts). We used generalized estimating equation models with identity link functions to determine concomitant association of individual, household, and country-level variables on the impact scores. We also classified 20,015 qualitative excerpts from 6859 respondents using an 80-code codebook. Results: Total and component impact scores varied significantly by region with Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean observing the highest impact scores. Multilevel modeling indicated that individual-level sociocultural variables accounted for much of this variation with COVID-related worry, knowledge, struggles in accessing food and supplies, and worsening mental health most strongly associated with non-medical impact. Family responsibilities, personal COVID medical experience, and health locus of control, in addition to country-level variables reflecting social and health challenge, were also significantly and independently associated with non-medical impact. Discussion: Non-medical personal impact of COVID-19 affects most people internationally, largely in response to shutdowns, implementing prevention requirements, and through economic consequences. In the context where most of the world does not have direct medical experience with COVID-19, this phenomena of non-medical impact is profound, and likely impacts sustainability of public health interventions aimed at containing COVID-19.","Dye, T.

Currently, no approved and licensed vaccine or antivirals exist. Here, we investigated the efficacy of ChAdOx1 NiV(B), a simian adenovirus-based vaccine encoding NiV glycoprotein (G) Bangladesh, in Syrian hamsters. Prime-only as well as prime-boost vaccination resulted in uniform protection against a lethal challenge with NiV Bangladesh: all animals survived challenge and we were unable to find infectious virus either in oral swabs, lung or brain tissue. Furthermore, no pathological lung damage was observed. A single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also prevented disease and lethality from heterologous challenge with NiV Malaysia. While we were unable to detect infectious virus in swabs or tissue of animals challenged with the heterologous strain, a very limited amount of viral RNA could be found in lung tissue by in situ hybridization. A single dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also provided partial protection against Hendra virus and passive transfer of antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 NiV(B) vaccination partially protected Syrian hamsters against NiV Bangladesh. From these data, we conclude that ChAdOx1 NiV(B) is a suitable candidate for further NiV vaccine pre-clinical development.","van Doremalen, Neeltje; Lambe, Teresa; Sebastian, Sarah; Bushmaker, Trenton; Fischer, Robert; Feldmann, Friederike; Haddock, Elaine; Letko, Michael; Avanzato, Victoria A.; Rissanen, Ilona; LaCasse, Rachel; Scott, Dana; Bowden, Thomas A.; Gilbert, Sarah; Munster, Vincent",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,256,26

Such studies can elucidate essential transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies. Methods: We analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19. Findings: Up to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of [≥]8 secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed [≥]4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age. Conclusion: We found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised, retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

IFTT with paraovarian cysts is most frequently reported in studies. Here, we reported a patient diagnosed with IFTT associated with a paraovarian cyst, and we conducted a literature review for IFTT, aiming to identify valuable information that will be helpful for diagnosis and treatment for fallopian tube torsions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old girl presented with a 10-day history of right lower abdominal pain that worsened 2 days before presentation. On presentation, ultrasound showed a 5.8 * 5.5 cm hypoechoic cyst adjacent to the right ovary, and between the cyst and ovary, a tortuous thickened tube was visualized. Laparoscopy revealed a triple torsion of the right fallopian tube with a 6-cm paraovarian cyst, and tubal conservation surgery was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological diagnosis revealed serous papillary cystadenoma. CONCLUSION: Paraovarian cystic dilatation often occurs in adolescence and can induce fallopian torsion when the size of the cyst reaches 5-cm. In our review, the median age of patients diagnosed with IFTT with paraovarian cysts was 15 years old, and the main clinical manifestation was emergency abdominal pain. The associated symptoms were variable, and vomiting was the most commonly associated symptom. Salpingectomy was the most common procedure performed; however, timely surgical intervention can effectively avoid salpingectomy.","Qian, Liang; Wang, Xue; Li, Dingheng; Li, Songyi; Ding, Jiashan",BMC Womens Health,256,20

Articles related to the virus were being rapidly published by January 2020. A small fraction of these publications comprised reports of prospective clinical trials (0.25%), and many of these trials have imparted conflicting conclusions, leading to confusion among the public and the scientific community. Additionally, the pandemic has raised many serious scientific and ethical concerns related to clinical research. In this review, we divided the conduct of clinical research trials into three steps and critically reviewed each step, along with the challenges and obstacles arising amid the ongoing crisis. The clinical research steps we reviewed include (1) clinical trial design factors such as social and scientific value, feasibility, single vs. multicenter trials, randomization, control groups, endpoints, off-label and compassionate use of medications, data analysis, and verifying the integrity of data; (2) ethical issues such as committee approvals, efficiency, virtual visits and remote monitoring, informed consent, shipping investigational products, and external monitoring and audits; and (3) publication and sharing of preprints, press releases, social media, and misinformation. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting existing clinical trials for other ailments and diseases, including cancer, with most trials being delayed or deferred. Although urgency is needed to communicate effective treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19, research efforts should maintain the same high-quality core ethical principles that governed human subject research before the pandemic. Despite the catastrophic devastation caused by the pandemic, the adoption of more flexible, cost-effective methods of conducting clinical trials (without compromising ethical conduct, safety, or data integrity, while maintaining research efficiency) represents a potential silver lining. Streamlining clinical research will help to congruently address other important health issues, despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Hashem, Hasan; Abufaraj, Mohammad; Tbakhi, Abdelghani; Sultan, Iyad",Front Med (Lausanne),256,14

However, cisplatin often loses effectiveness because most tumors acquire drug resistance over time. As EGFR is the most important pro-survival/proliferation signal receptor in NSCLC cells, we aimed at investigating whether cisplatin resistance is related to EGFR activation and further evaluating the combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib (EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI) on cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EGFR activation was analysed in parental and cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines (H358 and H358(R), A549 and A549(R)). Cellular proliferation and apoptosis of H358(R)/A549(R) cells treated with cisplatin or gefitinib, alone or in combination were investigated, and the related effector protein was detected by western blot analysis. Anti-tumor effect of two drugs combined was evaluated in animal models of H358(R) xenografts in vivo. RESULTS: EGFR was significantly phosphorylated in cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells H358(R) and A549(R) than their parental cells. In H358(R) and A549(R) cells, anti-proliferative ability of gefitinib was further improved, and gefitinib combined with cisplatin enhanced inhibition of cellular survive/proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis in vitro. The combined effects were also associated with the inhibition of EGFR downstream effector proteins. Similarly, in vivo, gefitinib and cisplatin in combination significantly inhibited tumor growth of H358(R) xenografts. CONCLUSION: Abnormal activation of EGFR may induce wtEGFR NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin. The combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib suggest that gefitinib, as a combination therapy for patients with cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC should be considered.","Li, Amin; Cao, Weiya; Liu, Xueke; Zhang, Yinci; Ma, Yongfang; Xu, Ruyue; Zhang, Rongbo; Liu, Xinkuang; Zhou, Shuping; Wang, Ruikai; Liu, Jiachang; Tang, Xiaolong",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,256,16

The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this group are still unknown. Young female cancer patients need extra support in this unique situation. We want to explore if their quality of life could be affected by online group psychotherapy during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey, EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered to a cohort of young gynecologic cancer patients. The questionnaire also incorporated questions about their specific diagnoses and current treatment. Inclusion criteria included female patients aged 18-45 who were diagnosed with cancer during the last 5 years. We asked selected patients to fill the survey twice, before and after group psychotherapy sessions. Online group psychotherapy was conducted for 3 consecutive months, three times per week, using the interactive ZOOM platform. Results: Total of 25 patients aged 18-45 were included in the study, 17 patients were breast and 8 were cervical cancer patients. 52% were receiving hormonal therapy, remaining patients were receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy targeted treatment, or was on follow-up.

Colloidal gold-based lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA), which has been combined with CRISPR/Cas-based nucleic detection, usually associates with drawbacks of relative high background and the subjectivity in naked-eye read-out of the results. Here, we developed a novel system composed of Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection and up-converting phosphor technology (UPT)-based LFA (UPT–LFA), termed Cas12a-UPTLFA. We further demonstrated the utility of this platform in highly sensitive and specific detection of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of the deadly plague. Due to high infectivity and mortality, as well as the potential to be misused as bioterrorism agent, a culture-free, ultrasensitive, specific, and rapid detection method for Y. pestis has long been desired. By incorporating isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification, the Cas12a-UPTLFA we established can successfully detect genomic DNA of Y. pestis as low as 3 attomolar (aM) and exhibited high sensitivity (93.75%) and specificity (90.63%) for detection of spiked blood samples with a detection limit of 10(2) colony-forming unit per 100 μl of mouse blood. With a portable biosensor, Cas12a-UPTLFA assay can be operated easily by non-professional personnel. Taken together, we have developed a novel Cas12a-UPTLFA platform for rapid detection of Y. pestis with high sensitivity and specificity, which is portable, not expensive, and easy to operate as a point-of-care method. This detection system can easily be extended to detect other pathogens and holds great promise for on-site detection of emerging infectious pathogens.","You, Yang; Zhang, Pingping; Wu, Gengshan; Tan, Yafang; Zhao, Yong; Cao, Shiyang; Song, Yajun; Yang, Ruifu; Du, Zongmin",Front Microbiol,256,1

However, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with neurological disorders. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and its effect on preexisting neurological symptoms in patients with comorbid neurological disorder and COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) and medRxiv databases for reports of patients with both neurological disorders and COVID-19. Studies reporting data on changes in the symptoms of preexisting neurological disorders and/or the severity of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles with 2278 patients with comorbid neurological disorder and COVID-19 were identified. Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson’s disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %).

Although animal- and in vitro-based studies of NDs have provided the field with an extensive understanding of some of the mechanisms underlying these diseases, findings from these studies have not yielded substantial progress in identifying treatment options for patient populations. This necessitates the development of complementary model systems that are better suited to recapitulate human-specific features of ND pathogenesis. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems, such as cerebral organoids generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells, hold significant potential to model NDs in a complex, tissue-like environment.

Yet repair often fails to mitigate caries progression. Needed is an effective behavioral intervention to address underlying behavioral causes. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a behaviorally focused, family-centered intervention, the MySmileBuddy Program (MSB Program), to reduce ECC progression in high-risk preschoolers in New York City. Recruitment will target 858 children ages 24–71 months with ECC and their parents from primary care medical and dental clinics. The study aims to assess the MSB Program’s efficacy to: (1) decrease ECC progression measured 12-months post-randomization; and (2) enhance adoption of a low cariogenic diet and twice-daily fluoridated toothpaste use compared to control group. Potential causal pathways (mediators and moderators) will be explored. The MSB Program equips community health workers (CHWs) with an app that facilitates multilevel risk assessment and provides motivational interviewing-based counseling to inform parents about the caries process, develop personalized goals, and create family-level action plans to achieve targeted behaviors. Social support from CHWs (4 interactions during the 6-month intervention, supplemented by up to 4 in-person/remote contacts throughout the 12-month study period, based on need) is bolstered by automated text messages. Participants will be randomized to a Control Group (paper-based educational handout plus toothbrushes and fluoridated toothpaste for the child) or Intervention Group (MSB Program, two tooth-brushing observations with feedback and instruction, and toothbrushes and toothpaste for the entire family). All children will receive visual ICDAS dental examinations and parents will complete study measures at baseline and 12-months. An incentive up to $150 plus round-trip transit cards ($5.50 value) will be provided. DISCUSSION: This study hypothesizes that the MSB Program can reduce ECC progression in a high-risk population. Sufficient incentives and a focus on establishing rapport between participants and CHWs are anticipated to mitigate recruitment and retention challenges.

We sought to understand the ways in which COVID-19 prompted changes in clinical practices in abortion care among independent abortion clinics. STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed independent US abortion clinics and documented changes in practice regarding the provision of abortion since March 1, 2020. RESULTS: Among about 153 independent clinics invited, 100 clinics contributed relevant data and were included in the analytic sample. A total of 87% reported changes in protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported changes included moving to telehealth (phone or video) for follow-up (71%), starting or increasing telehealth for patient consultations and screening (41%), reducing Rh testing (43%) and other tests (42%), and omitting the preabortion ultrasound (15%). A total of 20% reported allowing quick pickup of medication abortion pills, and 4% began mailing medications directly to patients after a telehealth consultation. Clinical practice changes were reported throughout all regions of the US, but facilities in the Northeast (73%) were more likely to report starting or increasing telehealth than facilities in the South (23%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated use of telehealth among independent abortion clinics, but many clinics, particularly those in the South, have been unable to make these changes. Other practices such as reducing preabortion ultrasounds were less common in all regions despite clinical guidelines and evidence supporting such changes in practice and positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a window of opportunity to remove barriers to abortion, including expanding telehealth and reducing preabortion tests. Clinics can strive for a culture shift towards simplifying the provision of medication abortion and routinely avoiding preabortion tests and in-person visits. Such changes in practice could have positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care.","Upadhyay, Ushma D.; Schroeder, Rosalyn; Roberts, Sarah C.M.",Contracept X,256,28

With the aim to face the COVID-19 data collection, harmonization and integration problems, we present the design and development of COVID-WAREHOUSE, a data warehouse that models, integrates and stores the COVID-19 data made available daily by the Italian Protezione Civile Department and several pollution and climate data made available by the Italian Regions. After an automatic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) step, COVID-19 cases, pollution measures and climate data, are integrated and organized using the Dimensional Fact Model, using two main dimensions: time and geographical location. COVID-WAREHOUSE supports OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) analysis, provides a heatmap visualizer, and allows easy extraction of selected data for further analysis. The proposed tool can be used in the context of Public Health to underline how the pandemic is spreading, with respect to time and geographical location, and to correlate the pandemic to pollution and climate data in a specific region. Moreover, public decision-makers could use the tool to discover combinations of pollution and climate conditions correlated to an increase of the pandemic, and thus, they could act in a consequent manner. Case studies based on data cubes built on data from Lombardia and Puglia regions are discussed. Our preliminary findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic is significantly spread in regions characterized by high concentration of particulate in the air and the absence of rain and wind, as even stated in other works available in literature.","Agapito, Giuseppe; Zucco, Chiara; Cannataro, Mario",Int J Environ Res Public Health,256,4

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with AIH and COVID‐19 from 34 centers in Europe and the Americas. We analyzed factors associated with severe COVID‐19 outcomes, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission, and/or death. The outcomes of patients with AIH were compared to a propensity score–matched cohort of patients without AIH but with chronic liver diseases (CLD) and COVID‐19. The frequency and clinical significance of new‐onset liver injury (alanine aminotransferase > 2 × the upper limit of normal) during COVID‐19 was also evaluated. We included 110 patients with AIH (80% female) with a median age of 49 (range, 18‐85) years at COVID‐19 diagnosis. New‐onset liver injury was observed in 37.1% (33/89) of the patients. Use of antivirals was associated with liver injury (P = 0.041; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.05‐10.78), while continued immunosuppression during COVID‐19 was associated with a lower rate of liver injury (P = 0.009; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09‐0.71). The rates of severe COVID‐19 (15.5% versus 20.2%, P = 0.231) and all‐cause mortality (10% versus 11.5%, P = 0.852) were not different between AIH and non‐AIH CLD. Cirrhosis was an independent predictor of severe COVID‐19 in patients with AIH (P < 0.001; OR, 17.46; 95% CI, 4.22‐72.13). Continuation of immunosuppression or presence of liver injury during COVID‐19 was not associated with severe COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: This international, multicenter study reveals that patients with AIH were not at risk for worse outcomes with COVID‐19 than other causes of CLD. Cirrhosis was the strongest predictor for severe COVID‐19 in patients with AIH. Maintenance of immunosuppression during COVID‐19 was not associated with increased risk for severe COVID‐19 but did lower the risk for new‐onset liver injury during COVID‐19.","Efe, Cumali; Dhanasekaran, Renumathy; Lammert, Craig; Ebik, Berat; Higuera‐de la Tijera, Fatima; Aloman, Costica; Rıza Calışkan, Ali; Peralta, Mirta; Gerussi, Alessio; Massoumi, Hatef; Catana, Andreea M.; Torgutalp, Murat; Purnak, Tugrul; Rigamonti, Cristina; Gomez Aldana, Andres Jose; Khakoo, Nidah; Kacmaz, Hüseyin; Nazal, Leyla; Frager, Shalom; Demir, Nurhan; Irak, Kader; Ellik, Zeynep Melekoğlu; Balaban, Yasemin; Atay, Kadri; Eren, Fatih; Cristoferi, Laura; Batıbay, Ersin; Urzua, Álvaro; Snijders, Romee; Kıyıcı, Murat; Akyıldız, Murat; Ekin, Nazım; Carr, Rotonya M.; Harputluoğlu, Murat; Hatemi, Ibrahim; Mendizabal, Manuel; Silva, Marcelo; Idilman, Ramazan; Silveira, Marina; Drenth, Joost P.H.; Assis, David N.; Björnsson, Einar; Boyer, James L.; Invernizzi, Pietro; Levy, Chyntia; Schiano, Thomas D.; Ridruejo, Ezequiel; Wahlin, Staffan",Hepatology,256,32

The empirical findings for aggregate consumption reveal that only negative shocks have a significant impact on ecological footprint. Similarly, different sources of energy consumption have diverse asymmetric effects on ecological footprint. The positive (negative) shocks to oil and gas consumption increase (decrease) ecological footprint. Thus, an increase in oil consumption has a deteriorating impact on environmental quality while a decrease in gas consumption has a favorable impact on environmental quality. The asymmetric relationships also hold between coal consumption, electricity consumption, and ecological footprint. The positive shocks to coal and electricity consumption are negatively related with environmental quality while negative shocks are positively related with environmental quality.","Majeed, Muhammad Tariq; Tauqir, Aisha; Mazhar, Maria; Samreen, Isma",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,256,16

In this study, we focused on the anti-PEDV and anti-proinflammatory cytokine secretion mechanisms of GLY. We found that PEDV infection had no effect on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein and mRNA levels, but that TLR4 regulated PEDV infection and the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we demonstrated that TLR4 regulated p38 phosphorylation but not extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (Erk1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) phosphorylation, and that GLY inhibited p38 phosphorylation but not Erk1/2 and JNK phosphorylation. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and p38. We demonstrated that inhibition of HMGB1 using an antibody, mutation, or knockdown decreased p38 phosphorylation. Thus, HMGB1 participated in activation of p38 through TLR4. Collectively, our data indicated that GLY inhibited PEDV infection and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion via the HMGB1/TLR4-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway.","Gao, Ruyi; Zhang, Yongshuai; Kang, Yuhui; Xu, Weiyin; Jiang, Luyao; Guo, Tingting; Huan, Changchao",Int J Mol Sci,256,1

To do so, we investigate large Italian firms’ discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms’ Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms’ ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms’ issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data.","Patuelli, Alessia; Caldarelli, Guido; Lattanzi, Nicola; Saracco, Fabio",PLoS One,256,18

We discuss the diverse interactions of the extracellular matrix with hepatic cells and the surrounding matrix in liver fibrosis, with the focus on the molecular pathways and the mechanisms that regulate extracellular matrix remodeling. RECENT FINDINGS: The extracellular matrix not only provides structure and support for the cells, but also controls cell behavior by providing adhesion signals and by acting as a reservoir of growth factors and cytokines. SUMMARY: Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix. During fibrogenesis, the natural remodeling process of the extracellular matrix varies, resulting in the excessive accumulation of its components, mainly collagens. Signals released by the extracellular matrix induce the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which are the major source of extracellular matrix and most abundant myofibroblasts in the liver.

In addition to new term generation, CIDO also adopted various terms from existing ontologies and developed new relations and axioms to semantically represent our annotated knowledge. The CIDO knowledgebase was systematically analyzed for scientific insights. To support rational drug design, a “Host-coronavirus interaction (HCI) checkpoint cocktail” strategy was proposed to interrupt the important checkpoints in the dynamic HCI network, and ontologies would greatly support the design process with interoperable knowledge representation and reasoning.","Liu, Yingtong; Hur, Junguk; Chan, Wallace K.

However, funding must flow in a flexible enough fashion for local governments to tailor their efforts to preserve vital services and rebuild local economies.

To date, little is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with bipolar disorder as a particularly vulnerable group. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in Austria at two points of measurement (T1 April 2020 during the first lockdown vs. T2 May 2020 at post-lockdown). The sample comprises 20 patients with bipolar disorder (mean age = 49.4 ± 15.6 years) and 20 healthy controls (mean age = 32.7 ± 9.6 years). A 2 × 2 factorial design to compare two time points (T1 vs. T2) and two groups (patients vs. healthy controls) was used. Main outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and a (non-validated and non-standardized) assessment to determine COVID-19 fears and emotional distress due to social distancing. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the longitudinal association of COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing during lockdown (T1) and psychological symptoms after lockdown (T2). RESULTS: At T1, results demonstrated higher scores in BSI-18 subscales depression, anxiety and global severity index as well as emotional distress due to social distancing in bipolar patients compared to controls. There was a significant time x group interaction in the BSI-18 subscale somatization showing a decreasing trend in patients with BD compared to controls. No time effects in BSI-18 subscales or COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing were observed. Regression analyses showed that COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted somatization, only in patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a connection between the lockdown measures and somatization symptoms observed in patients. When the first steps of easing the social restrictions in May 2020 took place, somatization decreased only in the bipolar compared to the control group. Higher COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted later symptoms at post-lockdown. Long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic need further investigations to improve current therapeutic approaches and prevent fears and distress during lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder in times of crisis.","Dalkner, Nina; Wagner-Skacel, Jolana; Ratzenhofer, Michaela; Fellendorf, Frederike; Lenger, Melanie; Maget, Alexander; Tmava-Berisha, Adelina; Pilz, René; Queissner, Robert; Hamm, Carlo; Bengesser, Susanne; Platzer, Martina; Birner, Armin; Reininghaus, Eva",Int J Bipolar Disord,256,33

To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self‐assembly properties of the SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 å resolution crystal structure of this protein's N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS‐CoV. While the N2b domain forms a dimer in solution, addition of the C‐terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a homotetramer. Using hydrogen‐deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an α‐helix that self‐associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000 SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self‐assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle, with implications for both drug design and antibody‐based testing.

Similar antecedents have been known for the previous viral infections, including from coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS). A sound understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to the biological sex bias in the survival outcomes of the patients in relation to COVID-19 will act as an essential requisite for developing a sex-differentiated approach for therapeutic management of this disease. Recent studies which have explored molecular mechanism(s) behind sex-based differences in COVID-19 pathogenesis are scarce; however, existing evidence, for other respiratory viral infections, viz.

Recently, antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies were found increased in a large number of COVID-19 patients. Elevated aPL have been well documented in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis and/or obstetrical morbidity. Among treatment regimen of APS, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is one of the molecules proposed in the primary prevention of thrombosis and obstetrical morbidity in those patients. Due to its antithrombotic properties documented in APS therapy, HCQ could be considered a good candidate for the prevention of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients in association with anticoagulant and its repurposing deserves further evaluation.","Devaux, Christian A.; Camoin-Jau, Laurence; Mege, Jean-Louis; Raoult, Didier",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,256,22

Ophthalmological abnormalities are relatively rare among COVID-19-infected patients. The aim of our study was to report orbital and visual pathways MRI findings in a nationwide multicenter cohort of patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This IRB-approved retrospective multi-center study included participants presenting with severe COVID-19, who underwent brain MRI from March 4(th) to May 1(st) 2020. Two neuroradiologists (“blinded”), blinded to all data, individually analyzed morphological MRIs focusing on the orbits and the visual pathways. A second consensus reading session was performed in the case of disagreement between both readers. Clinical and ophthalmological data were compared to MRI findings. Descriptive statistical analysis and interobserver agreement for MRI reading using non-weighted Cohen kappa statistics were performed. RESULTS: 129 participants (43 [33%] women and 86 [67%] men, mean age 63 ± 14 years) were included in the study. 17/129 (13%) patients had abnormal MRI findings of the orbit or visual pathways. 11/17 (65%) patients had a FLAIR-WI hyperintense optic disc. 6/17 (35%) patients had abnormal signal of at least one of the visual pathway structures: 6/6 (100%) of the optic nerve, 1/6 (17%) of the optic chiasm, 2/6 (33%) of the optic tract and 1/6 (17%) of the optic radiations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a substantial number of patients with severe COVID-19 presented with abnormal MRI findings of the orbit or visual pathways, which might lead to potentially severe visual impairment.","Lecler, Augustin; Cotton, François; Lersy, Francois; Kremer, Stéphane; Héran, Françoise",J Neuroradiol,256,32

To examine if interventional policies due to COVID-19 have had a similar impact in the US state of California, this paper investigates the spatiotemporal patterns and changes in air pollution before, during and after the lockdown of the state, comparing the air quality measurements in 2020 with historical averages from 2015 to 2019. Through time series analysis, a sudden drop and uptick of air pollution are found around the dates when shutdown and reopening were ordered, respectively. The spatial patterns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) show a decreasing trend over the locations of major powerplants and an increasing trend over residential areas near interactions of national highways. Ground-based observations around California show a 38%, 49%, and 31% drop in the concentration of NO2, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) during the lockdown (March 19–May 7) compared to before (January 26–March 18) in 2020. These are 16%, 25% and 19% sharper than the means of the previous five years in the same periods, respectively.

ER stress induces the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which compromises the stimulus and then determines whether the cell survives or dies. In recent years, ongoing research has suggested that these pathways may be linked to the autophagic response, which plays a key role in the cell's response to various stressors. Autophagy performs a self-digestion function, and its activation protects cells against certain pathogens. However, the link between the UPR and autophagy may be more complicated. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other. Experimental studies have found that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to escape the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host's defense to their advantage; thus, this topic is a critical area in antiviral research. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about how RNA viruses, including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, and dengue virus, regulate these processes. We also discuss recent discoveries and how these will produce novel strategies for antiviral treatment.","Jheng, Jia-Rong; Ho, Jin-Yuan; Horng, Jim-Tong",Front Microbiol,256,26

Fast public health interventions through antibodies, anti-virals or novel vaccine strategies to control the virus and disease transmission have been extremely followed. SARS-CoV-2 shares about 79% genomic similarity with SARS-CoV and approximately 50% with MERS-CoV. Based on these similarities, prior knowledge in treating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be used as the basis of majority of the alternatives for controlling SARS-CoV-2. Immunotherapy is an effective strategy for clinical treatment of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Passive antibody therapy, which decreases the virus replication and disease severity, is assessed as an effective therapeutic approach to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. The close similarity between SARS-CoV-2 genome with the SARS-CoV genome caused both coronaviruses to bind to the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that found in the human lung. There are several strategies to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which the majority of them are based on those developed previously for SARS-CoV. The interaction between the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 on the host cell surface leads to the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. S protein, which is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies, has been targeted by most of these strategies. Vaccines that induce an immune response against the S protein to inhibit its binding with the host ACE2 receptor, can be considered as effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aimed to review frontier therapeutics and vaccination strategies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","SHEIKHSHAHROKH, Amirhossein; RANJBAR, Reza; SAEIDI, Elnaz; SAFARPOOR DEHKORDI, Farhad; HEIAT, Mohammad; GHASEMI-DEHKORDI, Payam; GOODARZI, Hamed",Iran J Public Health,256,20

METHODS: Patients suspected of COVID-19 with a negative first RT-PCR testing were retrospectively revalued after undergoing CT. CT was reviewed by two radiologists and classified as suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia or negative. The performance of both first RT-PCR result and CT was evaluated by using sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) and by using the second RT-PCR test as the reference standard. CT findings for confirmed COVID-19 positive or negative were compared by using the Pearson chi-squared test (P values < 0.05) RESULTS: Totally, 337 patients suspected of COVID-19 underwent CT and nasopharyngeal swabs in March 2020. Eighty-seven out of 337 patients had a negative first RT-PCR result; of these, 68 repeated RT-PCR testing and were included in the study.

The aim of this study was to determine if laboratory-grown influenza A (H1N1) virus maintained infectivity on the surfaces of personal protective equipment and clothing used in healthcare settings. METHODS: Influenza A virus (0.5 mL) was deposited on the surface of a rubber glove, an N95 particulate respirator, a surgical mask made of non-woven fabric, a gown made of Dupont Tyvek, a coated wooden desk, and stainless steel. Each sample was left for 1, 8, and 24 h, and hemagglutination (HA) and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/mL were measured. RESULTS: The HA titer of this influenza A virus did not decrease in any of the materials tested even after 24 h. The infectivity of influenza A virus measured by TCID(50) was maintained for 8 h on the surface of all materials, with the exception of the rubber glove for which virus infectivity was maintained for 24 h.

To this end, it is imperative to well understand the distribution of incubation times of the disease. Regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 14-days is commonly taken as a quarantine time to curb the virus spread in balancing the impacts of COVID-19 on diverse aspects of the society, including public health, economy, and humanity perspectives, etc. However, setting a sensible quarantine time is not trivial and it depends on various underlying factors. In this article, we take an angle of examining the distribution of the COVID-19 incubation time using likelihood-based methods. Our study is carried out on a dataset of 178 COVID-19 cases dated from January 20, 2020 to February 29, 2020, with the information of exposure periods and dates of symptom onset collected. To gain a good understanding of possible scenarios, we employ different models to describe incubation times of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that statistically, the 14-day quarantine time may not be long enough to control the probability of an early release of infected individuals to be small. While the size of the study data is not large enough to offer us a definitely acceptable quarantine time, and further in practice, the decision-makers may take account of other factors related to social and economic concerns to set up a practically acceptable quarantine time, our study demonstrates useful methods to determine a reasonable quarantine time from a statistical standpoint. Further, it reveals some associated complexity for fully understanding the COVID-19 incubation time distribution.

Methods A cohort study including COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tunisian national containment center was conducted. The follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated to negative RNA conversion. Results Among 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (IQR (Interquartile Range), 17–32). The shortest and longest durations were nine and 58 days, respectively. Associated factors to negative conversion of viral RNA, were symptoms such as fatigue, fever and shortness of breath (HR (Hazard Ratio): 0.600; 95% CI: 0.401-0.897) and face masks use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR: 2.006; 95%CI:1.247-3.228). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR, 16-21) when using masks vs 23 days (IQR, 17-36) without wearing masks, and 24 days (IQR, 18-36) for symptomatic patients vs 20 days (IQR, 16-30) for asymptomatic ones.

For those with a chronic, immune-related condition such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) serves to exacerbate the inflammatory burden. Serum levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a primary mediator of cell adhesion express in the inflammatory process, are often used to indicate the gravity of all inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate serum ICAM-1 levels before and after debridement in patients with DFUs who were also diagnosed as COVID-19 positive compared with those who were COVID-19 negative. METHODS: 20 patients with DFUs were screened for COVID-19 and then divided into COVID-19 positive and negative groups according to the results. Before debridement, chest x-rays and blood analysis, including ICAM-1 serum levels, were performed in both groups. Only ICAM-1 serum levels were measured after debridement. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients included in this study, 55% were male (n = 11) and 45% were female (n = 9). The mean age was 52.9 ± 1.9 years. ICAM-1 levels in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group (median 317.2 vs 149.2, respectively; p < 0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 reduced significantly in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group after debridement (median 312.5 vs 130.3; p < 0.001).

Both positive and negative modulations of viruses by BAG3 were reported. However, the effects of BAG3 on pseudorabies virus (PRV) remain unknown. To investigate whether BAG3 could modulate the PRV life cycle during a lytic infection, we first identified PRV protein UL56 (pUL56) as a novel BAG3 interactor by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses. The overexpression of pUL56 induced a significant degradation of BAG3 at protein level via the lysosome pathway. The C-terminal mutations of (181)L/A, (185)L/A, or (181)L/A-(185)L/A in pUL56 resulted in a deficiency in pUL56-induced BAG3 degradation. In addition, the pUL56 C-terminal mutants that lost Golgi retention abrogated pUL56-induced BAG3 degradation, which indicates a Golgi retention-dependent manner. Strikingly, BAG3 was not observed to be degraded in either wild-type or UL56-deleted PRV infected cells as compared to mock infected ones, whereas the additional two adjacent BAG3 cleaved products were found in the infected cells in a species-specific manner. Overexpression of BAG3 significantly suppressed PRV proliferation, while knockdown of BAG3 resulted in increased viral yields in HEK293T cells. Thus, these data indicated a negative regulation role of BAG3 during PRV lytic infection. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel molecular mechanism on host protein degradation induced by PRV pUL56. Moreover, we identified BAG3 as a host restricted protein during PRV lytic infection in cells.","Lyu, Chuang; Li, Wei-Dong; Wang, Shu-Wen; Peng, Jin-Mei; Yang, Yong-Bo; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Cai, Xue-Hui",Int J Mol Sci,256,1

Dyslipidemia is a common complication in patients with COVID-19, but the association of dyslipidemia with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is still unclear. The aim of this study is to analyze the potential association of dyslipidemia with the severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases for all relevant studies up to August 24, 2020. All the articles published were retrieved without language restriction. All analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software and Mantel–Haenszel formula with fixed effects models was used to compare the differences between studies. The Newcastle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies involving 12,995 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis, which was consisted of 26 cohort studies and 2 case–control studies. Dyslipidemia was associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.44, P = 0.038, I(2) = 39.8%). Further, patients with dyslipidemia had a 2.13-fold increased risk of death compared to patients without dyslipidemia (95% CI 1.84–2.47, P = 0.001, I(2) = 66.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The results proved that dyslipidemia is associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. Therefore, we should monitor blood lipids and administer active treatments in COVID-19 patients with dyslipidemia to reduce the severity and mortality.

The non-clinical aspects of the health system are therefore essential to the provision of services to patients. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to assess the responsiveness in maternity care, domain performance and factors associated with responsiveness in maternity care in the Hadiya Zone public Hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed on 413 participants using a systematic sampling technique from 1 July to 1 August 2020. An exit interviewer–administered questionnaire was used to collect data. EpiData (version 3.1) and SPSS (version 24) software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were computed to identify the associated factors of health system responsiveness in maternity care at 95% CI. RESULTS: The findings indicated that 53.0% of users gave high ratings for responsiveness in delivery care. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, mothers aged ≥ 35 (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1–0.9), urban resident (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.5–4.8), obstetrics complications during the current pregnancy (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1–3.0), and caesarean delivery (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2–0.7) were factors associated with poor ratings for responsiveness in maternity care. CONCLUSION: In the hospitals under investigation, responsiveness in maternity care was found to be good. The findings of this study suggest that the ministry of health and regional health bureau needs to pay attention to health system responsiveness as an indicator of the quality of maternity care.","Abdo, Ritbano Ahmed; Halil, Hassen Mosa; Kebede, Biruk Assefa; Anshebo, Abebe Alemu; Ayalew, Minychil Demelash; Nedamo, Selamu Abose; Helill, Shamill Eanga",PLoS One,256,16

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. Results: Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55–18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%). Conclusion: The high seroprevalence observed can be partially explained by the timing and the population seroprevalence; the study was conducted in an area with huge spread of the infection.","Airoldi, Chiara; Patrucco, Filippo; Milano, Fulvia; Alessi, Daniela; Sarro, Andrea; Rossi, Maicol Andrea; Cena, Tiziana; Borrè, Silvio; Faggiano, Fabrizio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,256,1

Each year, over 70,000 organs are implanted worldwide. One donor may provide multiple organs, as well as corneas and other tissues, for multiple recipients. The degree of risk for transmission of infection carried with grafts, notably of viruses, is largely unknown and, for a specific organ, difficult to assess. The approach to microbiological screening of organ donors varies with national and regional regulations and with the availability and performance of microbiological assays used for potential donors. Transmission of both expected or common, and unexpected infections has been observed in organ transplants, generally recognized after development of clusters of infections among recipients of organs from a common donor. Other than for unusual or catastrophic events, few data exist that define the incidence and manifestations of donor-derived infections or the ideal assays to use in screening to prevent such transmissions. Absolute prevention of the transmission of donor-derived infections in organ transplantation is not possible. However, improvements in screening technologies will enhance the safety of transplantation in the future.

The impact of solvent losses and emissions drives efforts to minimise them or to avoid them completely. Since the 1990s, this has become a major focus of green chemistry, giving rise to the idea of the ‘green’ solvent. This concept has generated a substantial chemical literature and has led to the development of so-called neoteric solvents. A critical overview of published material establishes that few new materials have yet found widespread use as solvents. The search for less-impacting solvents is inefficient if carried out without due regard, even at the research stage, to the particular circumstances under which solvents are to be used on the industrial scale. Wider sustainability questions, particularly the use of non-fossil sources of organic carbon in solvent manufacture, are more important than intrinsic ‘greenness’.

Using publicly available databases, deaths attributed to Covid-19 in 2020 and all deaths for the years 2015–2020 were tabulated for 35 countries together with economic, health, demographic and government response stringency index variables. Residual mortality rates (RMR) in 2020 were calculated as excess mortality minus reported mortality rates due to Covid-19 where excess deaths were observed deaths in 2020 minus the average for 2015–2019. Differences in RMR are differences not attributed to reported Covid-19. For about half the countries, RMR's were negative and for half, positive. The absolute rates in some countries were double those in others. In a regression analysis, population density and proportion of female smokers were positively associated with both Covid-19 and excess mortality while the human development index and proportion of male smokers were negatively associated with both. RMR was not associated with any of the investigated variables. The results show that published data on mortality from Covid-19 cannot be directly comparable across countries. This may be due to differences in Covid-19 death reporting and in addition, the unprecedented public health measures implemented to control the pandemic may have produced either increased or reduced excess deaths due to other diseases. Further data on cause-specific mortality is required to determine the extent to which residual mortality represents non-Covid-19 deaths and to explain differences between countries.","Kelly, Gabrielle; Petti, Stefano; Noah, Norman",Epidemiol Infect,256,26

DESIGN: Systematic review of test accuracy studies. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women’s digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. STUDY SELECTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

However, efficient utilization of pentoses by conventional yeast production strains remains challenging. Wild yeast strains can provide new industrially relevant characteristics and efficiently utilize pentose sugars. To explore this strategy, we isolated gut-residing yeasts from the termite Macrotermes bellicosus collected in Comoé National Park, Côte d´Ivoire. The yeasts were classified through their ITS/LSU sequence, their genomes were sequenced and annotated. We identified a novel yeast species, which we name Barnettozyma botsteinii sp. nov. 1118T (MycoBank: 833563, CBS 16679T and IBT 710) and two new strains of Kurtzmaniella quercitrusa: var. comoensis (CBS 16678, IBT 709) and var. filamentosus (CBS 16680, IBT 711).

Their genomes are 11.0-13.2 Mb in size and contain between 4888 and 5475 predicted genes. Together with closely related species, we did not find any relationship between gene content and ability to grow on xylose. Besides its metabolism, K. quercitrusa var. filamentosus also has a large potential as a production organism, because of its capacity to grow at low pH and to undergo a dimorphic shift.","Arrey, Gerard; Li, Guangshuo; Murphy, Robert; Guimaraes, Leandro; Alizadeh, Sefa; Poulsen, Michael; Regenberg, Birgitte",G3,256,32

Given that template copy numbers of viruses in latent infections can be very low, extremely sensitive PCR assays are needed to optimize detection efficiency. In this study, efficiency of several PCR assays designed for CFPHV detection is explored and compared to a method published previously. The results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex PCR assays outperforms other methods, with an approximately 3-fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay.

Recent studies show that several medical conditions increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and death. The increased vulnerability of the elderly and those with comorbidities, together with the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, led us to investigate the links between neurodegeneration and COVID-19. Method We analysed the health records of 13,338 UK participants from the UK Biobank, who were tested for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. We fitted binomial regressions where the response variables were, respectively, COVID-19 positivity or COVID-19-related death. In all models, we accounted for a range of comorbidities including age, gender, social deprivation, number of people in the household, etc. We deposited the full analysis script on GitHub: github.com/M1gus/AD-PD-COVID19. Results and conclusions We first investigated the association between COVID-19 and multiple chronic conditions, and show that a diagnosis of dementia is associated with the largest increase in the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 3.25;95% CI 2.73-3.87) (Figure 1A). This led us to analyse the association between dementia and COVID-19 death. We found that having dementia increases the odds of dying from COVID-19 by over 4 folds (OR 4.32;95% CI 3.33-5.60) (Figure 1B). To improve the granularity of our analysis, we looked at different subtypes of dementia and found that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, predicts a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR 4.15;95% CI 3.22-5.34) (Figure 1C) and death (OR 4.17;95% CI 2.87-6.05) (Figure 1D). This led us to look at the second most common neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD). Participants with PD were also at increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR 1.74;95% CI 1.34-2.27), but were not more likely to die from COVID-19. We conclude that there are disease-specific differences in COVID-19 susceptibility among patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders. Namely, AD increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and death, while PD only increases the risk of infection.",,Brain Neurosci Adv,256,10

The unplanned adaptation of classroom instruction to emergency distance learning was necessary to ensure continued education. In this new learning environment, teachers formed expectations for student academic achievement gains, which in turn affected the opportunities for students to learn. Parents faced new challenges in supporting their children’s learning. According to parenting stress models, such drastic events can be a stress factor for parents, which in turn affects their children’s adjustment. This study analyzed the extent to which parents and teachers affected the perceptions of students in compulsory school toward distance learning through processes at home (individual level) and at the class level with data from multiple informants. On an individual level, the relationship between parents’ perceived threat of COVID-19 and their stress due to distance learning and students’ perceived threat of COVID-19 and their perception of distance learning were examined. Students’ learning behavior was accounted for as a variable related to their perception of distance learning. At the class level, the explanatory character of teacher expectations and class-aggregated achievement gains were examined. Data on students in grades 4 to 8, parents, and teachers in Switzerland were collected with standardized online questionnaires after the period of school closures. A subsample of 539 students, 539 parents, and 83 teachers was analyzed. The results of multilevel structural equation modeling suggested that students had a more positive perception of distance learning if they were able to learn more autonomously (i.e., more motivated and concentrated than in regular classroom instruction) and if their parents felt less stressed in the distance learning setting. Parents were more stressed if they perceived COVID-19 as a threat. Students’ perception of the COVID-19 threat was related to their parents’ perception but did not explain students’ learning behavior. At the class level, if teachers expected high academic achievement gains in distance learning, the average academic achievement gains of a class were greater. The greater the achievement gains were, the more positive the collective student perception of distance learning was.","Garrote, Ariana; Niederbacher, Edith; Hofmann, Jan; Rösti, Ilona; Neuenschwander, Markus P.",Front Psychol,256,28

In the absence of appropriate antiviral drugs or vaccines, developing a simple, rapid, and reliable assay for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A novel molecular diagnosis technique, named multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, that has been linked to a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (mRT-LAMP-LFB) was applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and N genes, and the mRT-LAMP products were analyzed using nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor. The mRT-LAMP-LFB amplification conditions, including the target RNA concentration, amplification temperature, and time were optimized. The sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-LAMP-LFB method were tested in the current study, and the mRT-LAMP-LFB assay was applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus from clinical samples and artificial sputum samples. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 specific primers based on the RdRp and N genes were valid for the establishment of mRT-LAMP-LFB assay to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The multiple-RT-LAMP amplification condition was optimized at 63°C for 30 min. The full process, including reaction preparation, viral RNA extraction, RT-LAMP, and product identification, could be achieved in 80 min. The limit of detection (LoD) of the mRT-LAMP-LFB technology was 20 copies per reaction. The specificity of mRT-LAMP-LFB detection was 100%, and no cross-reactions to other respiratory pathogens were observed. CONCLUSION: The mRT-LAMP-LFB technique developed in the current study is a simple, rapid, and reliable method with great specificity and sensitivity when it comes to identifying SARS-CoV-2 virus for prevention and control of the COVID-19 disease, especially in resource-constrained regions of the world.","Chen, Xu; Zhou, Qingxue; Li, Shijun; Yan, Hao; Chang, Bingcheng; Wang, Yuexia; Dong, Shilei",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,256,7

In the settings of screening mammography, screening MRI, and diagnostic imaging workup of breast symptoms, with no imaging findings beyond unilateral axillary adenopathy ipsilateral to recent (within the past 6 weeks) vaccination, we report the adenopathy as benign with no further imaging indicated if no nodes are palpable 6 weeks after the last dose. For patients with palpable axillary adenopathy in the setting of ipsilateral recent vaccination, clinical follow-up of the axilla is recommended. In all these scenarios, axillary ultrasound is recommended if clinical concern persists 6 weeks after vaccination. In patients with a recent breast cancer diagnosis in the pre- or peritreatment setting, prompt recommended imaging is encouraged as well as vaccination (in the thigh or contralateral arm). Our recommendations align with the ACR BI-RADS Atlas and aim to reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs of unnecessary evaluation of enlarged nodes in the setting of recent vaccinations and, also, to avoid further delays in vaccinations and breast cancer screening during the pandemic.","Lehman, Constance D; Lamb, Leslie R; D039,; Alessandro, Helen Anne",AJR Am J Roentgenol,256,20

Thus, this study investigates the hospital preparedness, psychological burden, and resilience of clinical nurses in addressing COVID-19 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 281 clinical nurses participated in the survey from April 2020 to June 2020. Results show that clinical nurses perceived a high self-assessed COVID-19 hospital preparedness (49.65, SD = 2.30); high self-assessed nurses' resilience (4.03, SD = 0.36); and most have normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The variables were predicted to be statistically significant (F(18,262) = 4.14, p = 0.001) and accounted for 16.8% of the variance in the nurses' perception of hospital preparedness (R(2) = 0.221; adjusted R(2) = 0.168). The regression analysis was statistically significant (F(30,250) = 6.71, p = 0.001) and accounted for 38% of the variance in nurses' resilience (R(2) = 0.446, Adjusted R(2) = 0.380). The predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress show that the overall relationship was statistically significant at (F(23,257) = 6.71, p < 0.001), (F(23,257) = 6.675, p 0.000), and (F(23,257) = 6.692, p 0.000) with 31.9% of the variance (R(2) = 0.375, Adjusted R(2) = 0.319), 31.8% of the variance (R(2) = 0.374, Adjusted R(2) = 0.318), and 31.9 % of the variance (R(2) = 0.375, Adjusted R(2) = 0.319), respectively.

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents a computation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of various mitigation measures in the District of Columbia, USA, at various times and to various degrees. Rcode for our method is provided in the supplementry material, thereby allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions.","Sewell, Daniel K.; Miller, Aaron",PLoS One,256,20

We aimed to systematically collect key indicators in a nationally centralized blood banking system and to perform comparisons between 2020 and 2019. METHODS: Count data for January–December 2020 and 2019 were extracted from the integrated informatics system of Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service and analyzed by simple graphics, tabulations, and statistics. RESULTS: Whole blood donation activity showed a highly significant decline due to a sharp decrease in field donations by an average fall of 24% (range:17%–28%) during March–May 2020 compared to identical period of 2019. A second, more moderate decline accompanied the second wave in late fall. The simultaneous increase in institutional donations did not counterbalance this decline. Donor exclusion rates fell significantly by an average of 1,1% (range:0.9%–1.6%) in the three spring lockdown‐affected months. First‐time and repeat donors showed decreased turn‐out in larger proportions compared to highly repeat donors. Interestingly, among repeat and highly repeat donors, females showed less‐pronounced declines compared to males while this was not observed among first‐time donors. In June–September, a remarkable swing‐back was observed among highly repeat female donors. Product utilization fell most notably for RBC (mean:26.2%) but also for PLT (mean:19.8%) and FFP (mean:24.3%) and showed a full recovery in June–September followed by a second decline. CONCLUSION: Trends and reaction patterns of blood banking reported by our study may be useful in future planning and adjustments of blood banking activities.","Matusovits, Andrea; Nagy, Sándor; Baróti‐Tóth, Klára; Nacsa, János; Lázár, Mária; Marton, Imelda; Andrikovics, Hajnalka; Vokó, Zoltan; Tordai, Attila",Transfusion,256,7

The immune system develops in such a way to recognize self and non-self and develops self-tolerance against self-proteins, nucleic acids, and other larger molecules. However, the broken immunological self-tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) are expressed by immunological cells on their cell membrane and in the cytosol. Different Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nod-like receptors (NLRs) and absent in melanoma-2 (AIM-2)-like receptors (ALRs) forming inflammasomes in the cytosol, RIG (retinoic acid-inducible gene)-1-like receptors (RLRs), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are some of the PRRs. The DNA-sensing receptor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) is another PRR present in the cytosol and the nucleus. The present review describes the role of ALRs (AIM2), TLR9, and cGAS in recognizing the host cell DNA as a potent damage/danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which moves out to the cytosol from its housing organelles (nucleus and mitochondria). The introduction opens with the concept that the immune system has evolved to recognize pathogens, the idea of horror autotoxicus, and its failure due to the emergence of autoimmune diseases (ADs), and the discovery of PRRs revolutionizing immunology. The second section describes the cGAS-STING signaling pathway mediated cytosolic self-DNA recognition, its evolution, characteristics of self-DNAs activating it, and its role in different inflammatory conditions. The third section describes the role of TLR9 in recognizing self-DNA in the endolysosomes during infections depending on the self-DNA characteristics and various inflammatory diseases. The fourth section discusses about AIM2 (an ALR), which also binds cytosolic self-DNA (with 80–300 base pairs or bp) that inhibits cGAS-STING-dependent type 1 IFN generation but induces inflammation and pyroptosis during different inflammatory conditions. Hence, this trinity of PRRs has evolved to recognize self-DNA as a potential DAMP and comes into action to guard the cellular galaxy. However, their dysregulation proves dangerous to the host and leads to several inflammatory conditions, including sterile-inflammatory conditions autoinflammatory and ADs.","Kumar, Vijay",Front Immunol,256,13

However, the understanding of household secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving, and updated analysis is needed. OBJECTIVE: To use newly published data to further the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the household. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and reference lists of eligible articles were used to search for records published between October 20, 2020, and June 17, 2021. No restrictions on language, study design, time, or place of publication were applied. Studies published as preprints were included. STUDY SELECTION: Articles with original data that reported at least 2 of the following factors were included: number of household contacts with infection, total number of household contacts, and secondary attack rates among household contacts. Studies that reported household infection prevalence (which includes index cases), that tested contacts using antibody tests only, and that included populations overlapping with another included study were excluded. Search terms were SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed models to obtain SAR estimates and 95% CIs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall household SAR for SARS-CoV-2, SAR by covariates (contact age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and relationship; index case age, sex, symptom status, presence of fever, and presence of cough; number of contacts; study location; and variant), and SAR by index case identification period. RESULTS: A total of 2722 records (2710 records from database searches and 12 records from the reference lists of eligible articles) published between October 20, 2020, and June 17, 2021, were identified. Of those, 93 full-text articles reporting household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed for eligibility, and 37 studies were included. These 37 new studies were combined with 50 of the 54 studies (published through October 19, 2020) from our previous review (4 studies from Wuhan, China, were excluded because their study populations overlapped with another recent study), resulting in a total of 87 studies representing 1 249 163 household contacts from 30 countries. The estimated household SAR for all 87 studies was 18.9% (95% CI, 16.2%-22.0%). Compared with studies from January to February 2020, the SAR for studies from July 2020 to March 2021 was higher (13.4% [95% CI, 10.7%-16.7%] vs 31.1% [95% CI, 22.6%-41.1%], respectively). Results from subgroup analyses were similar to those reported in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis; however, the SAR was higher to contacts with comorbidities (3 studies; 50.0% [95% CI, 41.4%-58.6%]) compared with previous findings, and the estimated household SAR for the B.1.1.7 (α) variant was 24.5% (3 studies; 95% CI, 10.9%-46.2%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that the household remains an important site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and recent studies have higher household SAR estimates compared with the earliest reports. More transmissible variants and vaccines may be associated with further changes.","Madewell, Zachary J.; Yang, Yang; Longini, Ira M.; Halloran, M. Elizabeth; Dean, Natalie E.",JAMA Netw Open,256,30

This paper presents a prospective service evaluation during establishment of urgent dental care in the North-East of England over a six-week period. Aim: To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North-East urgent dental care service and confirm appropriate care pathways. Main Outcome Methods: Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23rd March to 3rd May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results: There were 1746 patient triages, (1595 telephone and 151 face-to-face) resulting in 1322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were: symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. 65% of clinical consultations resulted in extractions, 0.5% an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25km on average to access care, however this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and to our knowledge no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion: The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the 6-week period.

Errors made during replication that are not strongly deleterious to the virus can lead to the generation of minority variants. Here we analyzed minority variants within the SARS-CoV-2 data in 12 samples from the early outbreak in New York City, using replicate sequencing for reliable identification. While most minority variants were unique to a single sample, we found several instances of shared variants. We provide evidence that some higher-frequency minority variants may be transmitted between patients or across short transmission chains, while other lower-frequency, more widely shared variants arise independently. Further, our data indicate that even with a small transmission bottleneck, the heterogeneity of intra-host viral populations is enhanced by minority variants present in transmission samples. Our data suggest that analysis of shared minority variants could help identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that are under increased selective pressure, as well as inform transmission chains and give insight into variant strain emergence. IMPORTANCE When viruses replicate inside a host, the virus replication machinery makes mistakes. Over time, these mistakes create mutations that result in a diverse population of viruses inside the host. Mutations that are neither lethal to the virus, nor strongly beneficial, can lead to minority variants. In this study, we analyzed the minority variants in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples from New York City during the early outbreak. We found common minority variants between samples that were closely related and showed that these minority variants may be transmitted from one patient to another. We show that in general, transmission events between individuals likely contain genetically diverse viral particles, and we find signatures of selection governing intra-host evolution. We conclude that the analysis of shared minority variants can help to identify transmission events and give insight into emergence of new viral variants.","Roder, AE.; Khalfan, M.; Johnson, KEE.; Ruchnewitz, D.; Knoll, M.; Banakis, S.; Wang, W.; Samanovic, MI.; Mulligan, MJ.; Gresham, D.; Lässig, M.; Łuksza, M.; Ghedin, E.",bioRxiv,256,16

This study explored the factors and cost associated with long LOS among pediatric patient population across various PICUs and pediatric surgical cardiac intensive care units (SCICUs). METHODS: This is a multi-center concurrent mixed-methods study that was conducted in different PICUs and SCICUs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The units’ leaders were qualitatively interviewed to explore the potential factors contributing to long LOSs in PICUs and SCICUs, and deductive content analysis was used. Microcosting was utilized to estimate the inpatient costs for a sample of long-stay patients (LSPs) and the potential cost savings if those patients were transferred to step-down care units (SDUs) for those who stayed ≥60 days. RESULTS: Ten (90%) leaders of PICUs and SCICUs who were invited had participated. Changing the admission criteria, patient transfer to SDUs, family engagement in the decision-making process, and adopting a national do-not-resuscitate (DNR) policy were factors contributing to short LOSs. On the other hand, administrative constraints, staff avoidance of code status decisions, lack of palliative care resources, and complex patient characteristics were factors associated with long LOSs. The mean inpatient cost per patient was SAR 3.63 million (USD 0.97 million), and the total cost for the 48 patients was SAR 172.95 million (USD 46.12 million). CONCLUSION: If the recommendation to transfer LSPs after a 60-day PICU stay to SDUs is taken, the estimated cost savings among this sample of patients alone can be as high as SAR 109.47 million (USD 29.19 million). Therefore, future studies should examine the factors contributing to long LOSs in PICUs and SCICUs as well as the effectiveness of different policies aimed at improving the resource allocation and management using more robust study designs and diverse patient population.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Abouammoh, Noura; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; AlRuthia, Yazed; Hassounah, Marwah; Alsohime, Fahad; Alhaboob, Ali; Almazyad, Mohammed; Alabdulhafid, Majed; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alhasan, Khalid; Jamal, Amr",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,256,16

Some of these cases may be caused by the recently described human bocavirus (hBoV). The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and the potential clinical relevance of hBoV in pediatric patients. METHODS: We tested 835 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) obtained between 2002 and 2005 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases at the University of Würzburg, Germany, for the presence of hBoV DNA. The specificity of positive PCR reactions was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was found in 87 (10.3 %) of the NPAs. The median age of the infants and children with hBoV infection was 1.8 years (mean age 2.0 years; range 18 days – 8 years). Infections with hBoV were found year-round, though most occurred in the winter months. Coinfections were found in 34 (39.1 %) of the hBoV positive samples. RSV, influenza A, and adenoviruses were most frequently detected as coinfecting agents. Sequence determination of the PCR products in the NP-1 region revealed high identity (99 %) between the nucleotide sequences obtained in different years and in comparison to the Swedish viruses ST1 and ST2. An association of hBoV with a distinct respiratory tract manifestation was not apparent. CONCLUSION: HBoV is frequently found in NPAs of hospitalized infants and children with acute respiratory tract diseases. Proving the clinical relevance of hBoV is challenging, because application of some of Koch's revised postulates is not possible. Because of the high rate of coinfections with hBoV and other respiratory tract pathogens, an association between hBoV and respiratory tract diseases remains unproven.","Weissbrich, Benedikt; Neske, Florian; Schubert, Jörg; Tollmann, Franz; Blath, Katharina; Blessing, Kerstin; Kreth, Hans Wolfgang",BMC Infect Dis,256,21

The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens® Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 10(4) RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the ‘gold standard’. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens® Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical setting.","Greene, Shermalyn R; Moe, Christine L; Jaykus, Lee-Ann; Cronin, Mike; Grosso, Lynell; Aarle, Pierre van",J Virol Methods,256,23

Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.","Conti, S.; Ferrara, P.; Mazzaglia, G.; D'Orso, M.

However, existing continuum robots reach the bottleneck in actuation on account of the contradiction among small size, compliance actuation, large tender range, high precision, and small dynamic error. Herein, a 3D‐printed millimeter‐scale soft continuum robot with an ultrathin hollow skeleton wall (300 μm) and a large inner‐to‐outer ratio (0.8) is reported. After coating a thin ferromagnetic elastomer layer (≈100–150 μm), the proposed soft continuum robot equipped with hybrid actuation (tendon‐ and magnetic‐driven mode) achieves large‐angle (up to 100°) steering and high‐precision (low to 2 μm for static positioning) micromanipulation simultaneously. Specifically, the robot implements an ultralow dynamic tracking error of ≈10 μm, which is ≈30‐fold improved than the state of art. Combined with a microneedle/knife or nasopharyngeal swab, the robot reveals the potential for versatile biomedical applications, such as drug injection on the target tissue, diseased tissue ablation, and COVID‐19 nasopharyngeal sampling. The proposed millimeter‐scale soft continuum robot presents remarkable advances in large‐range and high‐precise actuation, which provides a new method for miniature continuum robot design and finds broad applications in biomedical engineering.","Zhang, Tieshan; Yang, Liu; Yang, Xiong; Tan, Rong; Lu, Haojian; Shen, Yajing",Adv Intell Syst,256,13

METHODS: We conducted a representative household-based cross-sectional serosurvey in Juba, South Sudan. We quantified IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain and estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model accounting for test performance. RESULTS: We recruited 2,214 participants from August 10 to September 11, 2020 and 22.3% had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers above levels in pre-pandemic samples. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.5% (32.1 - 46.8) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case, 104 (87-126) infections were unreported. Background antibody reactivity was higher in pre-pandemic samples from Juba compared to Boston, where the serological test was validated. The estimated proportion of the population infected ranged from 30.1% to 60.6% depending on assumptions about test performance and prevalence of clinically severe infections. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively within Juba. Validation of serological tests in sub-Saharan African populations is critical to improve our ability to use serosurveillance to understand and mitigate transmission.","Wiens, Kirsten E.; Mawien, Pinyi Nyimol; Rumunu, John; Slater, Damien; Jones, Forrest K.; Moheed, Serina; Caflish, Andrea; Bior, Bior K.; Jacob, Iboyi Amanya; Lako, Richard Lino Loro; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Baguma, Andrew; Hassen, Juma John; Baya, Sheila K.; Deng, Lul; Lessler, Justin; Demby, Maya N.; Sanchez, Vanessa; Mills, Rachel; Fraser, Clare; Charles, Richelle C.; Harris, Jason B.; Azman, Andrew S.; Wamala, Joseph F.",medRxiv,256,27

However, turning patients to prone imply important complications such as pressure ulcers. The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of prone-positioning pressure sores (PPPS) and analyze the related risk factors. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and May 2020. We enrolled 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients in critical care units with invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with pronation therapy. There were 57 cases and 17 controls. Demographic data, pronation maneuver characteristics and PPPS features were analyzed. RESULTS: In the case group, a total number of 136 PPPS were recorded. The face was the most affected region (69%). Regarding the severity, stage II was the most frequent. The main variables associated with an increased risk of PPPS were the total number of days under pronation cycles, and PP maintained for more than 24 h. The prealbumin level at admission was significantly lower in the case group. All of the ulcers were treated with dressings. The most frequent acute complication was bleeding (5%). CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, PPPS are related to the characteristics of the maneuver and the previous nutritional state. The implementation of improved positioning protocols may enhance results in critical patient caring, to avoid the scars and social stigma that these injuries entail.","Ibarra, Gorka; Rivera, Andres; Fernandez-Ibarburu, Borja; Lorca-García, Concepción; Garcia-Ruano, Angela",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,256,1
