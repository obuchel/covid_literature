3059,Incorporating health workers’ perspectives into a WHO guideline on personal protective equipment developed during an Ebola virus disease outbreak,2018-03-09,"Background: Ebola virus disease (EVD) health facility transmission can result in infection and death of health workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) supports countries in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies, which often require developing new guidance in short timelines with scarce evidence. The objective of this study was to understand frontline physicians’ and nurses’ perspectives about personal protective equipment (PPE) use during the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa and to incorporate these findings into the development process of a WHO rapid advice guideline. Methods : We surveyed frontline physicians and nurses deployed to West Africa between March and September of 2014. Results: We developed the protocol, obtained ethics approval, delivered the survey, analysed the data and presented the findings as part of the evidence-to-decision tables at the expert panel meeting where the recommendations were formulated within eight weeks. Forty-four physicians and nurses responded to the survey. They generally felt at low or extremely low risk of virus transmission with all types of PPE used. Eye protection reduced the ability to provide care, mainly due to impaired visibility because of fogging. Heat and dehydration were a major issue for 76% of the participants using goggles and for 64% using a hood. Both gowns and coveralls were associated with significant heat stress and dehydration. Most participants (59%) were very confident that they were using PPE correctly. Conclusion : Our study demonstrated that it was possible to incorporate primary data on end-users’ preferences into a rapid advice guideline for a public health emergency in difficult field conditions. Health workers perceived a balance between transmission protection and ability to care for patients effectively while wearing PPE. These findings were used by the guideline development expert panel to formulate WHO recommendations on PPE for frontline providers caring for EVD patients in outbreak conditions.","Den Boon, Saskia; Vallenas, Constanza; Ferri, Mauricio; Norris, Susan L.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820616/,388
14492,Comparison of Venous and Capillary Sampling in Oral Glucose Testing for the Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Diagnostic Accuracy Cross-Sectional Study Using Accu-Chek Inform II,2020-11-26,"The anti-melanogenic activity of essential oils of Alpinia nantoensis and their bioactive ingredients were investigated in vitro. Treatment with leaf (LEO) and rhizome (REO) essential oils of A. nantoensis, significantly reduced forskolin-induced melanin production followed by down-regulation of tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. Further studies revealed that down-regulation TYR and TRP-1 were caused by LEO/REO-mediated suppression of Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), as evidenced by reduced nuclear translocation of MITF. Also, we found that LEO/REO induce the sustained activation of ERK1/2, which facilitate subsequent proteasomal degradation of MITF, as confirmed by that LEO/REO failed to inhibits MITF activity in ERK1/2 inhibitor treated cells. In addition, a significant increase of ubiquitinated MITF was observed after treatment with LEO and REO. Furthermore, the chemical composition of LEO and REO were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) resulted that camphor, camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, isoborneol and (D)-limonene were the major compounds in both LEO and REO. Further studies revealed that α-pinene and (D)-limonene were the active components responsible for the anti-melanogenic properties of LEO and REO. Based on the results, this study provided a strong evidence that LEO and REO could be promising natural sources for the development of novel skin-whitening agents for the cosmetic purposes.","Kumar, K.

14784,A Harm Reduction Approach to Treating Opioid Use Disorder in an Independent Primary Care Practice: a Qualitative Study,2021-01-19,"PURPOSE: To assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes associated with (Clostridioides difficile infection) CDI following urological surgery, which is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea and a growing public health burden. METHODS: We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to identify patients undergoing urological surgery in 2015–2016. We evaluated the 30-day incidence and factors associated with postoperative CDI and 30-day hospital readmission and length of stay as secondary outcomes. Among the subset of patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (surgery with highest CDI incidence) we used multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate independent clinical and demographic factors associated with postoperative CDI. RESULTS: We identified 98,463 patients during the study period. The overall 30-day incidence of CDI was 0.31%, but varied considerably across surgery type. The risk of CDI was greatest following radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (2.72%) compared to all other urologic procedures (0.19%) and was associated with increased risk of hospital readmission (p < 0.0001), re-operation (p < 0.0001), and longer mean length of stay (p < 0.0001) in this cohort. Among patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, multivariable logistic regression revealed that preoperative renal failure (OR: 5.30, 95% CI 1.13–24.9, p = 0.035) and blood loss requiring transfusion (OR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.15–2.44, p = 0.0075) were independently associated with CDI. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative cohort, the incidence of CDI was low but varied substantially across surgery types. CDI was most common following radical cystectomy and associated with potentially modifiable factors such as blood transfusion and significantly longer length of stay.

14950,Impact of Longitudinal Virtual Primary Care on Diabetes Quality of Care,2021-01-22,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a worldwide problem with severe health consequences. In this study, we examine the changes in the prevalence of MetS and its components in two disadvantaged counties of Northeastern Hungary. Two health examination surveys were performed in the Hungarian population aged 20–64 years in 2006 (n = 450) and 2018 (n = 397) and the data were compared to each other. It was found that the prevalence of MetS increased significantly in the period examined (from 34.9% to 42.2%, p = 0.035) due to the increased prevalence of raised blood pressure (from 45.6% to 57.0%, p = 0.002) and raised fasting glucose concentration (13.2% vs. 24.8%, p < 0.001). The increase mainly affects the younger (20–34 years old) age group (12.1% in 2006 vs. 31.6% in 2018, p = 0.001). It is quite alarming that the prevalence of MetS and its components has increased significantly in the last decade, while the prevalence of preventive medication is unchanged (antihypertensive and antidiabetic treatments) or even significantly decreased (lipid-lowering medication). Consequently, the number of individuals untreated for hypertension and metabolic disturbances is severely increased. A targeted public health strategy is desperately needed to prevent further worsening the situation.","Piko, Peter; Dioszegi, Judit; Sandor, Janos; Adany, Roza",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829989/,388
16244,A Novel Mobile App (Heali) for Disease Treatment in Participants With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,2021-03-02,"Clinical pathways represent a multi-disciplinary approach to translate clinical practice guidelines into practical interventions. The literature from 2010 onward regarding the efficacy of adopting a clinical pathway on patient-related outcomes within the in-hospital setting has not been synthesized yet. For this reason, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to critically synthesize the literature from 2010 onward about the efficacy of clinical pathways, compared with standard of care, on patient-related outcomes in different populations and to determine the effects of clinical pathways on patient outcomes. We searched PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and reference lists of the included studies. Two independent reviewers screened the 360 identified articles and selected fifteen eligible articles, which were evaluated for content and risk of bias. Eleven studies were finally included. Given the commonalities of the measured outcomes, a meta-analysis including eight studies was performed to evaluate the effect size of the associations between clinical pathways and quality of life (OR=1.472 [0.483–4.486]; p=0.496), and two meta-analyses, including four studies, were performed to evaluate the effect sizes of the associations between clinical pathways with satisfaction (OR=2.226 [0.868–5.708]; p=0.096) and length of stay (OR=0,585 [0.349–0.982]; p=0.042). Reduced length of stay appeared to be associated with clinical pathways, while it remains unclear whether adopting clinical pathways could improve levels of quality of life and satisfaction. More primary research is required to determine in specific populations the efficacy of clinical pathways on patient-related outcomes.

17861,Rapid Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder,2021-05-28,"There is growing concern that the innovation system's ability to create wealth and attain social benefit is declining in effectiveness. This article explores the reasons for this decline and suggests a structure, the open science partnership, as one mechanism through which to slow down or reverse this decline. The article examines the empirical literature of the last century to document the decline. This literature suggests that the cost of research and innovation is increasing exponentially, that researcher productivity is declining, and, third, that these two phenomena have led to an overall flat or declining level of innovation productivity. The article then turns to three explanations for the decline – the growing complexity of science, a mismatch of incentives, and a balkanization of knowledge. Finally, the article explores the role that open science partnerships – public-private partnerships based on open access publications, open data and materials, and the avoidance of restrictive forms of intellectual property – can play in increasing the efficiency of the innovation system.","Gold, E.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known post-transcriptional gene expression regulators. However, their contribution to molecular response to hypoxia is highly dependent on cell/tissue types and causes of hypoxia. One of the most important examples is colorectal cancer, where no consensus on hypoxia-regulated miRNAs has been reached so far. In this work, we applied integrated mRNA and small RNA sequencing, followed by bioinformatics analysis, to study the landscape of hypoxia-induced miRNA and mRNA expression alterations in human colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2). A hypoxic microenvironment was chemically modeled using two different treatments: cobalt(II) chloride and oxyquinoline. Only one miRNA, hsa-miR-210-3p, was upregulated in all experimental conditions, while there were nine differentially expressed miRNAs under both treatments within the same cell line. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed a complex hypoxia-induced regulatory network: hypoxic downregulation of hsa-miR-148a-3p led to the upregulation of its two target genes, ITGA5 and PRNP, which was shown to be a factor contributing to tumor progression and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients.","Nersisyan, Stepan; Galatenko, Alexei; Chekova, Milena; Tonevitsky, Alexander",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202010/,388
18521,Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health Effects of e-Cigarette Substitution: Protocol for Two Living Systematic Reviews,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Numerous mobile apps available for download are geared toward health and fitness; however, limited research has evaluated the real-world effectiveness of such apps. The movr app is a mobile health app designed to enhance physical functioning by prescribing functional movement training based on individualized movement assessments. The influence of the movr app on functional movement and physical fitness (flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness) has not yet been established empirically. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the real-world impact of the movr app on functional movement, flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness. METHODS: A total of 48 healthy adults (24 women and 24 men; mean age 24, SD 5 years) completed an 8-week pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial in which they were randomly assigned to either 8-week use of the movr app (n=24) or 8-week waitlist control (n=24). Measures of functional movement (Functional Movement Screen [FMS]), strength (push-ups, handgrip strength, and countermovement jump), flexibility (shoulder flexibility, sit and reach, active straight leg raise [ASLR], and half-kneeling dorsiflexion), and cardiovascular fitness (maximal oxygen uptake [[Image: see text]]) were collected at baseline and the 8-week follow-up. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed significant group-by-time interactions for the 100-point FMS (P<.001), shoulder flexibility (P=.01), ASLR (P=.001), half-kneeling dorsiflexion (P<.001), and push-up tests (P=.03). Pairwise comparisons showed that FMS scores increased from pre- to postintervention for those in the movr group (P<.001) and significantly decreased for those in the control group (P=.04). For shoulder flexibility, ASLR, half-kneeling dorsiflexion, and push-up tests, improvements from pre- to postintervention were found in the movr group (all values of P<.05) but not in the control group (all values of P>.05). There were no changes in the sit and reach or handgrip strength test scores for either group (all values of P>.05). A significant main effect of time was found for the countermovement jump (P=.02), such that scores decreased from pre- to postintervention in the control group (P=.02) but not in the movr group (P=.38). Finally, a significant group-by-time interaction was found for [Image: see text] (P=.001), revealing that scores decreased pre- to postintervention in the control group (P<.001), but not in the movr group (P=.54). CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that movr improved indices of functional movement (FMS), flexibility (shoulder, ASLR, and dorsiflexion), and muscular endurance (push-ups) over an 8-week period compared with the control group while maintaining handgrip strength, lower body power (countermovement jump), and cardiovascular fitness ([Image: see text]). Thus, this study provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of the movr app for enhancing functional movement and physical fitness among healthy adults.

18524,Determining the Efficacy of Electronic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder Compared to Pharmaceutical Interventions: Protocol for a Quasi-Experimental Study,2021-05-27,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes mellitus are risk of premature death. In this study, we developed a machine learning-driven predictive risk model for all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using multiparametric approach with data from different domains. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used territory-wide data of patients with type 2 diabetes attending public hospitals or their associated ambulatory/outpatient facilities in Hong Kong between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. The association of risk variables and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Machine and deep learning approaches were used to improve overall survival prediction and were evaluated with fivefold cross validation method. RESULTS: A total of 273 678 patients (mean age: 65.4±12.7 years, male: 48.2%, median follow-up: 142 (IQR=106–142) months) were included, with 91 155 deaths occurring on follow-up (33.3%; annualized mortality rate: 3.4%/year; 2.7 million patient-years). Multivariate Cox regression found the following significant predictors of all-cause mortality: age, male gender, baseline comorbidities, anemia, mean values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG), measures of variability of both HbA1c and FBG. The above parameters were incorporated into a score-based predictive risk model that had a c-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.77), which was improved to 0.86 (0.81 to 0.90) and 0.87 (0.84 to 0.91) using random survival forests and deep survival learning models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A multiparametric model incorporating variables from different domains predicted all-cause mortality accurately in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The predictive and modeling capabilities of machine/deep learning survival analysis achieved more accurate predictions.","Lee, Sharen; Zhou, Jiandong; Leung, Keith Sai Kit; Wu, William Ka Kei; Wong, Wing Tak; Liu, Tong; Wong, Ian Chi Kei; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan; Zhang, Qingpeng; Tse, Gary",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201981/,388

METHODS: Cases were patients 28 days to 59 months of age, admitted to hospital with severe or very severe pneumonia (2005 World Health Organization definition). Community controls were frequency matched by age. Both provided nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Streptococcus pneumoniae culture. Cases underwent blood culture and induced sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A subset had pleural fluid and lung aspirates collected for culture and polymerase chain reaction. Primary analyses included participants with negative or unknown HIV status (HIV−) and cases with abnormal chest radiographs (CXR+). Cases and controls were compared using logistic regression adjusting for age. Etiologic fractions were calculated by a Bayesian nested partially latent class analysis, the PERCH integrated analysis. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2012, and January 14, 2014, we enrolled 241 CXR+/HIV− cases and 725 HIV− controls. Compared with controls, cases were more likely to have moderate-to-severe wasting (43.1% vs. 14.1%, P < 0.001) and stunting (26.6% vs. 9.4%, P < 0.001). Predominant etiologies were respiratory syncytial virus [24.0%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 18.3%–31.1%], S. pneumoniae (15.2%; 95% CrI: 9.5–21.6), human metapneumovirus (11.8%; 95% CrI: 8.3%–16.2%) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (9.0%; 95% CrI: 5.8%–13.3%). Case fatality was 13.3%, with Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Haemophilus influenzae type b predominating (40% of fatal cases). CONCLUSIONS: PERCH uncovered high case fatality among children with severe pneumonia in Mali, highlighting a role for new interventions (eg, respiratory syncytial virus vaccines) and a need to improve vaccine coverage and strengthen healthcare delivery.","Tapia, Milagritos D.; Sylla, Mamadou; Driscoll, Amanda J.; Touré, Aliou; Kourouma, Nana; Sissoko, Seydou; Tamboura, Boubou; Diakité, Abdoul Aziz; Panchalingam, Sandra; Keïta, Adama M.; Tennant, Sharon; Onwuchekwa, Uma; Roose, Anna; Deloria Knoll, Maria; Higdon, Melissa M.; Prosperi, Christine; Hammitt, Laura L.; Feikin, Daniel R.; Murdoch, David R.; O’Brien, Katherine L.; Sow, Samba O.; Kotloff, Karen L.",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448406/,388

33970,Society News,2020-06-06,"Fuzzy Logic Systems can provide a good level of interpretability and may provide a key building block as part of a growing interest in explainable AI. In practice, the level of interpretability of a given fuzzy logic system is dependent on how well its key components, namely, its rule base and its antecedent and consequent fuzzy sets are understood. The latter poses an interesting problem from an optimisation point of view – if we apply optimisation techniques to optimise the parameters of the fuzzy logic system, we may achieve better performance (e.g. prediction), however at the cost of poorer interpretability. In this paper, we build on recent work in non-singleton fuzzification which is designed to model noise and uncertainty ‘where it arises’, limiting any optimisation impact to the fuzzification stage. We explore the potential of such systems to deliver good performance in varying-noise environments by contrasting one example framework - ADONiS, with ANFIS, a traditional optimisation approach designed to tune all fuzzy sets. Within the context of time series prediction, we contrast the behaviour and performance of both approaches with a view to inform future research aimed at developing fuzzy logic systems designed to deliver both – high performance and high interpretability.","Pekaslan, Direnc; Chen, Chao; Wagner, Christian; Garibaldi, Jonathan M.",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274301/,388

50303,Benefits of Centralized e-Health System in Diabetes Care,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Radiological features of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been mainly described in adults. Available literature states that imaging findings in children are similar but less pronounced. The aim of this study is to describe and illustrate the chest computer tomography (CT) features of pediatric COVID-19. RESULTS: This retrospective study was based on the review of all the chest CTs performed in pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease between March 8th and May 26th 2020 (n = 24). The presence of comorbidities and coinfection was assessed, as well as timing of CT examination in relation to the onset of symptoms. CT findings were categorized as typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative for COVID-19 according to International Expert Consensus Statement on Chest Imaging in Pediatric COVID-19 Patient Management. This study found that CT findings were abnormal in 17 (71%) patients, with 5 (21%), 9 (38%), and 3 (13%) patients considered to have typical, indeterminate, and atypical findings, respectively. The most common CT patterns were multiple ground-glass opacities (58%), followed by consolidations (50%). Six patients showed predominantly peripheral distribution of parenchymal abnormalities. A halo sign was identified in 3 patients and a perilobular pattern was identified in one of the cases with typical findings. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be subtle or absent. Besides recognizing typical findings, radiologists should be able to identify features that favor different or concomitant diagnosis.","Pina Prata, Rita; Forjaco, Ana; Ruano, Carina A.; Lopes Dias, João; Fernandes, Lúcia; Ferreira, Alexandra; Alves, Pedro; Cabrita Carneiro, Rita; Nunes, Ana; Soares, Eugénia",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989716/,388

The optimized nanofibrous membrane for neera filtration had an average fiber diameter of 942 nm, average porosity of 73.26%, and a mean thickness of 150 µm. Results confirmed that the porosity of the membrane had a significant effect on the flow rate of permeate. The biochemical characteristics of neera filtrate were investigated. In comparison with fresh neera, the filtered counterpart had significant changes in titratable acidity, pH, and color. While no significant changes were observed in total soluble solids content, slight reductions were noted in the total polyphenolic content and minerals. Importantly, the neera filtrate obtained through the optimized nanofibrous membrane showed a 2 log-reduction in yeast load. The effective reusability of the membrane and stability of the nanofiber morphology at repeated usage was confirmed. This approach shows prospects for neera filtration while retaining nutrient content and can be extended to other natural extract applications. [Image: see text]","Leena, M. Maria; Yoha, K.

To monitor and communicate treatment results, a valid, reproducible, and clinically relevant, yet easy to use grading scheme of arterial recanalization and tissue reperfusion for digital subtraction angiography is needed. An ideal scoring system would consider the target arterial lesion, the perfusion deficit, and the collateral status before treatment and measure recanalization, reperfusion, early venous shunting, vasospasm, as well as distal embolization after flow restoration. Currently, a variety of different flow restoration scales are in use, including the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction scoring system, the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score, and the Arterial Occlusive Lesion score, which describe the local recanalization result. These scores are not used homogeneously throughout the literature, are often modified and not fully documented, which make them inept to compare treatment effects across studies. In addition, none of these scores cover all of the above-mentioned aspects, nor are they able to describe satisfactorily all relevant angiographic findings, and data on their reliability and predictive power regarding clinical outcome are sparse. We aimed to review and illustrate the different revascularization scales, discuss their advantages and limitations as well as the available data regarding standardization, reliability testing, and outcome prediction. In addition, we give examples for the use of the scales and show potential pitfalls.","Gerber, Johannes C; Miaux, Yves J; von Kummer, Rüdiger",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1460-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407716/,388

This response is thought to contribute to the pathogenicity of severe COVID-19. There is an initial weak interferon response and macrophage activation that results in delayed neutrophil recruitment leading to impeded viral clearance. This causes prolonged immune stimulation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 (i.e., D-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6) are reminiscent of ""cytokine storm"" seen in severe hyperinflammatory macrophage disorders. The dysfunctional immune response in COVID-19 also includes lymphopenia, reduced T-cells, reduced natural killer cell maturation, and unmitigated plasmablast proliferation causing aberrant immunoglobulin G levels. The progression to severe disease is accompanied by endotheliopathy, immunothrombosis, and hypercoagulability. Thus, both parts of the immune system-innate and adaptive-play a significant role in the cytokine storm, multiorgan dysfunction, and coagulopathy. This review highlights the importance of understanding the immunological mechanisms of COVID-19 as they inform the clinical presentation and advise potential therapeutic targets.","Chau, Alice S; Weber, Andrew G; Maria, Naomi I; Narain, Sonali; Liu, Audrey; Hajizadeh, Negin; Malhotra, Prashant; Bloom, Ona; Marder, Galina; Kaplan, Blanka",Arthritis & rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929876/,388
63462,International palliative care research priorities: A systematic review.,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Follow-up with MRA for intracranial aneurysms after stent-assisted coiling is complicated by imaging artifacts. We evaluated the usefulness of an alternative method: vessel wall MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of medical records of 47 patients who underwent 3D TOF-MRA, vessel wall MRI, and DSA after stent-assisted coiling between March 2016 and January 2018. We evaluated the mean value of the signal intensity in the stented artery and the contralateral normal artery on vessel wall MRI. The quality of visualization was further compared between TOF-MRA and vessel wall MRI. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and concordance rate of TOF-MRA and vessel wall MRI for assessing the patency of the stented parent artery. DSA was used as a reference test. RESULTS The mean signal intensities of the stented and normal arteries on vessel wall MRI were not significantly different (P = .133). The mean scores for the visualization of the stented parent artery on vessel wall MRI were significantly superior to those of TOF-MRA images (P < .001). Vessel wall MRI reached an excellent positive predictive value (100%). However, TOF-MRA had a poor positive predictive value (11%; 95% CI, 9%-12%). The likelihood ratios of vessel wall MRI and TOF-MRA were 27.36 (P < .001) and 2.98 (P = .225), respectively. The concordance rate of vessel wall MRI and TOF-MRA with DSA for evaluating the state of the stented artery was 100% (κ = 1) and 28% (κ = 0.038), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Vessel wall MRI may be useful in evaluating the patency of stented arteries after stent-assisted coil embolization for intracranial aneurysms.","Kim, S; Kang, M; Kim, D W; Choi, J-H",AJNR.

64395,Training residents in virtual advance care planning: A new twist in telehealth.,2021-04-02,"OBJECTIVE To conduct an online survey in order to understand neuropsychology trainees' perspectives during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify pertinent concerns, training gaps, and recommendations. METHOD A total of 874 neuropsychology trainees (81% female) completed the 69-item survey. Of the included trainees, 48% were doctoral students, 17% were interns, and 35% were postdoctoral residents (50% of resident respondents were in their first year). RESULTS The majority of neuropsychology trainees reported some impact of the pandemic on their professional and/or personal life. Overall, the impact did not differ by training level, geographic location, or demographic factors. Trainees' primary professional concerns included uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on their professional future, loss of clinical hours, and desire for increased and ongoing communication from their leadership. A notable percentage of trainees reported increased personal mental health symptoms (i.e. anxiety/depression; 74%/54%), as well as a number of other personal stressors. Despite the transition to telehealth (mostly interviews/feedback sessions), few trainees have prior training or experience in providing neuropsychological services via phone or video platform. A limited proportion of trainees (approximately 10%) were still seeing patients face-to-face for neuropsychological evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic as of 14 April 2020. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting neuropsychological training and the well-being of trainees. This survey highlights the importance of communication with trainees during uncertain times. Based on the survey results, recommendations were developed to assist neuropsychology organizations in developing initiatives to support trainees during the current pandemic and in the future.","Guidotti Breting, Leslie M; Towns, Stephanie J; Butts, Alissa M; Brett, Benjamin L; Leaffer, Emily B; Whiteside, Douglas M",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1809712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842877/,388
64797,Use of behavioural activation to manage pain: a scoping review protocol.,2021-06-03,"OBJECTIVES The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. DESIGN AND SETTING The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool was used to examine deidentified electronic health records of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. PARTICIPANTS All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7 January 2019 and 20 September 2020 (around 37 500 patients per week). OUTCOME MEASURES (i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week.(ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week. RESULTS Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared with that in the previous year (β coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased (β coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Patel, Rashmi; Irving, Jessica; Brinn, Aimee; Broadbent, Matthew; Shetty, Hitesh; Pritchard, Megan; Downs, Johnny; Stewart, Robert; Harland, Robert; McGuire, Philip",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785494/,388
65610,Primary care initiatives focused on the secondary prevention and management of chronic pain: a scoping review of the Australian literature.,2020-07-16,"The landscape of genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility has transformed dramatically over the last decade and a half. Traditionally, the process of genetic testing resided fully within a medical infrastructure, from identification of appropriate testing candidates to gene selection to risk mitigation recommendations. More recently, decreasing costs, advancing technology, and a growing understanding of therapeutic implications of certain genetic test results have led to more widespread uptake of testing that increasingly involves broad multigene panels. Germline genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility can now be obtained through one of three approaches: through clinical care; a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach that is entirely consumer-driven; or a hybrid, patient-initiated, provider-mediated model. Increased access to testing has led to extensive dialogue about the best way to conduct testing and act on results. Points of discussion include: selection of appropriate candidates for genetic testing; optimal composition of genes on panels; informed consent; safe return of results; privacy; and legal protections for those found to have relevant pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. As more individuals undergo genetic testing, a growing population of individuals with inherited breast cancer predisposition informs optimal management of cancer risk and also highlights unanswered questions. This article aims to review the current state of genetic testing for inherited breast cancer susceptibility including testing approaches, the legal, ethical and social landscape, and selected contemporary management issues.","Shah, Payal D; Domchek, Susan M",The breast journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.13968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691458/,388
65962,Chinese perspective on end-of-life communication: a systematic review.,2020-07-09,"OBJECTIVE In recent years, healthcare disaster planning has grown from its early place as an occasional consideration within the manuals of emergency medical services and emergency department managers to a rapidly growing field, which considers continuity of function, surge capability, and process changes across the spectrum of healthcare delivery. A detailed examination of critical care disaster planning was undertaken in 2007 by the Task Force for Mass Critical Care of the American College of Chest Physicians Critical Care Collaborative Initiative. We summarize the Task Force recommendations and available updated information to answer a fundamental question for critical care disaster planners: What is a prepared intensive care unit and how do I ensure my unit's readiness? DATA SOURCES Database searches and review of relevant published literature. DATA SYNTHESIS Preparedness is essential for successful response, but because intensive care units face many competing priorities, without defining ""preparedness for what,"" the task can seem overwhelming. Intensive care unit disaster planners should, therefore, along with the entire hospital, participate in a hospital or regionwide planning process to 1) identify critical care response vulnerabilities; and 2) clarify the hazards for which their community is most at risk. The process should inform a comprehensive written preparedness plan targeting the most worrisome scenarios and including specific guidance on 1) optimal use of space, equipment, and staffing for delivery of critical care to significantly increased patient volumes; 2) allocation of resources for provision of essential critical care services under conditions of absolute scarcity; 3) intensive care unit evacuation; and 4) redundant internal communication systems and means for timely data collection. CONCLUSION Critical care disaster planners have a complex, challenging task. Experienced planners will agree that no disaster response is perfect, but careful planning will enable the prepared intensive care unit to respond effectively in times of crisis.","Daugherty, Elizabeth L; Rubinson, Lewis",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3182326440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926569/,388

66182,Informatics competencies for nurse leaders: protocol for a scoping review.,2017,"The standard treatment of ovarian cancer includes upfront surgery with intent to accurately diagnose and stage the disease and to perform maximal cytoreduction, followed by chemotherapy in most cases. Surgical staging of ovarian cancer traditionally has included exploratory laparotomy with peritoneal washings, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, multiple peritoneal biopsies, and possible pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In the early 1990s, pioneers in laparoscopic surgery used minimally invasive techniques to treat gynecologic cancers, including laparoscopic staging of early ovarian cancer and primary and secondary cytoreduction in advanced and recurrent disease in selected cases. Since then, the role of minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic oncology has been continually expanding, and today advanced laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic techniques are used to evaluate and treat cervical and endometrial cancer. However, the important question about the place of the minimally invasive approach in surgical treatment of ovarian cancer remains to be evaluated and answered. Overall, the potential role of minimally invasive surgery in treatment of ovarian cancer is as follows: i) laparoscopic evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of apparent early ovarian cancer; ii) laparoscopic assessment of feasibility of upfront surgical cytoreduction to no visible disease; iii) laparoscopic debulking of advanced ovarian cancer; iv) laparoscopic reassessment in patients with complete remission after primary treatment; and v) laparoscopic assessment and cytoreduction of recurrent disease. The accurate diagnosis of suspect adnexal masses, the safety and feasibility of this surgical approach in early ovarian cancer, the promise of laparoscopy as the most accurate tool for triaging patients with advanced disease for surgery vs upfront chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and its potential in treatment of advanced cancer have been documented and therefore should be incorporated in the surgical methods of every gynecologic oncology unit and in the training programs in gynecologic oncology.","Nezhat, Farr R; Pejovic, Tanja; Finger, Tamara N; Khalil, Susan S",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2013.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24183269/,388

However, technological advances in medicine have made it possible to apply less invasive procedures in surgery. Methods Between 2006-2014, 24 patients < 18 years of age were treated for osteoid osteoma. Patient demographic data, surgical data, complications, and recurrences were noted. Results Twenty-four patients (mean age, 11 [2-18] years) were treated and followed up for a mean 3.58 (range, 1-9) years. Mean patient age in the curettage group was 12.1 (range, 3-18) years. Mean operation length was 69.5 (range, 60-120) minutes. Mean hospital stay was 1.3 (range, 0-2) days. Mean patient age in the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) group was 10.7 (range, 2-17) years. Five patients were female and 8 were male. Mean operation length was 49.6 (range, 20-90) minutes. Mean hospital stay was 0.3 (range, 0-1) days. Mean follow-up time was 1.76 (range, 1-4) years. Mean operation length, hospital stay, and follow-up were significantly shorter in the RFA group.

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related-viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion. Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and available scope for the new drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.","Kushwaha, Prem Kumar; Kumari, Neha; Nayak, Sneha; Kishor, Keshav; Sharon, Ashoke",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210514122418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992054/,388

Lymph node metastasis is extremely rare in true gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma, and there are no reports of malignant transformation from leiomyoma. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was an old woman who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection for an Is polyp on the left side of the transverse colon at the age of 73. She was diagnosed with leiomyoma with positive surgical margins. Subsequently, she presented to our institution with a sensation of pressure in the upper abdominal region as a chief complaint at the age of 76 years. Abdominal computed tomography and colorectal endoscopy showed a tumor lesion with invagination of the intestines in the transverse colon, the same site as that of the previously resected leiomyoma. A biopsy suggested a smooth muscle tumor, and we performed partial left transverse colectomy and lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of recurrence and enlargement of the previously incompletely resected leiomyoma. Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells, and the mitotic activity was 30-40/10 high-power field. Tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for α-smooth muscle actin and h-caldesmon; partially positive for desmin; negative for c-kit, CD34, DOG-1, and the S-100 protein; and showed a Ki-67 labeling index of 70-80%. She was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma malignantly transformed from leiomyoma. Metastasis was found in 1 of the 14 resected lymph nodes. The patient did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, but has survived with no recurrence at 2 years after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS We have reported a case of leiomyosarcoma of the transverse colon with lymph node metastasis that was malignantly transformed from a leiomyoma.","Tago, Tomoya; Suzuki, Shuji; Kuroda, Jun; Udou, Ryutaro; Nishida, Kiyotaka; Oshiro, Yukio; Shimazaki, Jirou; Kou, Keni; Morishita, Yukio; Shimoda, Mitsugi",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00998-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006746/,388

76336,Use of complexity theory in health and social care: a scoping review protocol.,2021-07-28,"PURPOSE The healthcare system and service capacity are overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a substantial unmet need for rehabilitation service to all patients affected by Covid-19 directly or indirectly. This article aims to describe how to rapidly reconfigure and bring rehabilitation services back during the pandemic. METHOD The Steer committee meeting was held for the development of a strategic preparedness plan and safety management based on principles and evidence of rehabilitation, which will lead to effective mitigation of consequences resulted from Covid-19. RESULTS Five measures were taken in Southwest China during the pandemic, which includes the ""First contact responsibility"" and management system; the full-coverage system for nosocomial infection control; the ""Closed-off management"" system; the full-coverage system for body temperature monitoring; the adoption of 5G-based telerehabilitation. With the implementation of these measures, the capacity and capability were enhanced to safely reopen and operate rehabilitation facilities in Southwest China. CONCLUSION Further measurement of quality of care and outcomes during and beyond the pandemic is needed in transforming the healthcare system and improving rehabilitation services. Hopefully, the positive message conveyed by this paper could encourage and support communities and the society of physical medicine and rehabilitation worldwide during this challenging time. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Rehabilitation services are essential and there is an unmet need posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. A feasible strategic plan and safety management measures are critical to reconfigure the capacity and capability of rehabilitation services suspended by Covid-19. The adoption of tele-rehabilitation technology has the potential to reshape public health emergency responses and the delivery of care. Measurement of quality and outcomes is of great importance to inform transformation and adaptation of rehabilitation services during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Zhu, Siyi; Zhang, Liming; Xie, Suhang; He, Hongchen; Wei, Quan; Du, Chunping; Yang, Yonghong; Liu, Zuoyan; He, Chengqi; Gao, Qiang; Yang, Lin",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2020.1853828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280457/,388

STUDY DESIGN Clinical, prospective study. ANIMALS Eight healthy, skeletally mature horses. METHODS In vitro-serial dilutions of CHD-EDTA-Tris and EDTA-Tris alone were evaluated for bactericidal and fungicidal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equi subspecies ssp. equi, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vivo-eight healthy horses were topically treated twice with 30 ml of 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris. Mucosal samples from each location were evaluated for the presence of inflammation or pathologic lesions. RESULTS Solutions containing CHD were superior in fungal and bacterial killing to those without. In vitro-a 0.005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was 100% effective against all bacterial and fungal species evaluated, while a 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was less efficacious against A. fumigatus and S. equi ssp. equi. In vivo-a 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris did not cause any clinical, gross, or histologic abnormalities when topically applied to the equine URT. CONCLUSIONS A 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was highly effective for killing of common bacterial and fungal isolates in the equine upper respiratory tract. Short-term topical treatment of the equine URT with dilute CHD did not cause gross or histological inflammation in the tissue. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A 0.0005% CHD solution with EDTA-Tris should be considered for treatment of clinically relevant inflammatory or infectious conditions or in the URT of the horse.","Stewart, Holly L; Engiles, Julie B; Richardson, Dean W; Levine, David G",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974283/,388
76656,Ten years of implementation outcome research: a scoping review protocol.,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND Little is known about in-stent stenosis (ISS) in patients with aneurysms treated with flow diverter (FD) stents. The reported incidence in the literature varies significantly. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, severity, distribution, clinical significance, and possible predictors for ISS. METHODS Between July 2012 and June 2016 we retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with SILK FDs in our center. Only cases with short-term (4±2 months) and long-term (>1 year) follow-ups with digital subtraction angiograms were included. ISS was graded as mild (<25%), moderate (25-50%) or severe (>50%). The following predictors for ISS were assessed: gender, age, the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm size, location, occlusion status, and post-stenting angioplasty. RESULTS Thirty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. At mid-term follow-up, ISS was observed in 16/36 patients (44%). Eleven patients (69%) had mild ISS, three (19%) moderate, and two (12%) severe ISS. ISS was diffuse in 11 patients (69%) and focal in five patients (31%). All patients were asymptomatic. Thirteen patients were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy and three on aspirin alone. At long-term follow-up, complete ISS resolution was seen in 11 patients, improvement in three and worsening in two patients. No de novo ISS occurrence was observed. On univariate analysis there was no significant predictor for ISS. CONCLUSIONS Transient ISS after FD deployment is a common asymptomatic finding on mid-term angiographic follow-up. Complete resolution or improvement at long-term follow-up is seen in most patients who are maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy.","Essbaiheen, Fahad; AlQahtani, Hanan; Almansoori, Taleb Mohamed; Cora, Elena Adela; Patro, Satya; Tsehmaister-Abitbul, Vered; Drake, Brian; Lesiuk, Howard; Finitsis, Stephanos Nikolaos; Iancu, Daniela",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-013928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194108/,388
76841,Multidisciplinary community paediatric video appointments during COVID-19 pandemic: descriptive study.,2020-09-10,"CD13 is a large cell surface peptidase expressed on the monocytes and activated endothelial cells that is important for homing to and resolving the damaged tissue at sites of injury. We showed previously that cross-linking of human monocytic CD13 with activating Abs induces strong adhesion to endothelial cells in a tyrosine kinase- and microtubule-dependent manner. In the current study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations in vitro and in vivo. We found that cross-linking of CD13 on U937 monocytic cells induced phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including Src, FAK, and ERK, and inhibition of these abrogated CD13-dependent adhesion. We found that CD13 itself was phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner, which was an unexpected finding because its 7-aa cytoplasmic tail was assumed to be inert. Furthermore, CD13 was constitutively associated with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, and CD13 cross-linking induced complex formation with the actin-binding protein α-actinin, linking membrane-bound CD13 to the cytoskeleton, further supporting CD13 as an inflammatory adhesion molecule. Mechanistically, mutation of the conserved CD13 cytoplasmic tyrosine to phenylalanine abrogated adhesion; Src, FAK, and ERK phosphorylation; and cytoskeletal alterations upon Ab cross-linking. Finally, CD13 was phosphorylated in isolated murine inflammatory peritoneal exudate cells, and adoptive transfer of monocytic cell lines engineered to express the mutant CD13 were severely impaired in their ability to migrate into the inflamed peritoneum, confirming that CD13 phosphorylation is relevant to inflammatory cell trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this study identifies CD13 as a novel, direct activator of intracellular signaling pathways in pathophysiological conditions.","Subramani, Jaganathan; Ghosh, Mallika; Rahman, M Mamunur; Caromile, Leslie A; Gerber, Claire; Rezaul, Karim; Han, David K; Shapiro, Linda H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1301348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23997214/,388
76873,Lessons learnt transitioning to a digital conference during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-20,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to present our experience in the management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease (MMD), and to discuss their treatment strategies and the timing of revascularization surgery.Patients and methods: Thirteen patients who had ruptured intracranial aneurysms associated with MMD were enrolled in this study. Different treatment strategies were adopted based on the location of the aneurysms. Their clinical and radiologic features, treatment selection and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.Results: Among the five patients with major artery aneurysms in anterior circulation, three were embolized and two clipped. Among the five patients with major artery aneurysms in posterior circulation, three were treated by endovascular coiling. Among the three peripheral aneurysms, one was treated by endovascular embolization, one by aneurysmectomy, and the other one by revascularization alone. For the patients whose aneurysms were treated by endovascular embolization or surgery, a staged revascularization was performed on day 28 to day 87 after the first operation. For the two patients with aneurysms untreated directly, the timing of revascularization was 20 days and 54 days after hemorrhage, respectively. During the follow-up recurrent intracranial hemorrhage occurred in a patient, but not caused by the previous aneurysm. No other patients suffered recurrent intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke. Complete occlusion was achieved in all the 11 aneurysms that had been clipped or embolized. Of the remaining three aneurysms that had not been directly treated, one disappeared spontaneously, whereas the other two remained stable. The direct and indirect bypasses were confirmed patent in the 11 patients who had undergone revascularization.Conclusion: Our current treatment strategies and timing of revascularization may provide a benefit for the patients with MMD accompanied by ruptured intracranial aneurysms.","Zhao, Xu; Wang, Xiaofei; Wang, Minqing; Meng, Qinghu; Wang, Chengwei",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2020.1781058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567379/,388
77195,Development and use of mobile messaging for individuals with musculoskeletal pain conditions: a scoping review protocol.,2021-07-12,"This study aimed at reporting our first experience with robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy (R-LESS-RP) with single-site VesPa platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). A 68-year-old-man presenting with a cT1c adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7 in 4/12 bilateral cores underwent a transperitoneal robotic LESS-RP with a single-site Vespa platform. Initial PSA, prostate weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 4.4 ng/ml, 45 g, and 25, respectively. Instruments and camera cross within the Single-Site port; the da Vinci System software detects and reassigns the user's hands with the instruments position. The single-site port is inserted through a 2-cm intraumbilical incision. The robotic 8.5 mm scope and two surgical curved instruments (fenestrated bipolar forceps and cautery hook) are introduced through the ports and used for most of the procedure, whereas a wristed needle driver on the right hand is used for the reconstructive steps. An additional 12 mm port (Air Seal, SurgiQuest) is placed in a midline between the umbilicus and the right iliac spine in order to facilitate table assistance during surgery and to place a drain at the end of the procedure.Operative time and blood loss were 300 min and 400 mL, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. The drain and the catheter were removed on days 1 and 6, respectively. The patient experienced a temporary mild stress incontinence (one pad at sixth month) and erectile dysfunction.Our first robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy (R-LESS-RP) with the single-site VesPa platform was associated with acceptable operative times and perioperative outcome. This procedure is feasible without complications, provided that a proper patient selection has occurred. Limited movements together with the lack of the fourth robotic arm require a considerable expertise in robotic surgery. Some tricks can help overcome technical limitations. The Robotic LESS-RP reduces in some measure the limitations of conventional LESS RP, although further refinement of the robotic instruments is necessary.","Mattevi, D; Luciani, L G; Vattovani, V; Chiodini, S; Puglisi, M; Malossini, G",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-017-0724-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28688033/,388
77462,Risk of COVID-19 infection in workplace settings and the use of personal protective equipment.,2020-06-16,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review compares the clinical features, laboratory aspects and treatment options of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). RECENT FINDINGS Bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) and are likely the reservoir of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although a small number of camels have been found to have positive nasal swabs by real-time polymerase chain reaction and to carry antibody against MERS-CoV, the transmission route and the intermediary animal source remain uncertain amongst the sporadic primary cases. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure and extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea, whereas mild or asymptomatic cases also occur in both conditions. In comparison with SARS, patients with MERS are older with male predominance, more comorbid illness and relatively lower human-to-human transmission potential. Although the viral kinetics of MERS-CoV remain unknown, nosocomial infections of MERS occur early within the first week of illness of the index case, whereas those of SARS occurred mainly in the second week of illness when the patient's upper airway viral load peaks on day 10 of illness. In-vitro data suggest that interferon (IFN) with or without ribavirin and mycophenolic acid may inhibit MERS-CoV, whereas protease inhibitors and IFN have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. SUMMARY Although there are some similarities in the clinical features, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly than SARS. The higher case fatality rate of MERS is likely related to older age and comorbid illness. More studies are needed to understand MERS-CoV in order to guide public health infection control measures and treatment.","Hui, David S; Memish, Ziad A; Zumla, Alimuddin",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626235/,388
77614,The impact of lockdown on sleep patterns of children and adolescents with ADHD.,2021-04-01,"We propose a mathematically straightforward method to infer the incidence curve of an epidemic from a recorded daily death curve and time-to-death distribution; the method is based on the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution scheme from optics. We apply the method to reconstruct the incidence curves for the 1918 influenza epidemic in Philadelphia and New York State. The incidence curves are then used to estimate epidemiological quantities, such as daily reproductive numbers and infectivity ratios. We found that during a brief period before the official control measures were implemented in Philadelphia, the drop in the daily number of new infections due to an average infector was much larger than expected from the depletion of susceptibles during that period; this finding was subjected to extensive sensitivity analysis. Combining this with recorded evidence about public behavior, we conclude that public awareness and change in behavior is likely to have had a major role in the slowdown of the epidemic even in a city whose response to the 1918 influenza epidemic is considered to have been among the worst in the U.S.","Goldstein, Edward; Dushoff, Jonathan; Ma, Junling; Plotkin, Joshua B; Earn, David J D; Lipsitch, Marc",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0902958106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080801/,388

Objectives The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population. Methods Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. Results A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death. Conclusions Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital. On the other hand, osteoporotic hip fractures have not varied in their incidence and a decrease in the average postoperative and overall stay has been observed.","González-Martín, D; Álvarez-De la Cruz, J; Martín-Vélez, P; Boluda-Mengod, J; Pais-Brito, J L; Herrera-Pérez, M",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.recot.2020.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630777/,388

It has been chemically synthesized and used in diseases where the immune system is hindered or malfunctioning. AREAS COVERED Many clinical trials investigate the Ta1 effects in patients with cancer, infectious diseases and as a vaccine enhancer. The number of diseases that could benefit from Ta1 treatment is increasing. To date, questions remain about the physiological basal levels of Ta1 and the most effective dose and schedule of treatment. Evidence is growing that diseases characterized by deregulation of immune and/or inflammatory responses are associated with serum levels of Ta1 significantly lower than those of healthy individuals: to date, B hepatitis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis and sepsis. The sputum of cystic fibrosis patients contains lower levels of Ta1 than healthy controls. These data are consistent with the role of Ta1 as a regulator of immunity, tolerance and inflammation. EXPERT OPINION Low serum Ta1 levels are predictive and/or associated with different pathological conditions. In case of Ta1 treatment, it is crucial to know the patient's baseline serum Ta1 level to establish effective treatment protocols and monitor their effectiveness over time.","Pica, Francesca; Gaziano, Roberta; Casalinuovo, Ida Antonia; Moroni, Gabriella; Buè, Cristina; Limongi, Dolores; D'Agostini, Cartesio; Tomino, Carlo; Perricone, Roberto; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Sinibaldi Vallebona, Paola; Garaci, Enrico",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2018.1474197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063864/,388

80636,Insomnia Burden and Future Perspectives.,2021-09-01,"INTRODUCTION High-quality evidence regarding questions of diagnostic accuracy relies on transparent reporting of study results. The quality of reporting for such studies in the urologic literature is unknown. METHODS In accordance with an a priori protocol, we systematically searched for all articles on diagnostic accuracy studies published in four major urologic journals in 2015. Using the 2015 STAndards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) checklist, two of us independently abstracted data. For each article, we calculated STARD summary scores (scale of 0-30, with higher scores reflecting higher-quality reporting). We compared scores by journal, topic, and sample size. RESULTS We screened 819 references of which 61 met inclusion criteria. Nearly two-thirds of studies (39/61%; 63.9%) addressed prostate cancer diagnosis or staging; less than one in ten (6/61%; 9.8%) was conducted in non-oncological disease settings. The major focus for the investigation of new index tests lay in imaging modalities (33/61%; 54.1%); over half of these imaging studies addressed magnetic resonance imaging (18/61%; 29.5%). The average STARD score was 18.9 ± 2.4 (range 12-24). Six criteria had poor reporting compliance and were met by less than 20% of studies. We found no association between reporting quality and topic, journal or study size. CONCLUSIONS The reporting quality of studies of diagnostic accuracy appears modest and independent of topic, journal or study size. There is an urgent need for greater awareness for the reporting quality of these studies among readers, editors, and investigators to raise evidentiary standards on issues of diagnosis.","Smith, Daniel W; Gandhi, Shreyas; Dahm, Philipp",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-018-2446-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30140946/,388

Comparing Resident Knowledge and Self-Efficacy to Published Palliative Care Competencies.,2020-09-03,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the predictive value of the maximal inspiratory pressure obtained by a digital vacuometer using a unidirectional valve (P(ImaxUV)) as to weaning outcome, and to compare its performance with the respiratory drive using airway occlusion pressure at 0.1 second (P(0.1)), and P(0.1)/P(ImaxUV). METHODS Patients on mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours who fulfilled the weaning criteria were prospectively enrolled. Measurements of P(ImaxUV) and P(0.1) were accomplished with a digital vacuometer with a unidirectional valve that allows only exhalation. Measured values were electronically recorded and stored on the digital vacuometer measurement device. Cutoff points for the used parameters were: absolute values of P(ImaxUV) > 30 cm H(2)O, P(0.1) < 2.3 cm H(2)O, and P(0.1)/P(ImaxUV) < 0.10. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to compare the predictive values of the indexes. RESULTS One hundred three subjects completed the test. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.79 ± 0.04, 0.65 ± 0.05, and 0.74 ± 0.04 for P(ImaxUV), P(0.1), and P(0.1)/P(ImaxUV), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for P(ImaxUV) was higher than for P(0.1) and P(0.1)/P(ImaxUV), but statistical significance was only found against P(0.1) (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS Every studied index had only a modest performance regarding prediction of weaning outcome. Of note, P(ImaxUV) values obtained by digital technology using a unidirectional valve performed better than historically reported using a conventional techniques, surpassing P(0.1) and P(0.1)/P(ImaxUV) in this regard.","de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; da Silva, Cyro Teixeira; Almeida, Jorge Reis; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348530/,388

Monte Carlo-based 3D dosimetry integrating time-activity curves in VOI was performed on 111In-OTSA101 repeated SPECT/CT. Estimated absorbed doses (AD) in normal tissues were compared to biological side effects and to the admitted maximal tolerated absorbed dose (MTD) in normal organs. Results in the tumors were also compared to disease evolution. RESULTS Biodistribution and tracer quantification were analyzed on repeated SPECT/CT acquisitions performed after injection of 111In-OTSA101 in 19/20 included patients. SPECT images were warped to a common coordinates system with deformable registration. Volumes of interest (VOI) for various lesions and normal tissues were drawn on the first CT acquisition and reported to all the SPECT images. Tracer quantification and residence time of 111In-OTSA101 in VOI were used to evaluate the estimated absorbed doses per MBq of 90Y-OTSA101 by means of Monte Carlo simulations (GATE). A visual scale analysis was applied to assess tumor uptake (grades 0 to 4) and results were compared to the automated quantification. Results were then compared to biological side effects reported in the selected patients treated with 90Y-OTSA101 but also to disease response to treatment. After screening, 8/20 patients were treated with 370 or 1110 MBq 90Y-OTSA101. All demonstrated medullary toxicity, only one presented with transient grade 3 liver toxicity due to disease progression, and two patients presented with transient grade 1 renal toxicity. Median absorbed doses were the highest in the liver (median, 0.64 cGy/MBq; [0.27 -1.07]) being far lower than the 20 Gy liver MTD, and the lowest in bone marrow (median, 0.09 cGy/MBq; [0.02 -0.18]) being closer to the 2 Gy bone marrow MTD. Most of the patients demonstrated progressive disease on RECIST criteria during patient follow-up. 111In-OTSA101 tumors tracer uptake visually appeared highly heterogeneous in inter- and intra-patient analyses, independently of tumor sizes, with variable kinetics. The majority of visual grades corresponded to the automated computed ones. Estimated absorbed doses in the 95 supra-centimetric selected lesions ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 cGy per injected MBq (median, 0.22 cGy/MBq). The maximal tumor AD obtained was 11.5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS 3D dosimetry results can explain the observed toxicity and tumors response.

83288,Contamination of Health Care Personnel During Removal of Personal Protective Equipment.,2015,"INTRODUCTION In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","Margus, Colton; Sarin, Ritu R; Molloy, Michael; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20001089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907650/,388

In the present study, the pathogenicity of three AvCoV isolates was investigated in day-old chicks. One AvCoV isolated from a pigeon, which clustered with the Massachusetts vaccine serotype, and two AvCoV isolated from chickens, which grouped with a Brazilian genotype lineage, were used. Clinical signs, gross lesions, histopathological changes, ciliary activity, viral RNA detection, and serology were evaluated during 42 days post infection. All AvCoV isolates induced clinical signs, gross lesions in the trachea, moderate histopathological changes in the respiratory tract, and mild changes in other tissues. AvCoV isolated from the pigeon sample caused complete tracheal ciliostasis over a longer time span. Specific viral RNA was detected in all tissues, but the highest RNA loads were detected in the digestive tract (cloacal swabs and ileum). The highest antibody levels were also detected in the group infected with an isolate from the pigeon. These results confirm the pathogenicity of Brazilian variants, which can cause disease and induce gross lesions and histopathological changes in chickens. Our results suggest that non-Galliformes birds can also play a role in the ecology of AvCoV.","Martini, Matheus C; Caserta, Leonardo C; Dos Santos, Marcia M A B; Barnabé, Ana C S; Durães-Carvalho, Ricardo; Padilla, Marina A; Simão, Raphael M; Rizotto, Laís S; Simas, Paulo V M; Bastos, Juliana C S; Cardoso, Tereza C; Felippe, Paulo A N; Ferreira, Helena L; Arns, Clarice W",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2018.1442557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517348/,388

Successful aerosol delivery during invasive mechanical ventilation requires careful consideration of a host of factors that influence the amount of drug inhaled by the patient. Pressurized metered-dose inhalers and nebulizers (jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating mesh) are the most commonly used aerosol delivery devices in these patients, although other delivery devices, such as dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, and intratracheal nebulizing catheters, could also be adapted for in-line use. Bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, antibiotics, pulmonary surfactant, mucolytics, biologicals, genes, prostanoids, and other agents are administered by inhalation during mechanical ventilation for a variety of indications. The goals of inhalation therapy during mechanical ventilation could be best achieved by (1) assuring drug delivery; (2) optimizing drug deposition in the lung; (3) providing consistent dosing; (4) avoiding inappropriate therapies; (5) achieving reproducible dosing; (6) employing clinically feasible methods; (7) enhancing the safety of inhaled drugs; and (8) controlling costs of aerosol therapy. The techniques of administration of aerosols with various delivery devices during mechanical ventilation are well known, but there continues to be significant variation in clinical practice and guidelines are needed to provide best practices for a wide range of clinical settings encountered in mechanically ventilated patients.","Dhand, Rajiv",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874611/,388
88818,Palliative care: Experts call for major reforms as pandemic accelerates demand by 20 years.,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND ProCore fine-needle biopsy (FNB) was introduced to improve the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sampling. The aim of this study was to evaluate EUS-guided sampling of intra-abdominal masses and compare the diagnostic utility of conventional EUS-FNA and ProCore FNB. METHODS EUS-guided biopsy samples (FNA and/or EchoTip ProCore FNB) were retrospectively retrieved over the course of 23 months. Clinical findings, pathology reports, and available histological materials were reviewed. All cell blocks were reviewed, and their cellularity was scored (range, 0-3). RESULTS Fifty-six masses from 58 cases were acquired, and they included 40 pancreatic sites and 16 other intra-abdominal sites. Among the 31 FNB-only cases, 71% were satisfactory, 65% were positive for malignancy at the time of final diagnosis, and their cell blocks were moderately cellular. For the cases with both FNB and FNA performed, more FNB samples than FNA samples were satisfactory (83% vs 76%) and were positive for malignancy (65% vs 48%) at final diagnosis, and the former had more cellular cell blocks (mean score, 1.58 vs 1.29); however, the differences were not statistically significant. Significantly more FNB samples were used for immunostains (48% vs 10%; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS These data show that a wide variety of intra-abdominal masses were amenable to sampling by ProCore FNB. In this subset of cases with prior/concurrent indeterminate FNAs, FNB showed slightly better diagnostic yield, and had more cellular tissue samples and more material for ancillary studies than matched FNAs.","Dwyer, Jessica; Pantanowitz, Liron; Ohori, N Paul; Pai, Reetesh K; Vrbin, Colleen; Brand, Randall E; Monaco, Sara E",Cancer cytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncy.21623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430767/,388
89191,Trajectory of psychosocial symptoms among home care patients with cancer at end-of-life.,2020-10-02,"OBJECTIVE Most of the research on vasovagal reactions has focused on the contributions of cardiovascular activity to the development of symptoms. However, other research suggests that additional mechanisms like hyperventilation may contribute to the process. The goal of the present investigation was to examine the influences of cardiovascular and respiratory variables on vasovagal symptoms. METHODS This study was part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of behavioral techniques on the prevention of vasovagal reactions in blood donors. Data from the no-treatment control group were analyzed. The final sample was composed of 160 college and university students. Observational and self-report measures of symptoms were obtained. Physiological variables were measured mainly using respiratory capnometry. RESULTS While respiration rate remained stable throughout donation, change in end-tidal CO2 was associated with requiring treatment for a reaction during donation (OR = .57, 95% CI = .41-.79, p = .001) and self-reported symptoms measured in the post-donation period using the Blood Donation Reactions Inventory (β=-.152, 95% CI= -.28- -.02, t=-2.32, p=.022). Individuals with higher levels of pre-donation anxiety displayed larger decreases in end-tidal CO2 throughout the procedure (F(2,236) = 3.64, p = .043, ηp = .030). BDRI scores were related to changes in systolic (β=-.022, 95% CI= -.04- -.004, t=-2.39, p=.019) and diastolic blood pressure (β=-.038, 95% CI= -.06- -.02, t=-4.03, p <.001). CONCLUSIONS While the vasovagal reaction has traditionally been viewed as a primarily cardiovascular event, the present results suggest that hyperventilation also plays a role in the development of vasovagal symptoms.","Mennitto, Serena; Ritz, Thomas; Robillard, Pierre; France, Christopher R; Ditto, Blaine",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176193/,388

While we change our surgical practice, cancer care will take a toll on unprecedented long-term outcomes. We elucidate our experience that has unfolded during this period. METHODS This study included retrospective data of patients being treated for colorectal cancer and peritoneal surface malignancy between January and May 2020. We compared the treatment changes before and after the national emergency was declared. RESULTS There was a 65% decrease in outpatients with a 90% drop in endoscopy procedures. Treatment protocols were changed with a 200% increase in short course radiation in rectal cancer. Colon cancer and anal melanoma were triaged to undergo 'essential' surgery. No robotic or exenteration procedures were performed in April and May. Patients with a low peritoneal cancer index underwent surgery alone. The relative number of emergency surgeries were unchanged. CONCLUSION There is no standard approach to deliver cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Treatment decisions were made based on the state of affairs that COVID-19 had created during that cross-section of time and protocols were redrawn to strike a balance between the risk of death from colorectal cancer and the risk of death from COVID-19 infection.","Raj Kumar, Barath; Pandey, Diwakar; Rohila, Jitender; deSouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885429/,388

To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across five countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.","Brat, Gabriel A; Weber, Griffin M; Gehlenborg, Nils; Avillach, Paul; Palmer, Nathan P; Chiovato, Luca; Cimino, James; Waitman, Lemuel R; Omenn, Gilbert S; Malovini, Alberto; Moore, Jason H; Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K; Tibollo, Valentina; Murphy, Shawn N; Yi, Sehi L'; Keller, Mark S; Bellazzi, Riccardo; Hanauer, David A; Serret-Larmande, Arnaud; Gutierrez-Sacristan, Alba; Holmes, John J; Bell, Douglas S; Mandl, Kenneth D; Follett, Robert W; Klann, Jeffrey G; Murad, Douglas A; Scudeller, Luigia; Bucalo, Mauro; Kirchoff, Katie; Craig, Jean; Obeid, Jihad; Jouhet, Vianney; Griffier, Romain; Cossin, Sebastien; Moal, Bertrand; Patel, Lav P; Bellasi, Antonio; Prokosch, Hans U; Kraska, Detlef; Sliz, Piotr; Tan, Amelia L M; Ngiam, Kee Yuan; Zambelli, Alberto; Mowery, Danielle L; Schiver, Emily; Devkota, Batsal; Bradford, Robert L; Daniar, Mohamad; Daniel, Christel; Benoit, Vincent; Bey, Romain; Paris, Nicolas; Serre, Patricia; Orlova, Nina; Dubiel, Julien; Hilka, Martin; Jannot, Anne Sophie; Breant, Stephane; Leblanc, Judith; Griffon, Nicolas; Burgun, Anita; Bernaux, Melodie; Sandrin, Arnaud; Salamanca, Elisa; Cormont, Sylvie; Ganslandt, Thomas; Gradinger, Tobias; Champ, Julien; Boeker, Martin; Martel, Patricia; Esteve, Loic; Gramfort, Alexandre; Grisel, Olivier; Leprovost, Damien; Moreau, Thomas; Varoquaux, Gael; Vie, Jill-Jênn; Wassermann, Demian; Mensch, Arthur; Caucheteux, Charlotte; Haverkamp, Christian; Lemaitre, Guillaume; Bosari, Silvano; Krantz, Ian D; South, Andrew; Cai, Tianxi; Kohane, Isaac S",NPJ digital medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-00308-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864472/,388

92943,COVID-19 impact on anxiety and depression in head and neck cancer patients: a cross-sectional study.,2021-04-14,"The idea of a network of small devices that would be able to connect each other, appeared in the early 80s. In a prophetic article, Mark Weiser,1 described such a connection, that it is now known under the term of Internet of Things (IoT). In a broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that ""talk"" to each other, creating a network from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables connected. During the recent years this network of communicating devices has been combined with other technological achievements, and particularly with the Virtual Reality (VR)2 and the Artificial Intelligence (AI).3 The emerge of COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, resulted to the poor response and healthcare failures of many countries globally.4 One of the main reasons for such a failure, was the inability of accurate data collection from different sources. Apparently, it was the first time, humanity realized the need for massive amounts of heterogeneous data to be collected, interpreted, and shared. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several innovators and public authorities are looking to leverage IoT tools to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems.5 Mental health is one of the areas that seems to benefit the most of such technologies. A significant decrease of the total amount of ER visits and a dramatic increase of internet access from the patients and care givers along to the development of applications for mental health issues, followed the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.6 Such technologies proved to be efficient to help mentally ill patients and pioneer the path in the future. Probably the most obvious use of these emerged technologies is the improvement of the telehealth options. Patients who suffer from mental illness face significant problems towards the continuity of care during the crisis.7 Nonetheless, they usually have other health problems, that deprive them from an equitable health care provision. Improved telehealth platforms can give them a single point access to address all their problems. The use of electronic health records can reduce the fragmentary health services and improve the outcome.8 However, this is only the beginning. The COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent social isolation, to reduce both the contamination and the spread of the disease, highlighted the necessity for providing accurate and secure diagnoses and treatments from a safe distance. Virtual reality combined with IoT and AI technologies seem to be a reliable alternative to the classic physical and mental examination and treatment in many areas of mental and neurological diseases.2 These novel techniques can spot the early signs and detect mental illnesses with high accuracy. However, caution and more work are required to bridge the space between these recently thrived technologies and mental health care.7 It is worth mentioning, that internet-oriented health care procedures can also help to reduce the gaps caused by the stigma of mental illness. For example, the development of AI chatbots (an application used to chat directly with a human) can alleviate the fears of judgment of the help seeking persons and provide the professionals with a supplemental support toward improved services to their patients.9 A final remark for conclusion. Humanity is more and more depended to the ""intelligent"" machines. However, we must not forget that we humans are responsible to set the rules of such co-existence.","Alevizopoulos, Aristomenis; Kritikos, Jacob; Alevizopoulos, Georgios",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2021.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34052787/,388

93524,Coronavirus pandemic: compassionate communities and information technology.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Respiratory viruses are the main cause of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is highly practicable for the rapid detection of viral pathogens. The simultaneous detection of a broad spectrum of viruses enables the diagnosis and evaluation of viral coinfection in ARI. METHODS A 1-step real-time PCR was developed for the detection of 12 respiratory viruses (10 RNA and 2 DNA viruses) in clinical samples. Clinical samples from 254 children admitted to the Departments of Pediatrics with ARI during a 10-month period were tested. RESULTS Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected pathogen in 112 samples (44.1%), followed by human bocavirus (hBoV) in 49 (19.3%), and rhinovirus in 17 samples (6.7%). Viral coinfection was detected in 41 (16.1%) samples with RSV and hBoV being the most dominating combination (27 cases, 10.6%). Viral coinfection was found in 10 cases (17%) of children with bronchitis (n = 58) and in 7 cases (23%) of bronchiolitis (n = 30). In patients with pneumonia (n = 51), 17 cases (33%) were positive for 2 or more viral pathogens. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous testing of respiratory viruses by real-time PCR is a suitable tool for the detection of viral coinfections.

94801,"Respiratory Protective Equipment for Healthcare Providers During Coronavirus Pandemic: ""Nec Temere, Nec Timide"".",2020-12-01,"An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus. The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.","Basta, Giuseppina; Del Turco, Serena; Caselli, Chiara; Melani, Luca; Vianello, Annamaria",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3347.33187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319446/,388

METHODS Acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion on computed tomographic angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast computed tomography and magnectic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging between 24 and 48 hours were used to delineate follow-up infarction. Reperfusion was assessed on conventional angiogram or 4-hour repeat computed tomographic angiography. Tmax, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing were analyzed using receiver-operator characteristic curves to derive optimal thresholds for combined patient data (pooled analysis) and individual patients (patient-level analysis) based on time from stroke onset-to-CTP and CTP-to-reperfusion. One-way ANOVA and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression was used to test whether the derived optimal CTP thresholds were different by time. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-two patients were included. Tmax thresholds of >16.2 and >15.8 s and absolute cerebral blood flow thresholds of <8.9 and <7.4 mL·min(-1)·100 g(-1) were associated with infarct if reperfused <90 min from CTP with onset <180 min. The discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. No statistically significant relationship was noted between stroke onset-to-CTP time and the optimal CTP thresholds for all parameters based on discrete or continuous time analysis (P>0.05). A statistically significant relationship existed between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the optimal thresholds for cerebral blood flow (P<0.001; r=0.59 and 0.77 for gray and white matter, respectively) and Tmax (P<0.001; r=-0.68 and -0.60 for gray and white matter, respectively) parameters.

Although weight loss is known to reduce inflammation, the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery on microparticle concentration and composition are not known. Our objectives were to determine the effect of bariatric surgery on the microparticle concentration and to correlate these changes with clinical parameters in a multispecialty group practice. METHODS We studied 14 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2 weeks before and 1 and 12 months after bariatric surgery. Of the 14 patients, 9 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 5 gastric restrictive surgery. RESULTS At 1 month after surgery, the body mass index had decreased by ∼10%, glycemic control had improved dramatically (P < .01), and a >60% reduction in endothelial and platelet microparticles and C-reactive protein levels (P < .05) had occurred. The tissue factor microparticles had decreased by 40% (P = .1). At 12 months after surgery, the body mass index had decreased by ∼20%, glycemic control was maintained (P < .01), and a >50% reduction in monocyte microparticles compared with before surgery was found. The reduction in monocyte microparticles 1 month after surgery was strongly associated with the reduction in hemoglobin A1c (P < .05). The reduction in monocyte microparticles 12 months after surgery correlated strongly with the reduction in body mass index (P < .05). CONCLUSION The reduction in microparticles after bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus reflects an attenuation of inflammation, and this mechanism might contribute to normalization of glycemic control.","Cheng, Vicky; Kashyap, Sangeeta R; Schauer, Philip R; Kirwan, John P; McCrae, Keith R",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2011.09.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22093380/,388

97558,A Review and Considerations on Palliative Care Improvements for African Americans With Cancer.,2020-06-03,"The oncoproteins of human tumor viruses regularly interact with the cellular epigenetic machinery. Such interactions alter the epigenome of the host cell and reprogram its gene expression pattern. Altered levels or redistribution of (cytosine-5)-DNA methyltransferases and changes in the cellular methylome were observed in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human papillomavirus (HPV) associated neoplasms and cell lines. Methylation-mediated silencing of cellular promoters was also noted in Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) positive Merkel cell carcinomas, and, as discussed elsewhere, in EBV-associated malignancies and adenovirus-induced rodent tumors as well. Promoter activation also occurred, either associated with DNA hypomethylation or with the induction of euchromatic histone modifications by viral oncoproteins. It is worthy to notice that HCV infection induced large, hypomethylated blocks of cellular chromatin, although the exact molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In hepatoma cells expressing HBx, the oncoprotein encoded by the HBV genome, demethylation of the repetitive satellite 2 sequences was observed, due to downregulation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B. Tax and HBZ, the oncoproteins of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), can both activate and silence distinct cellular promoters by interacting with cellular enzymes involved in histone modification.","Minarovits, Janos; Demcsák, Anett; Banati, Ferenc; Niller, Hans Helmut",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24738-0_4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26659264/,388

In this regard, we aimed to measure the potential associations of the current use of PPIs with the infection rates of COVID-19 among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. DESIGN Data were derived from a Korean nationwide cohort study with propensity score matching. We included 132 316 patients older than 18 years who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 January and 15 May 2020. Endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 positivity (primary) and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (secondary: admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation or death). RESULTS In the entire cohort, there were 111 911 non-users, 14 163 current PPI users and 6242 past PPI users. After propensity score matching, the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate was not associated with the current or past use of PPIs. Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, the current use of PPIs conferred a 79% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, while the relationship with the past use of PPIs remained insignificant. Current PPI use starting within the previous 30 days was associated with a 90% increased risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Patients taking PPIs are at increased risk for severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 but not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that physicians need to assess benefit-risk assessments in the management of acid-related diseases amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Seung Won; Ha, Eun Kyo; Yeniova, Abdullah Özgür; Moon, Sung Yong; Kim, So Young; Koh, Hyun Yong; Yang, Jee Myung; Jeong, Su Jin; Moon, Sun Joon; Cho, Joo Young; Yoo, In Kyung; Yon, Dong Keon",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732368/,388

We aim to evaluate the accuracy of the IgM-Shed Acute Phase Antigen (IgM-SAPA) test in the diagnosis of CChD at birth. METHODS Two cohort studies (training and validation cohorts) were conducted in three hospitals in the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Pregnant women were screened for Chagas disease, and all infants born to seropositive mothers were followed for up to nine months to diagnose CChD. A composite reference standard was used to determine congenital infection and was based on the parallel use of microscopy, qPCR, and IgM-TESA-blot (Trypomastigote Excreted-Secreted Antigens) at birth and/or 1-month, and/or the detection of anti-Trypanosomacruzi IgG at 6- or 9- months. The diagnostic accuracy of the IgM-SAPA-test was calculated at birth against the composite reference standard. RESULTS Adherence to the 6- or 9-month follow-up ranged from 43.8% to 59.7%. Most cases of CChD (training and validation cohort: 76.5% and 83.7%, respectively) were detected during the first month of life using the combination of microscopy, qPCR and/or IgM-TESA-blot. Results from the validation cohort showed that when only one infant sample obtained at birth was evaluated, the qPCR and the IgM-SAPA-test have similar accuracy (sensitivity: range 79.1% to 97.1%, and 76.7% to 94.3%, respectively, and specificity: 99.5%, and 92.6%, respectively).

One of the most difficult challenges that nurses faced in the midst of the crisis was the lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). The lack of PPE left health care professionals with a complicated ethical dilemma: Is there an ethical duty to care for patients in the absence of proper PPE? This article seeks to help the individual nurse (a) understand the ethical dilemma and the tensions that it brings, (b) look to the literature for guidance, and (c) understand how individuals can apply these ethical principles. After careful analysis, the recommendation is for the individual nurse to make a thorough assessment of their personal situation. This will include consideration for their family, community, financial responsibilities, legal protections, organizational policies, and personal health risk. Finally, this article serves as a call to organizations and professional leaders to increase their support of frontline health care workers and provide the individual nurse with the information they need in order to make sound decisions.","Rasmussen, Amy; Dambrino, Kathryn",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560049/,388

102564,Outbreak of anorexia nervosa admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-07-24,"OBJECTIVES Management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) requires repeated endoscopic mucosal sampling to assess disease activity. A less invasive and expensive means of monitoring of EoE is required. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy, safety, and tolerability of the cytosponge compared to endoscopy and biopsy for histologic assessment of EoE. METHODS In this prospective two-center cross-sectional study, patients with known EoE underwent cytosponge sampling followed by endoscopy and biopsy. Sample adequacy and eosinophil counts (eos/HPF) were determined for both cytosponge and endoscopic samples. The cytosponge was assessed for diagnostic accuracy, safety, and patient preference as compared to endoscopy. RESULTS Six patients (7%) failed to swallow the sponge. One hundred and five procedures were successfully performed in 80 patients (66% male, 100% white, 19% stricture). The cytosponge sample was adequate in 102 and the biopsy in 104; 101 procedures had adequate samples by both techniques. Fifty-seven biopsies were graded as active EoE with ≥15 eos/HPF as the gold standard. Eosinophil counts highly correlated between the biopsy and cytosponge (r=0.78, P<0.0001). Using a cutoff of ≤15 eos/HPF for inactive disease, the sensitivity and specificity of the cytosponge was 75% and 86%, respectively. Six patients had active EoE on cytosponge not found on biopsy. For biopsies with inactive EoE, the cytosponge identified 38/44. No complications occurred, and cytosponge endoscopic abrasion scores were low (0.34/4). Patients preferred cytosponge to endoscopy with higher rating scores (7.27 vs. 6.11, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Compared to endoscopy with biopsy, cytosponge provided a minimally invasive, safe, well tolerated, and accurate method to assess EoE histologic activity.

105777,The Current Health Care Crisis-Inspirational Leadership (or Lack Thereof) Is Contagious.,2020-06-01,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases without effective therapies. Immunotherapies using antibodies to lower assembled Aβ provide a promising approach and have been widely studied. Anti-amyloid antibodies are often selective to amyloid conformation, and the lack of amyloid-antibody structural information limits our understanding of these antibodies' conformation selection. Gantenerumab and crenezumab are two anti-Aβ antibodies that bind multi-forms of Aβ, with different Aβ epitope preferences. Here, using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we study the binding of two antibodies to Aβ1-40 fibril, whose conformation is derived from AD patient's brain tissue. We find that gantenerumab recognizes Aβ1-11 monomer fragment only in slightly lower pH than physiological environment where His6 of Aβ1-11 is protonated. Both gantenerumab and crenezumab bind with integrated Aβ fibril rather than bind to monomers within the fibril. Gantenerumab preferentially binds to the N-terminal region of the Aβ1-40 fibril, which is driven by aromatic interactions. Crenezumab can recognize the N-terminal region, as well as the cross-section of the Aβ1-40 fibril, indicating its multiple binding modes in Aβ fibril recognition. These results demonstrate that conformation-dependent interactions of antibody-amyloid recognition.","Chen, Yujie; Wei, Guanghong; Zhao, Jun; Nussinov, Ruth; Ma, Buyong",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991803/,388

108008,Use of implementation science in tobacco control intervention studies in the USA between 2000 and 2020: a scoping review protocol.,2020-11-11,"OBJECTIVE The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) is an innovative new technique for securing cerebral aneurysms. It is designed particularly for wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms that otherwise would be difficult to treat. There is a paucity of follow-up data in the literature due to the novelty of this technique. The authors reviewed their data from cases involving patients treated at Leeds General Infirmary with the WEB device. They assessed the safety and complication risk associated with the device and clinical and radiological follow-up outcomes in their patients. This is, to their knowledge, the first publication to include the new single-layer sphere device (WEB SLS) in addition to the original dual-layer (WEB DL) and the (nonsphere) single-layer (WEB SL) devices. METHODS Data from 22 patients who underwent 25 WEB treatments were analyzed. Of the 25 WEB procedures, 3 were performed on an acute basis, 1 was performed on a semiacute basis, and the remaining 21 were elective. A novel 6-point scoring system called the Leeds WEB aneurysm occlusion scale was created to ensure accurate assessment based on the morphology of the WEB device. Outcome was assessed at follow-up by MR angiography with or without digital subtraction angiography and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 22 (88%) of 25 procedures; 3 (12%) of the attempts at WEB treatment were abandoned. One of the patients in whom treatment was abandoned underwent a successful second attempt. Immediately after the 22 procedures with successful deployment, 4 (18%) of the patients had a complete occlusion of the aneurysm and WEB device; 10 (45%) had varying degrees of occlusion within the WEB device but no aneurysm neck or remnant; 3 (14%) had a neck remnant; and 5 (23%) had an aneurysm remnant. Of the patients with an aneurysm remnant, 1 had a complete aneurysm occlusion at ≥ 3-months follow-up. In total, 6 (27%) patients had a residual aneurysm at ≥ 3-months radiological follow-up. One of these patients was admitted with hydrocephalus secondary to a recurrent aneurysm and later received a second WEB treatment with additional coiling. Only 1 patient developed new neurological symptoms. This patient went from an mRS score of 0 to a score of 1 and had radiological evidence of a thromboembolic event. Two patients showed radiological evidence of a new thromboembolic event on follow-up MRI but were clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS The WEB has shown itself to be a promising new device with the potential to increase the scope of treatment for difficult wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The technique is safe, and short-term results show effective occlusion of complex aneurysms with minimal complications associated with the procedure. Long-term efficacy, however, still needs to be assessed.","Lawson, Aimee; Goddard, Tony; Ross, Stuart; Tyagi, Atul; Deniz, Kenan; Patankar, Tufail",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.4.jns142456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27081907/,388

METHODS A realist evaluation to develop and test a programme theory of how QICs work to improve healthcare in care homes. A multiple case study design considered implementation across 4 sites and 29 care homes. Observations, interviews and focus groups captured contexts and mechanisms operating within QICs. Data analysis classified emerging themes using context-mechanism-outcome configurations to explain how NHS and care home staff work together to design and implement improvement. RESULTS QICs will be able to implement and iterate improvements in care homes where they have a broad and easily understandable remit; recruit staff with established partnership working between the NHS and care homes; use strategies to build relationships and minimise hierarchy; protect and pay for staff time; enable staff to implement improvements aligned with existing work; help members develop plans in manageable chunks through QI coaching; encourage QIC members to recruit multidisciplinary support through existing networks; facilitate meetings in care homes and use shared learning events to build multidisciplinary interventions stepwise. Teams did not use measurement for change, citing difficulties integrating this into pre-existing and QI-related workload.

The aerodynamic particle size distribution of ciclesonide discharged from Alvesco MDI was evaluated using a Next Generation Impactor in the presence and absence of VHCs. The use of VHCs retained or slightly increased the amount of ciclesonide in the fine particle diameter range (aerodynamic particle size below 3 μm) (FPD) and reduced the amount at the induction port after coordinated inhalation. However, the use of VHC reduced the FPD of the formulation by increasing the time between the MDI discharge and the pump suction by various degrees among the five VHCs.

For example, respondents may be more likely to use the extremes of the response scale independent of their true score. Research already shows that differing response styles can create a construct-irrelevant source of bias that distorts fundamental inferences made based on survey data. While some initial studies examine the effect of response styles on survey scores in longitudinal analyses, the issue of how response styles affect estimates of growth is underexamined. In this study, we conducted empirical and simulation analyses in which we scored surveys using item response theory (IRT) models that do and do not account for response styles, and then used those different scores in growth models and compared results. Generally, we found that response styles can affect estimates of growth parameters including the slope, but that the effects vary by psychological construct, response style, and IRT model used.","Soland, James; Kuhfeld, Megan",Multivariate behavioral research,https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2020.1778440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633574/,388

113922,Sleep tracking: A systematic review of the research using commercially available technology.,2019,"BACKGROUND Peak flow testing is a common procedure performed in ambulatory care. There are currently no data regarding aerosol generation during this procedure. Given the ongoing debate regarding the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol generation during peak flow testing. METHODS Five healthy volunteers performed peak flow maneuvers in a particle-free laboratory space. Two devices continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure. One device can detect ultrafine particles 0.02-1 μm in diameter, while the second device can detect particles 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 μm in diameter. Five different peak flow meters were compared to ambient baseline during masked and unmasked tidal breathing. RESULTS Ultrafine particles (0.02-1 μm) were generated during peak flow measurement. There was no significant difference in ultrafine particle mean concentration between peak flow meters (P = .23): Respironics (1.25 ± 0.47 particles/mL), Philips (3.06 ± 1.22), Clement Clarke (3.55 ± 1.22 particles/mL), Respironics Low Range (3.50 ± 1.52 particles/mL), and Monaghan (3.78 ± 1.31 particles/mL). Ultrafine particle mean concentration with peak flow testing was significantly higher than masked (0.22 ± 0.29 particles/mL) and unmasked tidal breathing (0.15 ± 0.18 particles/mL, P = .01), but the ultrafine particle concentrations were small compared to ambient particle concentrations in a pulmonary function testing room (89.9 ± 8.95 particles/mL). CONCLUSIONS In this study, aerosol generation was present during peak flow testing, but concentrations were small compared to the background particle concentration in the ambient clinical environment. Surgical masks and eye protection are likely sufficient infection control measures during peak expiratory flow testing in asymptomatic patients with well controlled respiratory symptoms, but COVID-19 testing remains prudent in patients with acute respiratory symptoms prior to evaluation and peak expiratory flow assessment while the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases remains high.","Subat, Yosuf W; Guntupalli, Siva Kamal; Sajgalik, Pavol; Hainy, Matthew E; Torgerud, Keith D; Helgeson, Scott A; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G; Lim, Kaiser G; Niven, Alexander S",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035146/,388

Nine male and three female participants took part in a 36-hour sustained endurance event without sleep (N = 12, mean age = 31.8 ± 5.0 yrs). Participants were stopped for data collection at checkpoints throughout the 36-hour event. Tympanic temperature was assessed, a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) was administered, and saliva samples were collected. Salivary melatonin was determined via immunoassay. During the 36 hours of competition, melatonin levels were negatively correlated with the day of the race (rs = -0.277, P = 0.039) and positively associated with nighttime (rs = 0.316, P = 0.021). Significant main effects of tympanic temperature (P < 0.001), day of the competition (P = 0.018), and a tympanic temperature ∗ day of competition interaction (P < 0.001) were used to predict minor lapses in attention. No associations between melatonin levels and cognitive function were observed (P > 0.05). During the event tympanic temperature declined and was associated with an increase in lapses in attention. With sustained endurance events becoming more popular future research is warranted to evaluate the physiological impact of participation.","Davis, Greggory R; Etheredge, Corey E; Marcus, Lena; Bellar, David",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/781863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25110695/,388

RAPN is increasingly utilised in the management of small renal masses. To this end it is imperative that WIT is kept to a minimum to maintain renal function. METHODS RAPN was performed via a four-arm robotic transperitoneal approach. The renal artery and vein were individually clamped with robotic vascular bulldog clamps to allow cold scissor excision of the tumour. The cut surface was then sutured with one or two running 3-0 V-Loc (TM) sutures, following which the vascular clamps were released. Specific bleeding vessels were then selectively oversewn and the collecting system repaired. Renorrhaphy was then completed using a running horizontal mattress 0-0 V-Loc (TM) suture. RESULTS A total of 16 patients underwent RAPN with a median WIT of 15 minutes (range: 8-25), operative time 230 minutes (range: 180-280) and blood loss of 100 mL (range: 50-1000). There were no transfusions, secondary haemorrhages or urine leaks. There was one focal positive margin in a central 5.5 cm pT3a renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Long-term estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not significantly different to pre-operative values. CONCLUSION In this patient series, early vascular release effectively minimised WIT and maintained renal function without compromising perioperative safety.","Lah, Kevin; Desai, Devang; Chabert, Charles; Gericke, Christian; Gianduzzo, Troy",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6276.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26069733/,388

Recently, random waveform electric vestibular stimulation has become an increasingly common means of probing the vestibular system. However, many of the methods used to analyze the behavioral response to this type of stimulation assume a linear relationship between frequencies in the stimulus and its associated response. Here we examine this stimulus-response frequency linearity to determine the validity of this assumption. Forty-five university-aged subjects stood on a force-plate for 4 min while receiving vestibular stimulation. To determine the linearity of the stimulus-response relationship we calculated the cross-frequency power coupling between a 0 and 25 Hz bandwidth limited white noise stimulus and induced postural responses, as measured using the horizontal forces acting at the feet. Ultimately, we found that, on average, the postural response to a random stimulus is linear across stimulation frequencies. This result supports the use of analysis methods that depend on the assumption of stimulus-response frequency linearity, such as coherence and gain, which are commonly used to analyze the body's response to random waveform electric stimuli.","Hannan, Kelci B; Todd, Makina K; Pearson, Nicole J; Forbes, Patrick A; Dakin, Christopher J",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.631782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867958/,388

118697,Urgent Creation of a Palliative Care Team in a Small Hospital During the COVID Crisis.,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND Polyurethane-coated conical implants were introduced by Silimed (US distributor: Sientra, Santa Barbara, California) in 2008 and offer an alternative to round or anatomically shaped implants. By their design and volume distribution, they naturally create central volume and give a reasonable fullness to the upper pole while lifting some ptotic breasts, thus avoiding the need for classical mastopexy. OBJECTIVES The authors discuss the advantages of conical implants as an alternative to conventional silicone implants for women with breast ptosis. METHODS In the 2-year period between December 2010 and December 2012, a consecutive series of 302 women underwent implant-based breast surgery procedures (236 primary augmentations, 59 revisions, and 7 mastopexy-augmentations) with conical polyurethane devices. Implant volumes ranged from 225 to 560 cc, with low- to medium-profile devices predominating. No extra-high-profile implants were used. Only 1 patient had a drain inserted on completion of a revision augmentation. RESULTS There were no infections (0%) and no wound dehiscence (0%). Four cases required reoperation (1.3%). Patient satisfaction scores were universally high (average, 9.94/10). There have been no capsular contractures to date, but follow-up is short. CONCLUSION The modern conical, polyurethane implant has many advantages over the conventional round or anatomically shaped implants and offers patients an ideal compromise between volume, natural upper pole fullness, and a lift without mastopexy scars.","Georgeu, Garrick A; Frame, James D; Frame, James D",Aesthetic surgery journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090820x13512855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335014/,388

Following topical anaesthesia with lidocaine and low-dose remifentanil infusion, oral intubation was performed using a split oral airway to guide the fibrescope. The patient positioned herself on the Jackson operating table, following which general anaesthesia was induced. This technique optimised protection of the patient's eyes and other pressure areas while preventing undue cardiorespiratory compromise.

Since a standard method has not been established yet, the feasibility of using V-loc 180 (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) suture material was evaluated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS During January 2012 to March 2015, 25 patients who underwent linear stapling EJ and V-loc 180 closure of remaining enterotomy were included in this study. Basic clinico-pathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and short-term complications were analyzed. RESULTS The mean patient age was 60.4 ± 8.5 years. Nineteen males and six females were included in this study. The mean body mass index was 25.3 ± 2.3 kg/m2. There were 22 stage-I, 2 stage-II, and 1 stage-III gastric cancer patients. The mean operation time was 240.5 ± 44.6 min, and the time for anastomosis was 38.8 ± 11.2 min. The procedures were successfully performed in all cases without any intra-operative complications. There was one case of EJ leakage that occurred at the corner of EJ staple line and not at the enterotomy closure site. CONCLUSIONS The closure of the remaining enterotomy site using V-loc 180 suture following linear stapler EJ is technically feasible and safe during the TLTG procedure. However, further experience and results from other surgeons are necessary to generalize this procedure.","Kim, Dong Jin; Kim, Wook; Lee, Jun Hyun",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2016.1236857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27764571/,388
119202,The messages presented in online electronic cigarette promotions and discussions: a scoping review protocol.,2017,"Dopamine receptors are abundant along the central nigrostriatal tract and are expressed as 5 subtypes in two receptor families. In PD, compensatory changes in dopamine receptors emerge as a consequence of the loss of dopamine nerve terminals or dopaminergic pharmacotherapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available PET and single-photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated dopamine receptors in PD, PSP and MSA. The inclusion criteria were studies including human PET or single-photon emission computed tomography imaging; dopamine receptor tracers (D1-like or D2-like) and idiopathic PD, PSP, or MSA patients compared with healthy controls. The 67 included D2-like studies had 1925 patients. Data were insufficient for an analysis of D1-like studies. PD patients had higher striatal binding early in the disease, but after a disease duration of 4.36 years, PD patients had lower binding values than healthy controls. Striatal D2R binding was highest in unmedicated early PD patients and in the striatum contralateral to the predominant motor symptoms. PSP and MSA-P patients had lower striatal D2R binding than PD patients (14.2% and 21.8%, respectively). There is initial upregulation of striatal D2Rs in PD, which downregulate on average 4 years after motor symptom onset, possibly because of agonist-induced effects. The consistent upregulation of D2Rs in the PD striatum contralateral to the predominant motor symptoms indicates that receptor changes are driven by neurodegeneration and loss of striatal neuropil. Both PSP and MSA patients have clearly lower striatal D2R binding values than PD patients, which offers an opportunity for differential diagnostics. © 2021 The Authors.

120034,"Reply to: Comment on Moody: ""'Advance' Care Planning Reenvisioned"".",2021-01-31,"OBJECTIVES The optimal time to initiate renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury is controversial. We investigated the effect of such earlier versus later initiation of renal replacement therapy on the primary outcome of 28-day mortality and other patient-centered secondary outcomes. DESIGN We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to July 17, 2020, and included randomized controlled trials comparing earlier versus later renal replacement therapy. SETTING Multiple centers involved in eight trials. PATIENTS Total of 4,588 trial participants. INTERVENTION Two independents investigators screened and extracted data using a predefined form. We selected randomized controlled trials in critically ill adult patients with acute kidney injury and compared of earlier versus later initiation of renal replacement therapy regardless of modality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Overall, 28-day mortality was similar between earlier and later renal replacement therapy initiation (38.43% vs 38.06%, respectively; risk ratio, 1.01; [95% CI, 0.94-1.09]; I = 0%). Earlier renal replacement therapy, however, shortened hospital length of stay (mean difference, -2.14 d; [95% CI, -4.13 to -0.14]) and ICU length of stay (mean difference, -1.18 d; [95% CI, -1.95 to -0.42]). In contrast, later renal replacement therapy decreased the use of renal replacement therapy (relative risk, 0.69; [95% CI, 0.58-0.82]) and lowered the risk of catheter-related blood stream infection (risk ratio, 0.50, [95% CI, 0.29-0.86). Among survivors, renal replacement therapy dependence at day 28 was similar between earlier and later renal replacement therapy initiation (risk ratio, 0.98; [95% CI, 0.66-1.40]). CONCLUSIONS Earlier or later initiation of renal replacement therapy did not affect mortality. However, earlier renal replacement therapy was associated with significantly shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, whereas later renal replacement therapy was associated with decreased use of renal replacement therapy and decreased risk of catheter-related blood stream infection. These findings can be used to guide the management of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.","Naorungroj, Thummaporn; Neto, Ary Serpa; Yanase, Fumitaka; Eastwood, Glenn; Wald, Ron; Bagshaw, Sean M; Bellomo, Rinaldo",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861550/,388

As such, provision of nutrition is part of the medical care of these patients. This review provides detail and interpretation of current data on specialized nutrition therapy in critically ill patients, with focus on recently published studies. DATA SOURCES The authors used literature searches, personal contact with critical care nutrition experts, and knowledge of unpublished data for this review. STUDY SELECTION Published and unpublished nutrition studies, consisting of observational and randomized controlled trials, are reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION The authors used consensus to summarize the evidence behind specialized nutrition. DATA SYNTHESIS In addition, the authors provide recommendations for nutritional care of the critically ill patient. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that enteral nutrition, started as soon as possible after acute resuscitative efforts, may serve therapeutic roles beyond providing calories and protein. Although many new studies have further advanced our knowledge in this area, the appropriate level of standardization has not yet been achieved for nutrition therapy, as it has in other areas of critical care. Protocolized nutrition therapy should be modified for each institution based on available expertise, local barriers, and existing culture in the ICU to optimize evidence-based nutrition care for each critically ill patient.","McClave, Stephen A; Martindale, Robert G; Rice, Todd W; Heyland, Daren K",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251763/,388

Until now, there has been no available medication for treating EVD68-related diseases. Rheum emodin, artemisinin, astragaloside, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin are natural extracts from Chinese herbs that have traditionally been used for the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Our results showed that pseudolaric acid B protected cells from EVD68-induced cytopathic effects and decreased viral production. However, the same effects were not observed with rheum emodin, astragaloside, or artemisinin. Pseudolaric acid B inhibited EVD68 production by manipulating the host cell cycle in G2/M phase. Further, either oridonin or erianin related G2/M arrest also inhibited viral production. Due to inducing G2/M phase arrest, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin might be good candidates for inhibiting EVD68 production, and Chinese herbs with natural compounds inducing G2/M arrest should be considered for the treatment of EVD68-related diseases.","Meng, Xiangling; Yu, Xiaoyan; Liu, Chunyu; Wang, Ying; Song, Fengmei; Huan, Chen; Huo, Wenbo; Zhang, Shuxia; Li, Zhaolong; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Wenyan; Yu, Jinghua",Phytotherapy research : PTR,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.6214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30346067/,388

The purpose of this commentary is to identify potential benefits of telecommuting in pharmacy practice and provide implementation recommendations for its use in pharmacy practice. SUMMARY Advances in electronic health records and telepharmacy over the past 2 decades enabled pharmacy leaders to easily adapt their practice models to allow for telecommuting alternatives during the pandemic. While these changes were generally intended to be part of the short-term response, the sustained expansion of telecommuting within the pharmacy profession merits further exploration. Documented experience with telepharmacy and telehealth indicate a wide array of clinical and operational pharmacist activities that could be conducted by telecommuters. In addition, experience with telecommuters in other industries suggests potential benefits ranging from improving pharmacists' work-life balance to mitigating postpandemic financial burden.

Given the promising results of our previous phase II study evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with S-1 plus cisplatin (JCOG0210), we performed a phase III study to confirm the efficacy of NAC in these patients, with the safety and surgical results are presented here. METHODS Eligible patients were randomized to gastrectomy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (Arm A) or NAC followed by gastrectomy + adjuvant chemotherapy (Arm B). The primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS). This trial is registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as C000000279. RESULTS From February 2007 to July 2013, 300 patients were randomized (Arm A 149, Arm B 151). NAC was completed in 133 patients (88%). Major grade 3/4 adverse events during NAC were neutropenia (29.3%), nausea (5.4%), diarrhea (4.8%), and fatigue (2.7%). Gastrectomy was performed in 147 patients (99%) in Arm A and 139 patients (92%) in Arm B. The operation time was significantly shorter in Arm B than in Arm A (median 255 vs. 240 min, respectively; p = 0.024). There were no significant differences in Grade 2-4 morbidity and mortality (25.2% and 1.3% in Arm A and 15.8% and 0.7% in Arm B, respectively).

Herein, rationale development of amorphous solid dispersion with hot-melt extrusion of poorly bioavailable OLM was carried out with the aid of quality by design (QbD), in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo evaluations. Polymer selection commenced with the selection of thermoplastic water-soluble polymers with the compatible processing temperature window as per the thermal behavior of OLM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well assisted in the selection of a carrier. Promising dissolution enhancement was observed with the help of Kollidon VA-64 (VA-64) as a carrier. Optimization of the formulation was executed using the QbD approach with design of experiment as a statistical optimization tool. Interactions between VA-64 and OLM on the atomic level were studied with the help of atomistic MD simulations. Characterization of the optimized extrudates were carried out with scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, in-vitro dissolution study, and in-vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Molecular-level mixing of OLM with VA-64 resulted into glass solution formation which rapidly dissolves (28 times in-vitro dissolution enhancement) in GI tract fluids and instantly gets absorbed into blood circulation. In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies performed in Sprague-Dawley rats reflected superior bioavailability (201.60%) with a significant increase in the Cmax with short Tmax through amorphization of OLM.

In this review, we highlight various examples of oligonucleotide-based biosensors for the detection of diseases, drugs, and environmentally hazardous chemicals. Each example is provided with detailed schematics of the detection mechanism in addition to the supporting experimental results. Furthermore, future perspectives and new challenges in oligonucleotide-based biosensors are discussed.","Jung, Il Young; Lee, Eun Hee; Suh, Ah Young; Lee, Seung Jin; Lee, Hyukjin",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-9212-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26781106/,388

Using an online survey, we explored how the psychosocial effects of the pandemic affected the mental health of LGBTQ+ young adults who were confined with their parents during the lockdown period (N = 1,934), from six countries: Portugal, UK, Italy, Brazil, Chile, and Sweden. South American participants experienced more negative psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Depression and anxiety were higher among participants who were younger, not working, living in Europe and who reported feeling more emotionally affected by the pandemic, uncomfortable at home, or isolated from non-LGBTQ friends. Not attending higher education predicted depression while not being totally confined at home, residing habitually with parents, and fearing more future infection predicted anxiety. LGBTQ+ community groups, as well as health and educational services should remain particularly attentive to the needs of LGBTQ+ young adults during health crises.","Gato, Jorge; Barrientos, Jaime; Tasker, Fiona; Miscioscia, Marina; Cerqueira-Santos, Elder; Malmquist, Anna; Seabra, Daniel; Leal, Daniela; Houghton, Marie; Poli, Mikael; Gubello, Alessio; Ramos, Mozer de Miranda; Guzmán, Mónica; Urzúa, Alfonzo; Ulloa, Francisco; Wurm, Matilda",Journal of homosexuality,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2020.1868186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480823/,388
124904,Building patient capacity to participate in care during hospitalisation: a scoping review.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Perineal hernia is a protrusion of the pelvic floor containing intra-abdominal viscera. The occurrence of postoperative perineal hernia after abdominoperineal resection (APR) is rare, but reports have indicated a recent increase in occurrence following surgical treatment for rectal cancer. This has been attributed to a shift towards extralevator abdominoperineal resection, together with more frequent and long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy. PRESENTATION OF CASE Here, we report the case of a patient who underwent APR for cancer. Twenty months postoperative, a perineal hernia was detected. The patient was electively scheduled for surgery. Robot-assisted laparoscopy was performed using the da Vinci Surgical System. The perineal hernia was repaired by primary closure with the placement of Symbotex Composite mesh as reinforcement for the pelvic floor. The surgery was performed without any adverse events, and the patient was discharged the day after surgery. Clinical follow-up proceeded at the designated time intervals without difficulties. DISCUSSION Recurrence rates of perineal hernia remain high, and surgeons face numerous challenges related to poor view, suturing and mesh placement in the deep pelvis. Numerous approaches have been described, but there is still no consensus as to the optimal repair technique for perineal hernia. CONCLUSION Symptomatic perineal hernias can feasibly be repaired with robot-assisted laparoscopy. Furthermore, suturing and mesh placement require less effort with the robot approach when compared to the open and laparoscopic approaches. These promising findings are demonstrated in the included video.","Rajabaleyan, Pooya; Dorfelt, Allan; Poornoroozy, Peiman; Vadgaard Andersen, Per",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690283/,388
125047,Advanced consent for participation in acute care randomised control trials: protocol for a scoping review.,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND Activated platelets can be found on the surface of inflamed, rupture-prone and ruptured plaques as well as in intravascular thrombosis. They are key players in thrombosis and atherosclerosis. In this study we describe the construction of a radiolabeled single-chain antibody targeting the LIBS-epitope of activated platelets to selectively depict platelet activation and wall-adherent non-occlusive thrombosis in a mouse model with nuclear imaging using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography as well as small animal SPECT-CT for in vivo analysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS LIBS as well as an unspecific control single-chain antibody were labeled with (111)Indium ((111)In) via bifunctional DTPA ( = (111)In-LIBS/(111)In-control). Autoradiography after incubation with (111)In-LIBS on activated platelets in vitro (mean 3866 ± 28 DLU/mm(2), 4010 ± 630 DLU/mm(2) and 4520 ± 293 DLU/mm(2)) produced a significantly higher ligand uptake compared to (111)In-control (2101 ± 76 DLU/mm(2), 1181 ± 96 DLU/mm(2) and 1866 ± 246 DLU/mm(2)) indicating a specific binding to activated platelets; P<0.05. Applying these findings to an ex vivo mouse model of carotid artery thrombosis revealed a significant increase in ligand uptake after injection of (111)In-LIBS in the presence of small thrombi compared to the non-injured side, as confirmed by histology (49630 ± 10650 DLU/mm(2) vs. 17390 ± 7470 DLU/mm(2); P<0.05). These findings could also be reproduced in vivo. SPECT-CT analysis of the injured carotid artery with (111)In-LIBS resulted in a significant increase of the target-to-background ratio compared to (111)In-control (1.99 ± 0.36 vs. 1.1 ± 0.24; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Nuclear imaging with (111)In-LIBS allows the detection of platelet activation in vitro and ex vivo with high sensitivity. Using SPECT-CT, wall-adherent activated platelets in carotid arteries could be depicted in vivo. These results encourage further studies elucidating the role of activated platelets in plaque pathology and atherosclerosis and might be of interest for further developments towards clinical application.","Heidt, Timo; Deininger, Friederike; Peter, Karlheinz; Goldschmidt, Jürgen; Pethe, Annette; Hagemeyer, Christoph E; Neudorfer, Irene; Zirlik, Andreas; Weber, Wolfgang A; Bode, Christoph; Meyer, Philipp T; Behe, Martin; von Zur Mühlen, Constantin",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479193/,388

Her symptoms on admission were vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, agitation and anxiety. Initial laboratory tests showed a slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and mild liver and kidney dysfunction The patient was transferred to the medium care unit of our hospital where she was observed for possible organ failure. During the next days the kidney function improved and liver function started to recover. Four days after admission, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward. Urine, serum, plasma and whole-blood samples were analyzed for ricinine using a quantitative LC-MS-MS method. Initial values on admission (serum and urine) were very high in comparison with previously reported cases. Based on these values, the patient was monitored closely in the following days. The patient made a full recovery and during the course of hospitalization, concentrations of ricinine in plasma/serum, blood and urine gradually declined. The presence of ricinine in a patient's blood or plasma is proof of castor bean, hence, ricin exposure. However, based on this case and previous reported cases in literature, we can conclude that no clear correlation can be established between ricinine blood, plasma or urine levels and the severity of the intoxication. Clinicians should be aware of the potential danger of a ricin intoxication and patients should be monitored closely for several days due to the unpredictable outcome of the intoxication.","Lefever, Stefanie; Geerts, Inge; Vermeulen, Edith; Vermeersch, Pieter; Rydt, Frederic De; Dobbels, Laurens; Gillis, Marc; Croes, Kathleen",Journal of analytical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/bkaa139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991682/,388

METHOD A collaborative panel of experts from major professional organizations developed provisional guidance for neuropsychological practice during the pandemic. The stakeholders included the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology/American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, the National Academy of Neuropsychology, Division 40 of the American Psychological Association, the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology, and the American Psychological Association Services, Inc. The group reviewed literature, collated federal, regional and state regulations and information from insurers, and surveyed practitioners to identify best practices. RESULTS Literature indicates that TeleNP may offer reliable and valid assessments, but clinicians need to consider limitations, develop new informed consent procedures, report modifications of standard procedures, and state limitations to diagnostic conclusions and recommendations. Specific limitations affect TeleNP assessments of older adults, younger children, individuals with limited access to technology, and individuals with other individual, cultural, and/or linguistic differences. TeleNP may be contraindicated or infeasible given specific patient characteristics, circumstances, and referral questions.

The study population was comprised of 552 patients. All patients were consulted and advised by telephone as regards the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospital and outpatient follow-ups were limited to the minimum. Preventive modification of immunosuppression was not recommended in relation to the pandemic. Three patients with multiple comorbidities (a woman aged 60, a man aged 59, and another man aged 83; 2.25 years, 5.5 years, and 7.5 years after heart transplantation, respectively) and one patient with concomitant arterial hypertension (a woman aged 48, 5.5 years after heart transplantation) presented with a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Three of the patients were on tacrolimus immunosuppression, and both female patients were additionally on therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, which was discontinued following the diagnosis of infection. One male patient received combined therapy of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. The 60-year-old woman presented with gastrointestinal manifestations of the COVID-19 infection which were of moderate severity. The recovery was achieved. The 59-year-old man presented with myocardial infarction, exacerbated renal insufficiency that required hemodialysis and cardiorespiratory failure complicated by bacterial sepsis. As a result, the patient died. The 83-year-old male patient reporting fever, myalgia, fatigue, cough and dyspnea was admitted to hospital and deceased due to septic shock two days after admission. The 48-year old woman who presented with mild symptoms of the upper respiratory tract infection recovered after two weeks. Symptomatic treatment was used in all the patients. Another male patient (aged 45 years, 8 years after orthotopic heart transplant with no significant comorbidities) was an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 and remained under hospital care. Conclusions Of 552 patients after orthotopic heart transplantation, two SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were reported.","Kuczaj, Agnieszka; Małyszek, Justyna; Trzcińska, Iwona; Zembala, Michał; Przybyłowski, Piotr",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.74.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860947/,388

After completion of a nasal symptom questionnaire, topical fluorescein spray was administered into the nasal and oropharynx of 10 healthy volunteers, who then underwent flexible laryngoscopy under 2 conditions: routine without provoked response and with prompted sneeze/cough. After each, droplets on the proceduralist and participant were counted under ultraviolet A light. Droplets were observed on 1 of 10 volunteers after routine laryngoscopy and 4 of 10 during laryngoscopy with sneeze/cough. A nasal symptom score based on congestion and rhinorrhea was significantly elevated among droplet producers after sneeze/cough (P = .0164). No droplets were observed on the provider. Overall, with adequate personal protective equipment, flexible laryngoscopy poses minimal droplet risk to providers.

War metaphors have been used widely to describe the scenario, but many critics decry them as harmful narratives. In this piece, we discuss the utility of the war metaphor to build solidarity and fraternity, which will be essential to get through the crisis. We also explain how concerns regarding increased authoritarianism and state excesses due to the use of these narratives are misplaced. We then tease out the colonial era concept of war that guides the arguments against the use of war metaphors in pandemics. We argue that in the post-modern world and in South Asian and African philosophies, wars are seen through the prism of the larger cause of dharma or ubuntu and that individual losses or gains in these contexts are part of a larger cause. The use of war metaphors reflects the need to get together for a societal cause.

Most patients are young females or children, all of whom express strong interest in the cosmetic results in addition to the complete resolution of their medical problems. Here, we introduce a laparoscopic management technique for a choledochal cyst. METHODS Between 2003 and 2011, we performed a laparoscopic choledochal cyst excision procedure on 82 patients using a four-hole method. There were three open-conversion cases, one case involving robotic surgery, and one case involving combined laparoscopic liver resection because the cyst had affected the liver. Excision of the cyst and anastomosis were performed laparoscopically. We will present our method with a video. RESULTS The mean operation time was 230 min. The estimated blood loss was 197 ml. The average hospital stay was 8.6 days. The most common complications were minor bile leakage (7 %) and fluid collection (2.5 %), both of which were managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic management can be a treatment of choice for the most instances of choledochal cyst considering its good cosmetic results and its feasible level of operative safety.","Jang, Jin-Young; Yoon, Yoo-Seok; Kang, Mee Joo; Kwon, Wooil; Park, Jae Woo; Chang, Ye Rim; Ahn, Young-Joon; Cho, Jai Young; Han, Ho-Seong; Kim, Sun-Whe",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2646-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23239299/,388

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the effects of deep neuromuscular blockade and moderate neuromuscular blockade on the quality of postoperative recovery in patients undergoing robotic gastrectomy. METHODS In this prospective, double-blind, single-center randomized controlled superiority trial with two parallel groups, 56 adult patients (19-80 years) scheduled for elective robotic gastrectomy were randomly assigned to a moderate neuromuscular blockade group or a deep neuromuscular blockade group in a 1:1 ratio. In the deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade groups, the infusion rate for rocuronium was adjusted to maintain a post-tetanic count of 1-2 or a train-of-four count of 1-2, respectively. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included the QoR-40 score on postoperative day 2, intraoperative hemodynamic data, intraoperative respiratory data, visual analog scale score for pain, postoperative incidences of nausea and vomiting, postoperative rescue analgesic use, and postoperative rescue antiemetic use. RESULTS The postoperative QoR-40 score was similar between the two groups on postoperative days 1 and 2. Moreover, the two groups showed no differences in intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory data or postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and rescue medication use. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the quality of recovery after robotic gastrectomy is similar for deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore, deep neuromuscular blockade during robotic gastrectomy may be unnecessary, at least in patients with normal body mass index.","Kim, Hyun J; Lee, Ki-Young; Kim, Myoung H; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Bai, Sun J",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324626/,388

Prior studies have reported on outcomes of sporadic ampullary lesions, and only small cohort studies have reported outcomes associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome. AIMS We performed a systematic review with pooled analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of EP for treating ampullary adenomas in FAP. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search of major databases from inception to May 2020. Studies that included patients with endoscopically resected ampullary lesions and FAP were eligible. The rate of technical success, en bloc resection, piecemeal resection, recurrence, and adverse events was pooled by means of a random-effects model to obtain a proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Six studies, including a total of 99 patients, were included in our final analysis. Patient age ranged from 28 to 91 years. Pooled technical success was 90.3% (CI 76.9-96.3%, I2 = 31%). Rate of en bloc resection was 60.6% (CI 47.9-72.0%, I2 = 0%). Recurrence rate was 25.4% (5.7-65.9%, I2 = 82%). The post-procedural pancreatitis rate was 14.7% of which 68% (51 of 75) utilized prophylactic pancreatic stenting. Other adverse events included bleeding (9.2%) and perforation (4%).

Evidence collected during the current pandemic shows that the transmission rate of the virus is significantly reduced following implementation of intensive physical distancing measures. Adherence to these recommendations has been poorer than adherence to other key transmission reduction behaviours such as handwashing. There are a complex range of reasons that are likely to predict why people do not or only partially adhere to physical distancing recommendations. In the current project we aim to address the following research questions: (1) What are the psychosocial determinants of physical distancing for the general public and for key socio-demographic sub-groups (e.g., young adults, older adults, etc.)?; (2) Do current Government of Ireland COVID-19 physical distancing communications address the determinants of physical distancing?; and (3) How can communications be optimised and tailored to sub-groups to ensure maximum adherence to guidelines? These will be addressed by conducting three work packages (WPs). In WP1, we will work closely with the iCARE international study, which includes a large online survey of public responses to measures established to reduce and slow the spread of COVID-19, including physical distancing. We will analyse Irish data, comparing it to data from other countries, to identify the key psychosocial determinants of physical distancing behaviour. This will be followed by a qualitative study to explore in depth the barriers and facilitators of physical distancing behaviour among the Irish public (WP2).

The purpose for the current study is to assess the prevalence rates of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and to establish psychosocial correlates, pandemic-themed concerns, and other comorbidities for those with GAD at the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This online study included 2,101 U.S. adults between April 14-22, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home protocols and assessed GAD, psychosocial factors, and pandemic-related factors including concerns, changes in health behaviors, and adherence to protocols. The results demonstrated a high prevalence rate (17.9%) for GAD during the initial COVID-19 outbreak compared with the prior 1.8% 12-month estimate before the pandemic. Individuals with GAD reported significantly higher levels of stress, loneliness, fatigue, and empathic concern, along with reductions in levels of quality of life. Likewise, those with GAD reported significantly higher pandemic-related concerns, poorer changes in general health behaviors, and less confidence in the government's response to the pandemic. For clinical purposes, these findings provide insight into the various types of pandemic-themed worries that individuals meeting clinical criteria for GAD will have the most difficulties controlling.","Cordaro, Millie; Grigsby, Timothy J; Howard, Jeffrey T; Deason, Rebecca G; Haskard-Zolnierek, Kelly; Howard, Krista",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1867675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480832/,388

Several tools have been developed and launched at national and international level to face the emergency, including tools to perform online triage, symptoms checking, video visits and remote monitoring, and to conduct local and national epidemiological surveillance studies. Artificial intelligence-based tools have also been developed to diagnose cases of CoViD-19 or to identify patients at risk. Most of these technologies have been endorsed by medical societies such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians which launched specific guidelines about their use. The growth in telemedicine services and in digital health technologies could not have occurred without important telehealth regulatory changes that have occurred in some countries aimed at promoting their use to face the CoViD-19 emergency, such as the deregulation of the use of video conferencing and video chat systems to carry out video visits, and the payment parity between telehealth and in clinic care. In order to decide whether to continue using these tools even after the pandemic is over, it could be useful to perform validation and efficacy studies of these tools to study their implications on the doctor-patient relationship, to understand if the new features can be integrated with the other technological tools already in use, and if they can improve clinical practice and quality of care.","Santoro, Eugenio",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3407.33919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658876/,388
134452,"Identifying the facilitators, constraints and barriers of community indoor walking programmes: protocol for a realist synthesis.",2020-07-30,"The aim of this paper was to investigate the therapeutic effect of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid recommended by Provincial Novel Coronary Virus Pneumonia Treatment Scheme on the treatment of BALB/c mice with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome and to explore its clinical application in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to provide laboratory data support for clinical Chinese medicine. According to the classification of syndromes of novel coronavirus pneumonia by the national competent department of traditional Chinese medicine, this study determined that human coronavirus 229 E(HCoV-229 E)-infected mouse model of cold and dampness syndrome can be used to study human coronavirus pneumonia combined with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome model. This model is suitable for simulating traditional Chinese medicine treatment of common disease syndromes in Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program(trial implementation of the sixth edition). Specific steps are as follows. BALB/c mice of cold and dampness syndrome is infected with HCoV-229 E virus, and were divided into normal control group, infection control group, cold-dampness control group, cold-dampness infection group(the model group), and Compound Qilan Oral Liquid high dose group(22 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)) and low dose group(11 mL·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). On the day of infection, the Compound Qilan Oral Liquid was administered for three consecutive days. On the last dosing day, the lung tissue was dissected, and the lung index and inhibition rate were calculated. The nucleic acid of lung tissue was extracted and the HCoV-229 E virus load was detected by RT-PCR. Blood leukocytes were separated and the percentage of T and B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Lung tissue protein was extracted and the contents of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ were detected by ELISA. Serum was separated and the contents of gastrin(GAS) and motilin(MTL) were detected by ELISA. Histopathological analysis was performed with lung tissue. The high and low doses of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid significantly reduced the lung index(P<0.01) of mice with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome, and the inhibition rates were 59.01% and 47.72%, respectively. Compared with the model control group, the high and low doses of Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid significantly reduced lung tissue viral load(P<0.01), increased cross blood CD4~+ T lymphocytes, CD8~+ T lymphocytes and total B lymphocyte percentage(P<0.01), reduced serum motilin content(P<0.01), reduced IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels in lungs(P<0.01) and reduced lung tissue inflammation. Compound Qinlan Oral Liquid has a better effect on the mouse model with combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking lung syndrome, which may attribute to its function of in virus replication inhibition, gastrointestinal function improvement, immunity enhancement, and inflammatory factor reduction.","Bao, Yan-Yan; Shi, Yu-Jing; Guo, Shan-Shan; Geng, Zi-Han; Bao, Lei; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Rong-Hua; Gao, Ying-Jie; Fang, Tong-Hua; Meng, Jie; Cui, Xiao-Lan",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200303.402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489023/,388

Methods Four databases were searched; PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library in August 2020 for post 2010 literature on OHCA in adults. Critical outcomes were chest compression depth, rate and fraction. Important outcomes were any return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital and survival to discharge. Results A total of 9464 studies were identified with 61 eligibility for full text screening. A total of eight studies was included in the meta-analysis. Five studies investigated real-time feedback and three investigated post-event feedback. Meta-analysis revealed that real-time feedback statistically improves compression depth and rate while post-event feedback improved depth and fraction. Feedback did not statistically improve patient outcome but an improvement in absolute numbers revealed a clinical effect of feedback. Heterogenity varied from ""might not be important"" to ""considerable"". Conclusion To significantly improve CPR quality real-time and post-event feedback should be combined. Neither real-time nor post event feedback could statistically be associated with patient outcome however, a clinical effect was detected. The conclusions reached were based on few studies of low to very low quality.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign gynecologic diseases at Dae-Jeon St. Mary's Hospital, between May 2009 and May 2016. Surgical outcomes and complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 334 women were included: 212 cases of vaginal cuff suture performed with traditional suture material and 122 cases of vaginal cuff suture performed with the barbed suture. No difference in major complications including vaginal bleeding and vaginal cuff dehiscence was found between the two groups, with a significant reduction in operative times for the barbed suture group (P = 0.002). Underlying clinical variables including diabetes, pelvic adhesion, and obesity showed no significant differences in complication rate. CONCLUSION Vaginal cuff suture performed with barbed suture material is a safe and well-tolerated procedure and reduces operative times. We did not find any meaningful decrease in postoperative vaginal complications including vaginal cuff dehiscence based on the suture material.","Kim, Su Mi; Baek, Jong Min; Song, Jae Yen; Lee, Sung Jong; Park, Eun Kyung; Kim, Chan Joo; Lee, Yong Seok",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-017-4637-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289989/,388

Accordingly, there is an unmet need for transparent biomaterials that have high adhesion, cohesion, and regenerative properties. Herein, we engineer a highly biocompatible and transparent bioadhesive for corneal reconstruction using a visible light cross-linkable, naturally derived polymer, GelCORE (gel for corneal regeneration). The physical properties of GelCORE could be finely tuned by changing prepolymer concentration and photocrosslinking time. GelCORE revealed higher tissue adhesion compared to commercial adhesives. Furthermore, in situ photopolymerization of GelCORE facilitated easy delivery to the cornea, allowing for bioadhesive curing precisely according to the required geometry of the defect. In vivo experiments, using a rabbit stromal defect model, showed that bioadhesive could effectively seal corneal defects and induce stromal regeneration and re-epithelialization. Overall, GelCORE has many advantages including low cost and ease of production and use. This makes GelCORE a promising bioadhesive for corneal repair.","Shirzaei Sani, Ehsan; Kheirkhah, Ahmad; Rana, Devyesh; Sun, Zhongmou; Foulsham, William; Sheikhi, Amir; Khademhosseini, Ali; Dana, Reza; Annabi, Nasim",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aav1281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906864/,388

The objective of the study was to determine social determinants of health among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the two major cities of Spain. METHODS A multicenter retrospective case series study was performed collecting administrative databases of all COVID-19 patients ≥18 years belonging to two centers in Madrid and two in Barcelona (Spain) collecting data from 1st March to 15th April 2020. Variables obtained age, gender, birthplace and residence ZIP code. From ZIP code we obtained per capita income of the area. Predictors of the outcomes were explored through generalized linear mixed-effects models, using center as random effect. RESULTS There were 5,235 patients included in the analysis. After multivariable analysis adjusted by age, sex, per capita income, population density, hospital experience, center and hospital saturation, patients born in Latin American countries were found to have an increase in ICU admission rates (OR 1.56 [1.13-2.15], p<0.01) but no differences were found in the same model regarding mortality (OR 1.35 [0.95-1.92], p=0.09).

Thus, healthcare waste management (HCWM) became even a greater challenge in hospitals due to Coronavirus easily spread. In this context, it was necessary to create tools that could aid healthcare facilities in evaluating their HCWM. Therefore, the objective of this article was to elaborate a support tool that helps in identifying the shortcomings of hospitals' HCWM. For this purpose, the Health Service Waste Management Index was developed based on the selection of indicators in the area. The index was applied to six hospitals in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Its application meet the purpose of this research, since the results in the form of an index objectively summarize the reality of the HCWM in healthcare facilities. From the six hospitals investigated, four were classified as highly efficient. However, even though most of them were well evaluated, they still have difficulties with properly training their employees, which can be even a worse problem during a pandemic, when every precaution is extremely important to reduce the spread of the disease. Therefore, beyond this article contribution related to sustainability by demanding the hospitals to check which points of HCWM should be improved, it also adds academically by developing a tool with indicators that evaluate operational, human, economic and environmental factors in an innovative way.","de Aguiar Hugo, Andreza; Lima, Renato da Silva","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x211010362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843362/,388

Immediate reconstruction was not possible due to prolonged operation time and resulting severe bowel edema. A silicone sheet with NPWT was applied over the exposed viscera. After 1 week, silicone sheet was substituted with a composite mesh. Then, abdominal wall reconstruction with bilateral free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps (30 × 12 cm and 25 × 12 cm sized) was performed. Since there was only a single reliable recipient vessel available, we linked 2 ALT free flaps sequentially in a flow-through fashion to the left inferior epigastric artery and vein. Two donor sites were closed primarily. The flap fully survived and the defect was covered successfully without any complication for 11 months of follow up. Multiple flaps may be needed for large full-thickness abdominal wall defect coverage. Linked fasciocutaneous free flaps could be a solution with a less donor site morbidity even in the case of limited available recipient vessels.

However, no single transection tool is uniformly considered to be better than the others. This study aimed to develop an effective, fast, and cost-efficient technique for hepatic parenchymal transection. MATERIALS AND METHODS A liver parenchyma compression device in the form of a locking straight rigid tie (LoStRiT) was newly developed. Twelve pigs were distributed into two groups. The control group ( n = 6) comprised animals that underwent hepatectomy using the standard Kelly-clysis technique. The study group (n = 6) comprised animals that underwent hepatectomy using sequential LoStRiT mechanisms. The transection speed, blood loss, and biloma formation were recorded. RESULTS The mean parenchymal transection speed was 1.27 ± 0.27 cm(2)/min for the control group and 2.39 ± 0.56 cm(2)/min for the LoStRiT group ( p = .003). The mean blood loss per kilogram of body weight was 9.8 ± 5.2 ml/kg for the control group and 3.9 ± 0.9 ml/kg for the LoStRiT group ( p = .040). No bilomas were identified. CONCLUSION LoStRiT hepatectomy appears to be effective, fast, and reproducible in a porcine model of liver resection. Further development of this novel and potentially cost-efficient technique includes construction of the device using absorbable materials.","Vrochides, Dionisios; Kardassis, Dimitrios; Ntinas, Achilleas; Miliaras, Dimosthenis; Papalois, Apostolos; Magnissalis, Evangelos; Metrakos, Peter",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2013.832825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24063662/,388

Despite a plethora of evidence on the effectiveness of supervision, scant evidence for the impact of supervision training exists. While three previous literature reviews have begun to examine the effectiveness of supervision training, they fail to explore the extent to which supervision training works, for whom, and why. We adopted a realist approach to answer the question: to what extent do supervision training interventions work (or not), for whom and in what circumstances, and why? We conducted a team-based realist synthesis of the supervision training literature focusing on Pawson's five stages: (1) clarifying the scope; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction; and (5) data synthesis. We extracted contexts (C), mechanisms (M) and outcomes (O) and CMO configurations from 29 outputs including short (n = 19) and extended-duration (n = 10) supervision training interventions. Irrespective of duration, interventions including mixed pedagogies involving active and/or experiential learning, social learning and protected time served as mechanisms triggering multiple positive supervisor outcomes. Short-duration interventions also led to positive outcomes through mechanisms such as supervisor characteristics, whereas facilitator characteristics was a key mechanism triggering positive and negative outcomes for extended-duration interventions. Disciplinary and organisational contexts were not especially influential. While our realist synthesis builds on previous non-realist literature reviews, our findings extend previous work considerably. Our realist synthesis presents a broader array of outcomes and mechanisms than have been previously identified, and provides novel insights into the causal pathways in which short and extended-duration supervision training interventions produce their effects. Future realist evaluation should explore further any differences between short and extended-duration interventions. Educators are encouraged to prioritize mixed pedagogies, social learning and protected time to maximize the positive supervisor outcomes from training.","Rees, Charlotte E; Lee, Sarah L; Huang, Eve; Denniston, Charlotte; Edouard, Vicki; Pope, Kirsty; Sutton, Keith; Waller, Susan; Ward, Bernadette; Palermo, Claire",Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-019-09937-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691182/,388

We independently extracted data and used A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) to appraise methodological quality. RESULTS Eighty-three systematic reviews met strict eligibility criteria. Most were from Europe and Latin America and reported on rehabilitative interventions. AMSTAR-2 appraisal found critically low confidence in 88% (n=73) because of multiple and varied deficiencies. Only 7% (n=6) had no AMSTAR-2 critical domain deficiency. The number of systematic reviews increased fivefold from 2015 to 2019; however, quality did not improve over time.

Peritransplant thrombocytopenia may cause serious hemorrhages. We assessed the incidence of early posttransplantation thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of <150,000 mm3 or <150 G/L) in de novo kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) across 4 immunosuppressive regimens. METHODS This was a single-center observational study that included all consecutive KTRs who received either Thymoglobulin (THY) or Grafalon (GRA) and maintenance therapy of either mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) or everolimus (EVR), associated with tacrolimus/corticosteroids. RESULTS Between July 27, 2016, and September 7, 2018, 237 KTRs were included; 64.6% experienced thrombocytopenia within the first week. Thrombocytopenia was significantly more frequent (P = .004) among GRA-treated patients (73.4%) compared to THY-treated patients (61.3%). These patients also had lower nadir platelet count (120 ± 52 vs 142 ± 48 G/L; P = .002) and lower platelet count at discharge (227 ± 94 vs 243 ± 92 G/L; P = .25). More of the GRA-EVR group had thrombocytopenia (81.0% vs 61.4% in THY-MMF, 60.9% in THY-EVR, and 69.8% in GRA-MMF; P = .081) and a worse nadir platelet count (109 ± 41 in GRA-EVR vs 141 ± 47G/L in THY-MMF, 145 ± 52 G/L in THY-EVR, and 125 ± 56 G/L in GRA-MMF; P = .011) but GRA was the only risk factor for thrombocytopenia in multivariate analyses (P = .002). Rates of hemorrhage, red blood cell transfusions, reoperations needed within the first week, delayed graft function, acute rejection, graft loss, and death did not differ between the groups after a mean follow-up of 25 ± 8 months.

METHODS This was a prospective, non-randomized, interventional clinical trial that involved five patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The intervention consisted of inducing and maintaining selective brain cooling for 24 h by positioning a catheter in the nasopharynx and circulating cold water inside the catheter in a closed-loop arrangement. Core temperature was maintained at ≥ 35 °C using counter-warming. RESULTS In all study participants, a brain temperature reduction of ≥ 2 °C was achieved. The mean brain temperature reduction from baseline was 2.5 ± 0.9 °C (P = .04, 95% confidence interval). The mean systemic temperature was 37.3 ± 1.1 °C at baseline and 36.0 ± 0.8 °C during the intervention. The mean difference between the brain temperature and the systemic temperature during intervention was - 1.2 ± 0.8 °C (P = .04). The intervention was well tolerated with no significant changes observed in the hemodynamic parameters. No relevant variations in intracranial pressure and transcranial Doppler were observed. The laboratory results underwent no major changes, aside from the K+ levels and blood counts. The K+ levels significantly varied (P = .04); however, the variation was within the normal range. Only one patient experienced an event of mild localized and superficial nasal discoloration, which was re-evaluated on the seventh day and indicated complete recovery.

150214,Palliative Care: Too Good to Be True?,2020-03-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to examine the impacts of system-wide crises on key supply sectors such as water, energy and food. These sectors are becoming increasingly interlinked in environmental policy-making and with regard to achieving supply security. There is a pressing need for a systematization of impacts and responses beyond individual disruptions. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the implications of COVID-19 on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. First, it integrates the academic literature related to single cases and disruptions to provide a broader view of COVID-19 demand- and supply-side disruptions and immediate effects. Then, the major, long-term impact categories of medicalization/hygienization, (re)localization of production, and demand fluctuations are highlighted. These impacts result in priority cross-links such as irrigation, energy requirements for local food production, energy use for water and wastewater treatment, or water for energy use. Finally, sector-level insights on impacts and responses are provided, drawing from illustrative cases. The analysis of impacts of COVID-19 on the WEF nexus reflects heterogeneous experiences of short-term adaptations, and highlights the revaluation of the water-food-trade nexus. Revived debates on food sufficiency can benefit from green applications to minimize expected trade-offs. The current crisis also reveals some gaps in the WEF nexus debates with regard to the lack of risk-based perspectives and the need for a better consideration of spatial aspects in resource integration. Regarding resource-security issues in the WEF nexus, the COVID-19 stress test boosts debates concerning the adequacy of the production value chains (e.g., contingency and storage, diversification, and self-sufficiency) and the value of cross-border integration (e.g., trade, globalization, and aid).","Al-Saidi, Mohammad; Hussein, Hussam",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030272/,388

MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective cohort study was performed to compare V-Loc (n = 40) with polyglactin (n = 40) sutures. Division of the dorsal venous complex and formation of the UVA during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using V-Loc or polyglactin sutures were studied. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters were measured. RESULTS V-Loc sutures were associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean dorsal vein suture time (3.15 minutes V-Loc vs 3.75 minutes IS, P = .02) and UVA anastomosis time (8.5 minutes V-Loc vs 11.5 minutes IS, P = .001). No significant difference was noted between operative time (121 minutes V-Loc vs 130 minutes IS, P = .199), delayed healing rates (5% V-Loc vs 7.5% IS, P = .238), continence rate at 12 months (97.5% V-Loc vs 95% IS, P = .368), and urethral stenosis rates (2.5% V-Loc vs 2.5% IS, P = .347) in both groups. CONCLUSION The use of a V-Loc running suture with a single needle driver is a feasible, reproducible, and economic technique with no significant difference in continence rates and urethral stenosis rates, compared with the use of a traditional interrupted suture.","Massoud, Walid; Thanigasalam, Ruban; El Hajj, Albert; Girard, Frederic; Théveniaud, Pierre Etienne; Chatellier, Gilles; Baumert, Hervé",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2013.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806395/,388

Therefore, we studied rates of immunity against vaccine-preventable viruses in lung transplantation (LTx) candidates and their associations with underlying lung disease and clinical characteristics. We retrospectively studied 1025 consecutive adult patients who underwent first-time evaluation for LTx at a single center between January 2016 and October 2018. Viruses studied included varicella zoster (VZV), measles, and mumps. Young age (17-48 yo) was negatively associated with immunity for VZV (OR 4.54, p<0.001), measles (OR 15.45, p <0.001) and mumps (OR 3.1, p <0.001), as compared to those 65+. Many LTx candidates with cystic fibrosis (CF) had undetectable virus-specific antibody titers including:13.5% for VZV, 19.1% for measles, and 15.7% for mumps with significant odds of undetectable titers for VZV (OR 4.54, p<0.001) and measles (OR 2.32, p=0.010) as compared to those without CF. Therefore, a substantial number of patients undergoing LTx evaluation had undetectable virus-specific antibody titers. Our results emphasize the importance of screening for immunity to vaccine-preventable infections in this population and the need for revaccination in selected patients to boost their humoral immunity prior to transplantation.","Hostetler, Haley; Neely, Megan L; Lydon, Elizabeth; Danziger-Isakov, Lara A; Todd, Jamie L; Palmer, Scott M",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840158/,388

As of November 11th, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 189 countries/regions around the world, with a total of 51,510,611 confirmed cases and more than 1,275,211 deaths, with a global fatality rate of 2.48% (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Therefore, countries are facing lockdown crises and their populations face daily lives full of chaos, anxiety, and reorganization. The characteristics of this epidemic are most often described as ""unprecedented"" and replete with ""uncertainty"" (Davidson et al., 2020). In order to prevent the spread of this virus, health measures such as quarantine, wearing protective masks, and enforced lockdowns have been adopted by governments around the world, producing psychosocial (emotional distress, anxiety, suicide) and economic side-effects (Lima et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020). Despite its close geographical proximity to China, Taiwan's number of confirmed infections has been relatively small (584 people diagnosed as of November 11th, with 7 total COVID-19-related fatalities; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Taiwan's tragic experience 17 years ago with the SARS epidemic helped prepare the government to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 threat, make thorough preparations and advanced deployments, and formulate relevant anti-epidemic border control measures, quarantine and isolation measures, mask-wearing requirements, and public education strategies. Actions such as mask wearing, washing hands frequently, and practicing proper social distancing by the public and the government maintaining a master travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster (TOCC) database have proven effective in detecting and diagnosing cases early (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, providing first-line personnel with appropriate protective equipment, education, and training as well as timely and transparent information and epidemic prevention guidelines have kept nurses supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment, infection-prevention and control education, training and exercises, and sufficient professional knowledge and skills to provide care safely to patients (Chen et al., 2020; Huang & Chen, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Concurrently, it has been a challenge to nursing educators regarding how to suspend classes while not stopping academic education and to plan meaningful, alternative clinical experiences during the pandemic (Morin, 2020) and how to redefine and evaluate student performance to maintain teaching quality and learning effectiveness. In addition, ""disaster nursing"" is a critical area of professional knowledge for nurses in the 21st century, and all nurses should have an appropriate level of competence in professional disaster nursing. Therefore, core concepts related to infection control, disasters, and disaster preparedness should be incorporated into the curriculum and objectives. Finally, although we in Taiwan have faced the COVID-19 challenge in an environment in which the pandemic risk has been relatively well controlled, our daily lives are no longer taken for granted. When we look back on this experience, what will we learn from these experiences and how will this experience change how we approach healthcare and pandemic threats in the future? These changes will bring us more thoughts and challenges in nursing.","Chen, Shu-Ling",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202012_67(6).01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274419/,388

Patients' and treatment providers' (physicians and therapists) evaluated digital conversation-based consultations as well as the digital delivery of practical exercises. Methods: Digital consultations between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 were identified. Between June and July 2020, patients and treatment providers completed online questionnaires addressing challenges and advantages of their digital consultations. Both groups documented their satisfaction and working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory). In addition, semistructured qualitative interviews with treatment providers were conducted. Findings: A total of 82 online surveys (response rate 47%) about the digital consultations were available for analyses, with 60 patients correctly identifying at least one treatment provider, and 9 interviews were performed. Patients and treatment providers overall evaluated the new setting of digital consultation as feasible and an efficient consultation format. Interestingly, the working alliance was rated as good. Technical problems were mentioned as the main challenge and the delivery of practical exercises in digital consultations was seen more challenging than having digital conversation-based consultations. Conclusion: Digital consultations were established with overall positive evaluations and with a good working alliance between patients and providers. For the delivery of practical exercises it might be required to develop more innovative digital settings to overcome shortcomings of the digital format. Hybrid settings that combine the best of both settings could be a good option for future in postpandemic times.","Barth, Jürgen; Canella, Claudia; Oehler, Manuela; Witt, Claudia M",Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2020.0539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960805/,388

Moreover, numerous reports indicate that surgical correction of GERD may control the decline in lung function characteristic of BOS. Although laparoscopic fundoplication is an accepted treatment option for these patients with GERD, the surgical technique, which often includes a laparoscopic pyloroplasty, has not been standardized. METHODS The purpose of this article is to describe a step-by-step approach to the laparoscopic treatment of GERD in lung transplant patients. We also address specific technical concerns encountered in the surgical management of this high-risk patient population; we provide data on the safety of this operation; and we illustrate the evidence-based rationale for each technical step of the procedure.","Davis, Christopher S; Jellish, W Scott; Fisichella, P Marco",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-010-1233-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20499201/,388

Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m3 to 10 g/m3. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be spreading toward higher latitudes. Our findings suggest that there is an optimal climatic zone in which the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 markedly increases in the ambient environment (including the surfaces of objects).

159630,Teleophthalmology and its evolving role in a COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Manipulation of gene expression via recombinant viral vectors and creation of transgenic knock-out/in animals has revolutionized our understanding of genes that play critical roles during neuronal development and pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Recently, target-specific genetic manipulations are made possible to perform in combination with specific Cre-lines, albeit costly, labor-intensive and time consuming. Thus, alternative methods of gene manipulations to address important biological questions are highly desirable. In this study, we utilized in utero electroporation technique which involves efficient delivery of hindbrain-specific enhancer/promoter construct, Krox20 into the third ventricle of live mouse embryo to investigate green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression pattern in mouse auditory brainstem and other hindbrain neurons. RESULTS We created a GFP/DNA construct containing a Krox20 B enhancer and β-globin promoter to drive GFP expression in the hindbrain via injection into the third ventricle of E12 to E13.5 mice. Electrical currents were applied directly to the embryonic hindbrain to allow DNA uptake into the cell. Confocal images were then acquired from fixed brain slices to analyze GFP expression in mouse whole brain at different postnatal stages (P6-P21). By using a cell-type specific enhancer as well as region specific injection and electroporation, robust GFP expression in the cerebellum and auditory brainstem but not in the forebrain was observed. GFP expression in calyx of Held terminals was more robust in <P15 compared to >P15 mice. In contrast, GFP expression in MNTB neurons was more prevalent in >P15 compared to <P15. In regards to the relative expression of GFP versus the synaptic marker Vglut1, percentage fluorescence GFP intensity in the calyx was higher in P11 to P15 than P6 to P10 and P16 to P21 groups. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, this technique would potentially allow hindbrain-specific genetic manipulations such as knock-down, knock-in and rescue experiments to unravel critical molecular substrates underpinning functional and morphological remodeling of synapses as well as understanding the pathophysiology of certain neurological disorders targeting not only the auditory brainstem but also other parts of hindbrain, most notably the cerebellum.","David, Laurence S; Aitoubah, Jamila; Lesperance, Lee Stephen; Wang, Lu-Yang",Molecular brain,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13041-014-0051-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063346/,388

Materials and Methods: Aggregated encounter data were extracted for six service lines (dermatology, psychiatry, endocrinology, cardiology, orthopedics, and nonurgent primary care) in an integrated health system across three time periods: July 1 to September 30, 2019 (n = 239,803), July 1 to September 30, 2020 (n = 245,648), and December 29, 2019 to October 3, 2020 (n = 624,886). Risk ratios were calculated to assess the relative use of telemedicine compared with in-person encounters and telemedicine modality (i.e., synchronous audio/video vs. audio-only telephone) by patient race, age, sex, and insurance type. Results: By June 2020, total visit volume returned to prepandemic levels. Differences in patient demographics between July 1 to September 30, 2020 and the previous year's baseline were negligible. Telemedicine adoption varied by medical specialty, from 3.2% (dermatology) to 98.3% (psychiatry) of visits. African American and male patients were less likely to use telemedicine (telephone or video) compared with white and female patients. Among telemedicine encounters, African American, publicly insured, and older patients were less likely to use video compared with white, commercially insured, and younger patients.

AIM Our primary aim was to measure SRAE during RFA. Secondary aims were to identify risk factors for adverse events, and to determine whether SRAEs impacted the number of RFA treatments to achieve complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D). METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 consecutive patients undergoing initial RFA for dysplastic BE between 2008 and 2014. The main outcome measures were SRAEs and the number of RFA sessions required to achieve CE-D. RESULTS Of 120 initial RFA procedures, 83 % were performed with MAC and 17 % with GET. SRAEs occurred in 32 %, including 25 % of MAC patients (25/100) and 65 % (12/20) GET patients. The most frequent SRAE was hypotension (23 %, n = 27/120), followed by hypoxia (n = 9/120), arrhythmia (n = 4/120), and one unplanned intubation. There were no premature procedure terminations. After adjusting for length of BE mucosa and ASA score, the occurrence of a SRAE was associated with requiring more (>4) RFA sessions to achieve CE-D, OR 3.45 (95 % CI 1.49-7.99). Mean RFA sessions required to achieve CE-D was 5 ± 1 in patients with SRAE, compared to 3 ± 0.7 in patients without SRAE during the first treatment session (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS SRAE during RFA for dysplastic BE occurs at a rate typical of other advanced endoscopic procedures. Patients who experience minor events related to anesthesia during the first RFA are likely to require more RFA treatment sessions to achieve CE-D.","Mizrahi, Meir; Sengupta, Neil; Pleskow, Douglas K; Chuttani, Ram; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Berzin, Tyler M",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-016-4059-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894399/,388

This study aimed to investigate the differences in our surgical approach to kidney stone cases between the COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 period. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) for kidney stones in our clinic between March 11, 2020, and September 11, 2020, and those in the same period 1 year ago were included in the study. Demographic information, laboratory data, stone characteristics, treatment choices and results were evaluated comparatively. Results: A total of 39 patients in the COVID-19 period (group 1) and 93 patients in the pre- COVID-19 period (group 2) underwent kidney stone surgery. While RIRS was performed to 32 of the patients in group 1, PNL was applied to seven of the patients in group 2. RIRS was performed to 70 patients in group 2, and PNL was applied to 23 of them. While the RIRS/PNL ratio was 4.5 in group 1, it was 3.04 in group 2. During the COVID-19 period, the number of patients who underwent PNL has decreased significantly. Conclusion: The number of elective surgery cases has significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is predicted that the incidence of organ loss will increase due to complications and delayed treatment. Moreover, interruption of the residents' surgical training secondary to the decreasing number of cases is one of the pandemic's critical drawbacks.","Batur, A.

172015,Diagnosed and Undiagnosed COVID-19 in US Emergency Department Health Care Personnel: A Cross-sectional Analysis,2021,"Background & Aim: In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), NMDP guidelines are for stem cell product (SCP) infusion within 48 hrs or as soon as feasible after collection. However, given the possibility of long transit times, staffing limitations, and travel disruptions from natural disasters or pandemics, delays occur in the timing of infusions. We performed a pilot study to evaluate the safety of delayed SCP infusions. Methods, Results & Conclusion: We prospectively determined total transit time (time from end of collection to end of HCT infusion, TTT), viability, and product characteristics of SCP infused <48 or ≥48 hrs after collection. Differences in post-HCT outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and two-tailed t tests. We also retrospectively analyzed an independent cohort of SCP that required mandatory cryopreservation during the COVID- 19 pandemic. [Figure presented] In the <48 hr cohort (n=36), median TTT was 34.9 hrs. Median viability on arrival and at time of HCT were each 100%, with median infused CD34 dose of 5.58E6/kg. In the ≥48 hr cohort (n=23) median TTT was 58.1 hrs. Median product viability on arrival and at time of HCT were 100% and 99%, and median infused CD34 dose was 5.91E6/kg. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was longer for <48 hr cohort (p=0.048). Grade III/IV infusion reactions were 2.8% for <48 hr cohort, and primary graft failure was 2.8%;neither event occurred in >48 hrs cohort. Acute GVHD was 50% and 56.5%, and death from any cause was 39.9% versus 39.1%, in the <48 vs. ≥48 hr cohort groups. Death from any cause was seen in 39.9% versus 39.1% subjects, with median follow-up of 21 vs 13 months. 44 patients with SCPs (PBSC 86.4%, BM 13.6%) cryopreserved prior to HCT due to the COVID-19 pandemic response were also reviewed. Median infused CD34/kg was 5.5E6, with a median of 16 and 25 days for neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Grade III/IV infusion reactions and secondary graft failure were seen in 1 patient each (2.3%). Death from any cause was seen in 20.5% with a median follow-up of 5 months. Infusion of SCP products?>48 hrs was associated with no adverse outcomes post-HCT, compared to published parameters. In comparison, cryopreserved products during COVID-19 pandemic showed a delayed time to engraftment. While more definitive randomized studies are necessary, our preliminary results suggest that holding products for >48 hrs may be an acceptable alternative to cryopreservation in times of possible transit delay.

The data was collected through interviews with key institutional actors and triangulated against decrees, circulars, ordinances and other publicly available documents.FindingsThe accounting tools of governmentality are always incomplete. Sometimes unique situations and crises help us to revise and improve the tools we have. Other times, they demand entirely new tools.Research limitations/implicationsAccounting needs both things to count and a context to count them. In the case of food assistance, what is counted is people. In Turin's case, many people had never been counted – either because there was no need or because they were unaccounted for by choice. Now, the government was accountable for the welfare of both. Thus, new classification systems emerged, as did organisational and accounting solutions.Originality/valueAlthough the accounting-for-disasters literature is diverse, studies too often favour the macro social, economic and political issues surrounding crises, neglecting the micro issues associated with governmentality and calculative practices.","Sargiacomo, Massimo Corazza Laura D039; Andreamatteo, Antonio Dumay John Guthrie James","Accounting, Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal",https://doi.org/10.1108/aaaj-09-2020-4926,388

Horse polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV was bound onto the PZ crystal surface in an ordered orientation through protein A. The antigen sample was atomized into aerosol by an ultrasonator, by which the antibody on the crystal could specifically adsorb SARS antigen and the changed mass of crystal would lead a frequency shift. A frequency counter was employed to record the admittance frequency, and the plot of changed frequency was displayed on the computer. Under the optimized conditions, the frequency shifts were linearly dependent on antigen concentration in the range of 0.6-4 microg/mL. The device has good reproducibility (could be reused 100 times without detectable loss of activity), stability (the immunosensor was stable for more than two months when stored over silica gel blue at 4-6 degrees C), short analyzing time (less than 2 min), and specificity.","Zuo, Boli; Li, Shanmao; Guo, Zhao; Zhang, Jinfang; Chen, Chuanzhi",Analytical chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15228322/,388

192678,SARS: are we still at risk?,2006,"OBJECTIVE To systematically summarize the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Weipu Database, and Wanfang Database were searched for clinical studies on COVID-19 in children published up to May 21, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the studies included. A descriptive analysis was then performed for the studies. Related indices between children with COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were compared. RESULTS A total of 75 studies were included, with a total of 806 children with COVID-19. The research results showed that the age of the children ranged from 36 hours after birth to 18 years, with a male-female ratio of 1.21 : 1. Similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 often occurred with familial aggregation, and such cases accounted for 74.6% (601/806). The children with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS had similar clinical symptoms, mainly fever and cough. Some children had gastrointestinal symptoms. The children with asymptomatic infection accounted for 17.9% (144/806) of COVID-19 cases, 2.5% (2/81) of SARS cases, and 57.1% (12/21) of MERS cases. The children with COVID-19 and MERS mainly had bilateral lesions on chest imaging examination, with a positive rate of lesions of 63.4% (421/664) and 26.3% (5/19) respectively, which were lower than the corresponding positive rates of viral nucleic acid detection, which were 99.8% and 100% respectively. The chest radiological examination of the children with SARS mainly showed unilateral lesion, with a positive rate of imaging of 88.9% (72/81), which was higher than the corresponding positive rate of viral nucleic acid detection (29.2%). Viral nucleic acid was detected in the feces of children with COVID-19 or SARS, with positive rates of 60.2% (56/93) and 71.4% (5/7) respectively. The children with COVID-19 had a rate of severe disease of 4.6% (31/686) and a mortality rate of 0.1% (1/806), the children with SARS had a rate of severe disease of 1.5% (1/68) and a mortality rate of 0%, and those with MERS had a rate of severe disease of 14.3% (3/21) and a mortality rate of 9.5% (2/21). CONCLUSIONS Children with COVID-19 have similar symptoms to those with SARS or MERS, mainly fever and cough. Asymptomatic infection is observed in all three diseases. Children with COVID-19 or SARS have milder disease conditions than those with MERS. COVID-19 in children often occurs with familial aggregation. Epidemiological contact history, imaging examination findings, and viral nucleic acid testing results are important bases for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","He, Yang; Tang, Jun; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Hao-Ran; Li, Wen-Xing; Xiong, Tao; Li, You-Ping; Mu, De-Zhi",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800031/,388

The presence of VLPs was examined biochemically, following centrifugation of the supernatants collected from transfected cells through sucrose cushions and immunoblotting, and by electron-microscopic analysis. It is demonstrated that the matrix (M1) protein is the only viral component which is essential for VLP formation and that the viral ribonucleoproteins are not required for virus particle formation. It is also shown that the M1 protein, when expressed alone, assembles into virus-like budding particles, which are released in the culture medium, and that the recombinant M1 protein accumulates intracellularly, forming tubular structures. All these results are discussed with regard to the roles played by the virus polypeptides during virus assembly.","Gómez-Puertas, P; Albo, C; Pérez-Pastrana, E; Vivo, A; Portela, A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090151/,388

Objective To assess levels of anxiety and depression among medical students during initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal and relate their distress to relevant variables. Method A cross-sectional study with online questionnaire was conducted among medical students at different colleges in Nepal. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) detected 'anxiety' and 'depression'. The covariates were explored by logistic regression analyses. Result A total 416 medical students [mean age: 22.2 (2.1); males 57.7%, females 42.3%] participated. HADS-anxiety scores [mean: 7.1(4.3)] were significantly and positively correlated with HADS-depression [mean: 5.9 (4.1)] (r=0.695; p < 0.001). Point prevalence of total HADS caseness (HADS-T) was 26.7%. Specific HADS-defined caseness were: anxiety (HADS-A) 11.8%, depression (HADS-D) 5.5%, and comorbid anxiety and depression (HADS-cAD) 9.4%. All four types of caseness were significantly more prevalent among students with a history of mental problems (AOR=4.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively). HADS-T was higher among those with a concurrent physical illness (AOR=2.4). HADS-T, HADS-A and HADS-D scores were higher among the age group > 22 years (AOR= 2.2, 2.5 and 4.4 respectively). HADS-cAD was almost threetimes higher among those with a possible COVID-19 exposure (AOR=2.8). Conclusion A significant number of medical students in Nepal suffered from high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 shut-down. The students in the higher (> 22 years) age group, those with past mental disorders, possible COVID-19 exposure, and concurrent physical illness showed elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression.","Risal, A; Shikhrakar, S; Mishra, S; Kunwar, D; Karki, E; Shrestha, B; Khadka, S; Holen, A",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165087/,388

MATERIALS AND METHODS The SILS Port, initially designed for laparoscopic surgery, was successfully used for 20 TEM procedures in 16 patients. Local resection was sufficient in 15 procedures (benign tumours or pT1) out of 20, whereas 5 TEM operations required additional surgery: 3 rectal resections (pT1Nx, pT1sm3Nx and pT2N1) and 1 TEM revision (1 patient refused the rectal resection (pT1Nx). Postoperative complications following Dindo-Clavien were: grade II in 4 patients (pain: 2; fever: 1; bleeding: 1) and grade IIIb in 2 patients (bleeding). No long-term faecal incontinence was noted. CONCLUSION TEM using the SILS Port is a safe and effective procedure for local resection of benign and certain malignant tumours. Using such a cheaper device, TEM procedure could be available in any operating theatre.","Mansvelt, B; Dili, A; Molle, G; Stangherlin, P; Bertrand, Cl",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24224431/,388

In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases. The scientifi c community has played an exemplary role in responding to this global emergency, working to fi nd timely, relevant solutions for governments and society as a whole.

ARDS is a severe syndrome of acute lung injury (ALI) that is predominantly triggered by inflammation and results in a sudden loss of, or damage to, kidney function. Emerging studies reveal that multiple transcription factor-associated signaling pathways are activated in the pathology of ALI/ARDS. Of these pathways, the activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), AP-1 (activator protein 1), IRFs (interferon regulatory factors), STATs (signal transducer and activator of transcription), Wnt/β-catenin-TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor), and CtBP2 (C-Terminal binding protein 2)-associated transcriptional complex contributes to ALI/ARDS pathology through diverse mechanisms, such as inducing proinflammatory cytokine levels and mediating macrophage polarization. In this review, we present an updated summary of the mechanisms underlying these signaling activations and regulations, as well as their contribution to the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. We aim to develop a better understanding of how ALI/ARDS occurs and improve ALI/ARDS therapy.","Chen, Zhi; Hua, Shan",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042442/,388

199213,SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in blood in a large school community subject to a Covid-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study,2020,"The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in 2000 is an important event in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) story. This enzyme, an homolog of ACE, hydrolyzes angiotensin (Ang) I to produce Ang-(1-9), which is subsequently converted into Ang-(1-7) by a neutral endopeptidase and ACE. ACE2 releases Ang-(1-7) more efficiently than its catalysis of Ang-(1-9) by cleavage of Pro(7)-Phe(8) bound in Ang II. Thus, the major biologically active product of ACE2 is Ang-(1-7), which is considered to be a beneficial peptide of the RAS cascade in the cardiovascular system. This enzyme has 42% identity with the catalytic domain of ACE, is present in most cardiovascular-relevant tissues, and is an ectoenzyme as ACE. Despite these similarities, ACE2 is distinct from ACE. Since it is a monocarboxypeptidase, it has only 1 catalytic site and is insensitive to ACE inhibitors. As a result, ACE2 is a central enzyme in balancing vasoconstrictor and proliferative actions of Ang II with vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects of Ang-(1-7). In this review, we will summarize the role of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system and discuss the importance of ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis in the control of normal cardiovascular physiology and ACE2 as a potential target in the development of novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.","Raizada, Mohan K; Ferreira, Anderson J",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17703127/,388

206818,The Metrics Matter: Improving Comparisons of COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes,2021,"Background Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the cases of a significant proportion of patients are severe. A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19. Methods A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. Results The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19. Conclusions Some urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity.","Liu, Rui; Ma, Qingfeng; Han, Huan; Su, Hanwen; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kailang; Wang, Wei; Zhu, Chengliang",Clin Chem Lab Med,,388

216906,Temporal Trends in Lower-Limb Major and Minor Amputation and Revascularization Procedures in People With Diabetes in England During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine video visits are an under-utilized form of delivering health care. However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, practices are rapidly adapting telemedicine for patient care. We describe our experience in rapidly introducing video visits in a tertiary academic pediatric urology practice, serving primarily rural patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess visit success rate and identify barriers to completing video visits. The secondary aim identified types of pathologies feasible for video visits and travel time saved. We hypothesize socioeconomic status is a predictor of a successful visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was prospectively collected and analyzed on video visits focusing on visit success, defined by satisfactory completion of the visit as assessed by the provider. Other variables collected included duration, video platform and technical problems. Retrospective data was collected via chart review and analyzed including demographics, insurance, and distance to care. Socioeconomic status was estimated using the Distressed Communities Index generated for patient zip code. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Out of 116 attempted visits, 81% were successful. The top two reasons for failure were ""no-show"" (64%) and inability to connect (14%). Success versus failure of visit was similar for patient age (p = 0.23), sex (p = 0.42), type of visit (initial vs. established) (p = 0.51), and socioeconomic status (p = 0.39). After adjusting for race, socioeconomic status, and type of provider, having public insurance remained a significant predictor of failure (p = 0.017). Successful visits were conducted on multiple common pediatric urologic problems (excluding visits requiring palpation on exam), and video was sufficient for physical exams in most cases (Summary Table). A median of 2.25 h of travel time was saved. CONCLUSIONS: While socioeconomic status, estimated using the Distressed Communities Index, did not predict success of video visits, patients with public insurance were more likely to have a failed video visit. There is compelling evidence that effective video visits for certain pathologies can be rapidly achieved in a pediatric urology practice with minimal preparation time.","Winkelman, Andrew J; Beller, Haerin L; Morgan, Kathryn E; Corbett, Sean T; Leroy, Susan V; Noona, Sean W; Berry, Kaitlin L; Kern, Nora G",J Pediatr Urol,,388

218581,COVID-19 pandemic: changes in cancer admissions,2020,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) pandemic has pushed health workers to find creative solutions to a global shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE). 3D-printing technology is having an essential role during the pandemic providing solutions for this problem, for instance, modifying full-face snorkel masks or creating low-cost face shields to use as PPE (Ishack and Lipner, 2020 [1]). Otolaryngologists are at increased occupational risk to COVID19 infection due to the exposure to respiratory droplets and aerosols, especially during the routine nose and mouth examinations where coughing and sneezing happen regularly (Rna et al., 2017 [2]; Tysome and Bhutta, 2020 [3]). The use of a headlight is essential during these examinations. However, to our knowledge, none of the commercially available or 3D-printable face shields are compatible with a headlight. Hence, using a face shield and a headlight at the same time can be very uncomfortable and sometimes impossible. To solve this problem, we have designed a 3D-printable adapter for medical headlights, which can hold a transparent sheet to create a face shield as an effective barrier protection that can be used comfortably with the headlight. The adapter can be printed in different materials with the most commonly used nowadays being the cost-efficient PLA (Polylactic Acid) used for this prototype. The resulting piece weighs only 7 g and has an estimated cost of $0.15 USD. The transparent sheets, typically made from polyester and used for laser printing, can be purchased in any office material store with a standard price of 0.4 USD per unit. After use, the transparent sheet can be easily removed. We trialed the adapter in 7 different headlights. All of these headlights accommodated the printed blocks extremely well. The headlights were used in many different settings, including the ENT clinic, the operating room, the emergency room, the ENT ward and the COVID19 intensive care unit (ICU) for a two weeks period. All doctors using the headlight felt they were fully protected from respiratory droplets, blood, sputum and other fluids. The face shield with the headlight has been found very useful for treating epistaxis, changing tracheostomy cannulas and during routine nasal and oral examinations. The headlight face shield adapter was designed to solve a specific problem among the ENT community; however other specialist can find it useful as well. Nonetheless, manufacturers should take care of specifics problems like this and provide commercially available products to protect the ENT workforce in this new era.","Viera-Artiles, Jaime; Valdiande, José J",Am J Otolaryngol,,388

Less is known about how COVID-19 has impacted psychiatric emergency services (PES). This report compares visits to the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs psychiatric emergency room from March-August 2020 to the same period from three prior years (2017, 2018, 2019) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patient volume and dispositions. Compared to prior years, there was a decline in visits in March-August 2020, particularly in April. This coincided with the peak of COVID-19 in the state. Rates of hospitalizations remained consistent, while rates of referrals to residential programs decreased. The decline in visits likely indicates that many veterans postponed necessary mental health and substance use treatment. This delay could have significant clinical ramifications for veterans and may lead to an eventual surge in demand for emergency mental health care.","Mitchell, Lorena; Fuehrlein, Brian",Community ment. health j,,388

STUDY DESIGN: This observational longitudinal cohort study of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-and their infants at 3 NYU Langone Health hospitals was conducted between March 25, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding predelivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Of the 160 mother-newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. There was no significant difference in the predelivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads both in the hospital (P < .001) and at home (P = .012). Only 2 mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change in the separated group (49.0% vs 16.7%; P < .001). When the dyads were further stratified by symptom status into 4 groups-asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated-the results remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of COVID-19, separation of mother-newborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants. No evidence of vertical transmission was observed; 1 case of postnatal transmission occurred from an unmasked symptomatic mother who held her infant at birth.","Popofsky, Stephanie; Noor, Asif; Leavens-Maurer, Jill; Quintos-Alagheband, Maria Lyn; Mock, Ann; Vinci, Alexandra; Magri, Eileen; Akerman, Meredith; Noyola, Estela; Rigaud, Mona; Pak, Billy; Lighter, Jennifer; Ratner, Adam J; Hanna, Nazeeh; Krilov, Leonard",J. pediatr.

Quarantine measures have forced people to stay inside their homes, leading to the “new normal” of living and adaptation. One activity that has been among Filipinos during the onset of the lockdown until the present time is the increased engagement in gardening. Home gardening suddenly became a widespread activity in rural and urban areas. The use of the words “plantito” [male] and “plantita” [female] denote someone who enjoys taking care of plants. This qualitative study aims to explore and describe the rise of home gardening among Filipinos during the pandemic. A total of 104 participants answered an online survey containing open-ended questions. They described a “plantito/plantita” as a plant lover and nurturer and reported home gardening as a way of connecting with nature, a psychological experience, and an interest. The benefits include stress relief and improved mood.

A successful vaccination campaign is widely viewed as the only way to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, placing greater urgency on the need for a rapid vaccination strategy. In this paper, we present emerging findings, from a national research study, that document the key challenges faced by current vaccine rollout strategies, which include procurement and leadership strategies, citizen engagement and limitations in supply chain capacity. These findings are used to inform a scalable vaccine strategy comprising collaborative leadership, mobilization of an integrated workforce and a digitally enabled supply chain strategy. The goal of vaccinating the entire Canadian population in the next few months can be achieved when supported by such a strategy.","Snowdon, Anne W; Wright, Alexandra; Saunders, Michael",Healthc Q,,388
226814,End-of-Life Decisions in Albania: The Call for an Ethical Revision,2020,"Protected areas (PAs) are the cornerstone of global conservation policy and have expanded dramatically over the last century. Though unequivocally beneficial for biodiversity, gazetting land for protecting nature can also be seen as an 'opportunity cost' that some politicians are unwilling to pay. One of the most effective strategies to increase the political resilience of PAs in the face of such threats is to demonstrate their broader value to society. This is one of the objectives of the recently proposed 'PA asset framework'. The framework conceptualizes PAs as being composed of suites of biophysical, human, infrastructure, institutional and cultural assets that interact with individuals and institutions to generate different forms of tangible and intangible value. Here, we test the utility of the framework by conducting an asset-based analysis of Brazilian National Parks (NPs) at two different scales (NP system and NP unit). Assets were identified at the system level through a systematic review of 49 Management Plans (MPs) using a typology of PA asset classes as a tool for characterising the presence and state of assets in or associated with NPs. At the NP unit level, assets were identified through semi-structured interviews with local managers of the Chapada Diamantina National Park. Biophysical and infrastructure assets were the most represented asset classes at both scales. Our analysis successfully revealed: (i) which assets can be managed to generate wider forms of values at local scale (e.g. natural spectacles, iconic species, park volunteers) (ii) relational values between assets (e.g. trails and outdoor recreational features), and (iii) value generating practices (VGPs) to capture values from the interaction between different assets (i.e. restoration of degraded areas through voluntary programmes, etc.). We conclude by discussing how the PA asset framework can be operatively integrated into NP management to improve the future allocation of limited financial resources.","Bragagnolo, Chiara; Correia, Ricardo A; Gamarra, Norah Costa; Lessa, Thainá; Jepson, Paul; Malhado, Ana C M; Ladle, Richard J",J Environ Manage,,388

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE. CONCLUSION: The indicators under analysis could be used regularly, with special attention to viral pneumonias, to detect outbreaks of COVID-19. Information on pneumonia of unknown etiology may be considered in the surveillance of COVID-19.","Torres, Ana Rita; Silva, Susana; Kislaya, Irina; Martins, João Pedro; Matias Dias, Carlos; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta Med Port,,388

234914,58 Bioethics support in a tertiary children’s hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus and is responsible for the current pandemic. It mainly infects cells of the lower respiratory tract and has been linked to severe respiratory complications. Although multiple routes of transmission have been reported in the literature, there is no definitive evidence for transplacental transmission. We present a case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 likely due to transplacental transmission. CASE REPORT 31-year-old Hispanic woman in the final week of pregnancy developed mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gestational diabetes. Two days later, she gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the first day after birth. She was delivered via elective cesarean section adhering to a strict infection control protocol. CONCLUSIONS This report presents a case of a 31-year-old mother with mild symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and who gave birth to a baby girl who was also positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case supports the possibility of transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Majachani, Nicole; Francois, Jean Luc M; Fernando, Ashen K; Zuberi, Jamshed",Am J Case Rep,,388
235007,41 Adapting a 2 day communication skills course for the covid-19 clinical and learning environment. Feedback and evaluations from day 1,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has immensely changed people's travel behaviour. The changes in travel behaviour have had a huge impact on different industries, such as consumption, entertainment, commerce, office, and education. This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on population travel patterns from three aspects: total trips, travel recovery degree, and travel distance. The result indicates that COVID-19 has reduced the total number of cross-city trips and flexible non-work travel;in the post-pandemic era, cross-city travel is mainly short-distance (distance <100 km). This study has significant policymaking implications for governments in countries where the population shares a similar change in travel behaviour.","Wang, Xuyang Pei Tao Li Kaixi Cen Yan Shi Miao Zhuo Xian Mao Tianyu","Cities (London, England)",,388
235765,Predicting COVID-19 at skilled nursing facilities in California: do the stars align?,2021,"COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viral (non-CoV-2-RV) infections are associated with thrombotic complications. The differences in prothrombotic potential between SARS-CoV-2 and non-CoV-2-RV have not been well characterised. We compared the thrombotic rates between these two groups of patients directly and further delved into their coagulation profiles. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients admitted between January 15th and April 10th 2020 were included. Coagulation parameters studied were prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and its associated clot waveform analysis (CWA) parameter, min1, min2 and max2. In the COVID-19 (n = 181) group there were two (1.0 event/1000-hospital-days) myocardial infarction events while one (1.8 event/1000-hospital-day) was reported in the non-CoV-2-RV (n = 165) group. These events occurred in patients who were severely ill. There were no venous thrombotic events. Coagulation parameters did not differ throughout the course of mild COVID-19. However, CWA parameters were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 compared with mild disease, suggesting hypercoagulability (min1: 6.48%/s vs 5.05%/s, P < 0.001; min2: 0.92%/s2 vs 0.74%/s2, P = 0.033). In conclusion, the thrombotic rates were low and did not differ between COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients. The hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is a highly dynamic process with the highest risk occurring when patients were most severely ill. Such changes in haemostasis could be detected by CWA. In our population, a more individualized thromboprophylaxis approach, considering clinical and laboratory factors, is preferred over universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and such personalized approach warrants further research.","Tan, Chuen Wen; Tan, Jing Yuan; Wong, Wan Hui; Cheong, May Anne; Ng, Ian Matthias; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ng, Heng Joo; Lee, Lai Heng",Sci Rep,,388
235830,Challenges with healthcare workers' protection during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran,2021,"Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.","Hanff, Thomas C; Harhay, Michael O; Brown, Tyler S; Cohen, Jordana B; Mohareb, Amir M",Clin Infect Dis,,388

In the 21st century, (bio)technological advances have paved the way for developing prophylactic vaccines that are safer and more effective as well as enabling the use of vaccines as therapeutics to treat human diseases. Here, we provide a focused review of the utility of genetic code expansion as an emerging tool for the development of vaccines. Specifically, we discuss how the incorporation of immunogenic noncanonical amino acids can aid in eliciting immune responses against adverse self-proteins and highlight the potential of an expanded genetic code for the construction of replication-incompetent viruses. We close the review by discussing the future prospects and remaining challenges for the application of these approaches in the development of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in the near future.","Fok, Jelle A; Mayer, Clemens",Chembiochem,,388

Each specimen has probability $p$ of being contaminated, independently of the other specimens. Suppose we can repeatedly take small portions from several specimens, mix them together, and test the mixture for contamination, so that if the test turns positive, then at least one of the samples in the mixture is contaminated. In this paper we consider a binary search scheme for determining all contaminated specimens. More precisely, we study the number $T(N)$ of tests required in order to find all the contaminated specimens, if this search scheme is applied. We derive recursive and, in some cases, explicit formulas for the expectation, the variance, and the characteristic function of $T(N)$. Also, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the moments of $T(N)$ as $N \to \infty$ and from that we obtain the limiting distribution of $T(N)$ (appropriately normalized), which turns out to be normal.","Papanicolaou, Vassilis G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11910v3.pdf,388

In this retrospective study, serum calcium levels, hormone levels and clinical laboratory parameters on admission were recorded. The clinical outcome variables were also recorded. From February 10 to February 28, 2020, 241 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 180 (74.7%) had hypocalcemia on admission. The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, and median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with VD levels (P =0.004) but negatively correlated with PTH levels (P =0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially &#8804;2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidences of organ injury and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and 28-day mortality were 0.923 (P <0.001), 0.905 (P =0.001), and 0.929 (P <0.001), respectively.

The aim of this paper is to present the major economic crises and their effect on healthcare and social system chronologically. Bismarck's and Beveridge's model, the two most prominent healthcare models, which emerged primarily as a response to major economic crises, constitute the basis for the functioning of most health care systems in the world. An overview of historical events and experiences may be valuable in predicting future developments and potential effects of the crisis on healthcare systems and health in general. An analysis of past crises as well as current health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the healthcare system can facilitate the comprehension of the mechanisms of action and consequences of economic recession. It may also help identify guidelines and changes that might reduce the potential damage caused by future crises. The historical examples presented show that a crisis could trigger changes, which, in theiressence, are not necessarily negative. The response of society as a whole determines the direction of these changes, and it is up to society to transform the negative circumstances brought about by the recession into activities that contribute to general well-being and progress.","Kastelan, Snjezana; Kasun, Boris; Kastelan, Ursula; Radonjic, Milena; Sopta, Martina",Acta Med Hist Adriat,,388

Each report is subject to a public meeting by one of three independent expert committees (the California Technology Assessment Forum [CTAF], Midwest Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council [CEPAC], and New England CEPAC) discusses the report and votes on the evidence presented. This research compares and contrasts outcomes by committee. Methods: All publicly available final ICER reports of pharmaceuticals (01/01/2014-12/31/2019) were screened and key data extracted. Results: 38 ICER reports of pharmaceuticals were identified (CTAF: 11; Midwest CEPAC: 12; New England CEPAC: 15), encompassing 110 drugs in 78 conditions/subgroups. Clinical ratings were provided for 277 drug comparisons (CTAF: 41; Midwest CEPAC: 46; New England CEPAC: 190). For the CTAF, Midwest CEPAC, New England CEPAC, respectively, 19 (46%), 23 (50%), and 33 (17%) drug comparisons achieved a rating of A, B, or B+; 3 (7%), 9 (20%), and 80 (42%) achieved a rating of C, C+, C-, or D; 19 (46%), 14 (30%), and 77 (41%) achieved a rating of P/I or I. Cost-utility assessments were undertaken for 117 treatment settings (CTAF: 35; Midwest CEPAC: 32; New England CEPAC: 50). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, 11 therapies (31%) were deemed cost-effective/cost-saving by the CTAF, 9 (28%) by the Midwest CEPAC, and 21 (42%) by the New England CEPAC. Of the 51 votes for healthcare value, most drugs had a majority vote of low or intermediate value: CTAF: 9 (90%); Midwest CEPAC: 12 (86%); New England CEPAC: 22 (81%). Conclusions: There are generally few differences between ICER committee outcomes, although there are some variances, which are likely due to therapy area focus. Considering healthcare value, ICER committees are generally consistent in reporting that most drugs provide low to intermediate value.","Majeed, B.; Macaulay, R.; Tang, M.",Value Health,,388

People with Parkinson's Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing. Proactive use of virtual modalities for support groups and social prescribing should be explored.","Subramanian, Indu; Farahnik, Joshua; Mischley, Laurie K",NPJ Parkinsons Dis,,388

In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralised by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen by government regulators. We argue that now is the time for action to undertake development of such a system, not only because of the current crisis but also in anticipation of future crises resulting from geopolitical risks, the continued globalisation of the digital economy, and the changing value and risks that technology brings.","Goodell, Geoffrey; Al-Nakib, Hazem Danny; Tasca, Paolo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03023v2.pdf,388

To alleviate the burden of data annotation, we herein present a label-free approach for segmenting COVID-19 lesions in CT via voxel-level anomaly modeling that mines out the relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in the high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit strong patterns. To facilitate the learning of such patterns at a voxel level, we synthesize 'lesions' using a set of simple operations and insert the synthesized 'lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from which we learn a normalcy-recognizing network (NormNet) that recognizes normal tissues and separate them from possible COVID-19 lesions. Our experiments on three different public datasets validate the effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.","Yao, Qingsong; Xiao, Li; Liu, Peihang; Kevin Zhou, S",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,,388

258299,Index Symptoms and Prognosis Awareness of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer: A Multi-Site Palliative Care Collaborative,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic threatens both lives and livelihoods. To reduce the spread of the virus, governments have introduced crisis management interventions that include border closures, quarantines, strict social distancing, marshaling of essential workers and enforced homeworking. COVID-19 measures are necessary to save the lives of some of the most vulnerable people within society, and yet in parallel they create a range of negative everyday effects for already marginalized people. Likely unintended consequences of the management of the COVID-19 crisis include elevated risk for workers in low-paid, precarious, and care-based employment, over-representation of minority ethnic groups in case numbers and fatalities, and gendered barriers to work. Drawing upon feminist ethics of care, I theorize a radical alternative to the normative assumptions of rationalist crisis management. Rationalist approaches to crisis management are typified by utilitarian logics, masculine and militaristic language, and the belief that crises follow linear processes of signal detection, preparation/prevention, containment, recovery, and learning. By privileging the quantifiable - resources and measurable outcomes - such approaches tend to omit considerations of pre-existing structural disadvantage. This paper contributes a new theorization of crisis management that is grounded in feminist ethics to provide a care-based concern for all crisis affected people.","Branicki, Layla J","Gender, work and organization",,388
258848,Article prevalence and risk factors of coronavac side effects: An independent cross-sectional study among healthcare workers in turkey,2021,"Virus has become a global pandemic because of the rapid spread and imaginative numbers of cases and deaths. It becomes the most important issue that brings the attention of not only scientists but also the press, international and publishing houses, etc. All the countries involved all researches and centres efforts to find a vaccine or treatment to control it to no avail. This study not only investigates and explores the interaction between three types of medicine (Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, and Remdesivir), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptors but also comparing the results with the interaction between the active part of the virus (Spike protein (S1)) and the cell. All interactions and properties of all molecules have been studied theoretically using theoretical calculations and computational methods based on the density functional theory. The results indicate that one of the drugs, which is Remdesivir could be an effective barrier inhibits the bind of the S1 with the human cell. This result could be interpreted in terms of the binding energy, since the binding energy of the Remdesivir molecule with the ACE2 equals-8.564 eV, while the binding energy of S1 is-5.666 eV. This research also founds that the electrons transfer from the drug to the ACE2 is 10.873 e, which is higher than that of S1 (5.155e). In addition, the results exhibit the Hydroxychloroquine does not have enough capability to inhibit the binding process between the virus and the cell since its binding energy (-2.948 eV) and the number of electrons transfer (0.7670) are the lowest. Finally, the Fermi energies values of Remdesivir (-3.5 eV) and ACE2 (-3.4 eV) molecules are convergent. In the context of the elastic transport, this predication is an important result since it interprets the large number of electrons that have been transferred from Remdesivir to ACE2 molecule, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, and this introduces the Remdesivir as a promising drug.","Al-Owaedi, Oday A.; Khalil, Talat Tariq; Karim, Sadiq A.; Said, Mohammed Hamid; Al-Bermany, Ehssan; Taha, Dakhil N.",Syst.

259916,Risk of COVID-19 infection in workplace settings and the use of personal protective equipment,2020,"In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the failure of the cardiorespiratory system can be due to one of the following: (1) cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis ­ septic shock, (2) unmanageable hypoxemia, (3) isolated organ failure or as part of multi-organ failure. Herein we give an overview of the therapeutic options for treating or preventing these disease states. In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock. Inhalational nitric oxide (iNO), inhalational epoprostenol and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are options in severe hypoxemia that is unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.

Design/methodology/approach: Primary data were obtained from 92 community college entrepreneurship faculty via online survey in late March of 2020, right at the time faculty were required to transition their courses to an online mode of delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in partnership with the National Association for Community College Entrepreneurship and the Entrepreneurship Education Project. Findings: While the majority of community college entrepreneurship educators have taught online previously, many were not familiar with exemplar education technology tools and applications, demonstrating an opportunity for continued professional development. To deliver courses online, educators primarily relied on pre-recorded lectures and using Zoom as the technology platform of choice. Last, there were significant faculty concerns about their ability to effectively create an “experiential” classroom virtually for students to learn and practice entrepreneurship. Originality/value: This is the first paper investigating how community college entrepreneurship educators responded to one of the most disruptive events to ever impact entrepreneurship education (viz. the COVID-19 pandemic). More broadly, this is also one of very few studies exploring both (1) community college entrepreneurship education and (2) how unexpected crises (e.g. natural disasters, pandemics) impact educational environments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Liguori, E.

261489,"Side effects of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine: A randomized, cross-sectional study with detailed self-reported symptoms from healthcare workers",2021,"To limit the transmission of COVID-19, nationwide lockdown was imposed in France between March, 17th and May 10th, 2020. This disruption in individuals' daily routines likely altered food consumption habits. We examined how changes in food choice motives related to changes in nutritional quality during the lockdown compared to before. A convenience sample of 938 French adults completed online questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform at the end of April 2020. Participants were retrospectively asked about their food choice motives and food consumption during the month before and in the first month of the lockdown. The importance of nine food choice motives was assessed: health, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, ethical concern, weight control, mood, familiarity, and price, scoring from 1 to 4. Food intakes were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire including 110 foods, 12 non-alcoholic beverages and 4 alcoholic beverages. Adherence to the French dietary recommendations before and during the lockdown was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, scoring from -17 to 11.5. The nutritional quality of diet was lower during the lockdown compared to before (-0.32, SD 2.28, p < 0.001). Food choice motives significantly changed and an increase in the importance of weight control was associated with increased nutritional quality (ß = 0.89, p < 0.001, partial Î·2 = 0.032), whereas an increase in the importance of mood was associated with decreased nutritional quality (ß = -0.43, p = 0.021, partial Î·2 = 0.006). The lockdown period in France was related to a decrease in nutritional quality of diet on average, which could be partly explained by changes in food choice motives. The lockdown was indeed related to modification of food choice motives, notably with an increase of mood as a food choice motive for 48% of the participants, but also with an increase of health (26%), ethical concern (21%) and natural content (19%) suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable food choices in some participants.","Marty, Lucile; de Lauzon-Guillain, Blandine; Labesse, Maë; Nicklaus, Sophie",Appetite,,388

262090,Oral health condition and dental care in children with congenital heart disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review,2021,"Furin is a serine protease that takes part in the processing and activation of the host cell pre-proteins. The enzyme also plays an important role in the activation of several viruses like the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease with a high rate of virulence and mortality. Unlike viral enzymes, furin owns a constant sequence and active site characteristics and seems to be a better target for drug design for COVID-19 treatment. Considering furin active site as receptor and some approved drugs from different classes including antiviral, antibiotics, and anti protozoa/anti parasites with suspected beneficial effects on COVID-19, as ligands we have carried out docking experiments in HEX software to pickup those capable to bind furin active site with high affinity and suggest them as probable candidates for clinical trials assessments. Our docking experiments show that saquinavir, nelfinavir, and atazanavir with cumulative inhibitory effects of 2.52, 2.16, and 2.13 respectively seem to be the best candidates for furin inhibition even in severe cases of COVID-19 as adjuvant therapy, while clarithromycin, niclosamide, and erythromycin with cumulative inhibitory indices of 1.97, 1.90, and 1.84 respectively with lower side effects than antiviral drugs could be suggested as prophylaxes for the first stage of COVID-19 as a promising treat.","Dayer, Mohammad Reza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12799v1.pdf,388

271238,Virtual visits in palliative care: about time or against the grain?,2020,"Objectives: COVID-19 diagnostic testing has been a critical element of managing risk during the pandemic. Point-of-care rapid antigen tests have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among symptomatic individuals, as an alternative to the gold standard PCR-based tests (which have a much longer turnaround time). Inaccurate test results can detrimentally affect the spread of infection. In this study, we assessed false positives and false negatives reported for COVID-19 rapid antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), using FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database (a repository of deidentified reports of issues associated with authorized medical devices). Methods: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of false positives or false negatives associated with COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, from the date of the first EUA (05/08/2020) through 12/31/2020. When noted in the MAUDE report, off-label use of the test was recorded. Results: Five of the 11 authorized rapid antigen tests had false positive or false negative reports in the MAUDE database. Of the total 1816 reports, 1725 (95.0%) were false positives and 91 (5.0%) were false negatives. Off-label use in asymptomatic individuals was noted in 1024 (56.4%) reports. Conclusions: Our study found that nearly all erroneous results with rapid antigen tests reported to MAUDE were false positives, and half involved samples from asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that false negatives, which are more consequential for virus transmission, occur infrequently with rapid antigen tests. Limitations of this study include potential under-reporting to MAUDE, the unknown denominator of COVID-19 tests, and the inability to establish device malfunction in relation to aberrant results. This analysis provides important new insights into real-world use of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests and the potential negative ramifications of off-label use.","Zettler, M.; Gajra, A.; Feinberg, B.",Value in Health,,388

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between the frequencies of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections and air pollutants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were direct consequences of countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic. METHODS: Asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections among hospitalized children in the permanent population of Guangzhou City, China, from February to June 2016-2019 (before the pandemic) to February to June 2020 (during the pandemic) were collected in this cross-sectional study in Guangzhou. RESULTS: The number of asthma exacerbation cases per month documented in the Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital before (median: 13.5; range: 0-48) and during (median: 20; range: 0-34) the mitigative response to the COVID-19 pandemic was similar. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbation cases per month decreased, whereas that of mild asthma exacerbation cases per year increased (p = .004). The number of patients hospitalized with infectious respiratory diseases decreased from 146 (range: 90-172) per month before the pandemic to 42 (range: 33-57) per month during the pandemic (p = .004). Most pathogens and air pollutants decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbations positively correlated to that of respiratory infections in children, but did not correlate to air pollutants. CONCLUSION: Strict countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic were associated with a decreased the frequency of infectious respiratory diseases and severe asthma exacerbations among urban children.","Fan, Hui-Feng; He, Chun-Hui; Yin, Gen-Quan; Qin, Yi; Jiang, Nan; Lu, Gen; Li, Xing",Pediatr Pulmonol,,388

Significant differences were noted across job categories for stress and resilience, with nurses reporting highest PSS scores (effect estimates: -2.72, P = .009 for NMNPC; -2.50, P = .015 for NMPC; -3.21, P = .006 for MD/NP/PA respectively), and MD/NP/PA group with highest BRS scores: nurses (-0.31, P = .02); NMPC (-0.3333, P = .01); and NMNPC (-0.2828, P = .02). Younger personnel had higher stress (-1.59 per decade of age, P < .01) and more resilience (0.11 per decade of age, P = .002). CONCLUSION: These self-reported data indicate that MD/NP/PA had the highest resilience scores and the nurses had highest stress levels. Efforts are warranted to include all HCWs in systematic stress mitigating interventions with particular attention to understand specific factors contributing to stress for the nursing team.","Croghan, Ivana T; Chesak, Sherry S; Adusumalli, Jayanth; Fischer, Karen M; Beck, Elizabeth W; Patel, Shruti R; Ghosh, Karthik; Schroeder, Darrell R; Bhagra, Anjali",J Prim Care Community Health,,388

281277,Screening for Covid-19 in Skilled Nursing Facilities,2020,"Pregnant patients with COVID-19 are more likely to require intensive care and die compared with noninfected pregnant women. While the consequences of COVID-19 disease in pregnancy prompted many health care organizations to support vaccination in pregnancy, vaccine effects for mother and infant remained unclear. In this issue of the JCI, Beharier and Mayo et al. explored maternal and neonatal responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The authors examined blood samples from women and cord blood of neonates following childbirth. Samples were stratified into three groups: vaccine recipients, unvaccinated participants with past positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and unvaccinated participants without prior infection. Vaccinated mothers and mothers with previous infection generated and transferred protective IgG antibodies across the placenta. This study provides evidence to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy with protection to the neonate against infection, outlining clear vaccine benefits for both maternal and child health.","Burd, Irina; Kino, Tomoshige; Segars, James",J. clin. invest,,388

281593,Child in institutional quarantine - A unique challenge,2020,"BACKGROUND: The CNS manifestations of COVID-19 in children have primarily been described in case reports, which limit the ability to appreciate the full spectrum of the disease in paediatric patients. We aimed to identify enough cases that could be evaluated in aggregate to better understand the neuroimaging manifestations of COVID-19 in the paediatric population. METHODS: An international call for cases of children with encephalopathy related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and abnormal neuroimaging findings was made. Clinical history and associated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid data were requested. These data were reviewed by a central neuroradiology panel, a child neurologist, and a paediatric infectious diseases expert. The children were categorised on the basis of their time of probable exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, cases were excluded when a direct link to SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be established or an established alternate diagnostic cause could be hypothesised. The accepted referral centre imaging data, from ten countries, were remotely reviewed by a central panel of five paediatric neuroradiologists and a consensus opinion obtained on the imaging findings. FINDINGS: 38 children with neurological disease related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified from France (n=13), the UK (n=8), the USA (n=5), Brazil (n=4), Argentina (n=4), India (n=2), Peru (n=1), and Saudi Arabia (n=1). Recurring patterns of disease were identified, with neuroimaging abnormalities ranging from mild to severe. The most common imaging patterns were postinfectious immune-mediated acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like changes of the brain (16 patients), myelitis (eight patients), and neural enhancement (13 patients). Cranial nerve enhancement could occur in the absence of corresponding neurological symptoms. Splenial lesions (seven patients) and myositis (four patients) were predominantly observed in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Cerebrovascular complications in children were less common than in adults. Significant pre-existing conditions were absent and most children had favourable outcomes. However, fatal atypical CNS co-infections developed in four previously healthy children infected with SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Acute-phase and delayed-phase SARS-CoV-2-related CNS abnormalities are seen in children. Recurring patterns of disease and atypical neuroimaging manifestations can be found and should be recognised being as potentially due to SARS-CoV-2 infection as an underlying aetiological factor. Studies of paediatric specific cohorts are needed to better understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS at presentation and on long-term follow-up in children.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to effectively prioritize patients who are symptomatic for testing to assist early COVID-19 detection in Brazil, addressing problems related to inefficient testing and control strategies. METHODS: Raw data from 55,676 Brazilians were preprocessed, and the chi-square test was used to confirm the relevance of the following features: gender, health professional, fever, sore throat, dyspnea, olfactory disorders, cough, coryza, taste disorders, and headache. Classification models were implemented relying on preprocessed data sets; supervised learning; and the algorithms multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The models' performances were analyzed using 10-fold cross-validation, classification metrics, and the Friedman and Nemenyi statistical tests. The permutation feature importance method was applied for ranking the features used by the classification models with the highest performances. RESULTS: Gender, fever, and dyspnea were among the highest-ranked features used by the classification models. The comparative analysis presents MLP, GBM, DT, RF, XGBoost, and SVM as the highest performance models with similar results. KNN and LR were outperformed by the other algorithms. Applying the easy interpretability as an additional comparison criterion, the DT was considered the most suitable model. CONCLUSIONS: The DT classification model can effectively (with a mean accuracy&#8805;89.12%) assist COVID-19 test prioritization in Brazil. The model can be applied to recommend the prioritizing of a patient who is symptomatic for COVID-19 testing.","Viana Dos Santos Santana, Íris; Cm da Silveira, Andressa; Sobrinho, Álvaro; Chaves E Silva, Lenardo; Dias da Silva, Leandro; Santos, Danilo F S; Gurjão, Edmar C; Perkusich, Angelo",J Med Internet Res,,388

292589,COVID-19 in Malawi: lessons in pandemic preparedness from a tertiary children's hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a massive increase in the number of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). This created significant organizational challenges including numerous non-specialist ICU caregivers who came to work in the ICU. In this context, pragmatic protocols were essential to simplify nutritional care. We aimed at providing a simple and easy-to-prescribe nutritional protocol and evaluated its usefulness with questionnaires sent to physicians involved in the care of ICU COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A simplified nutrition protocol was distributed to all physicians (n = 122) of the ICU medical team during COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical dieticians estimated energy targets for acute and post-acute phases at patient's admission and suggested adaptations of nutrition therapy. More complex situations were discussed with clinical nutrition doctors and, if required, a clinical evaluation was performed. To further facilitate the procedure, a chart with prescription aids was also distributed to the whole medical ICU team. At the end of the current pandemic wave, a 13-item questionnaire was emailed to the ICU medical team to obtain their opinion on the suggested nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Answers were received from 81/122 medical doctors (MDs) (66% response rate), from intensive care physicians (41%), anaesthesiologists (53%) and MDs from other specialties (6%). Thirty-two percent of MDs felt that their knowledge of nutrition management was insufficient and 45% of the physicians surveyed did not face nutrition management in their daily practice prior to the pandemic. The initially proposed nutritional protocol, the chart with prescription aids and the suggested nutritional proposals were considered as useful to very useful by the majority of physicians surveyed (89.9, 90.7 and 92.1% respectively). The protocol was followed by 92% of MDs, and almost all participants (95%) were convinced that adaptations of nutritional therapy had beneficial effects on patients' outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients is a challenge and the implementation of this specific pandemic simplified nutritional protocol was assessed as useful by a great majority of physicians. Pragmatic and simplified protocols are useful for ensuring the quality of nutritional therapy and could be used in future studies to assess its actual impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","de Watteville, Aude; Genton, Laurence; Barcelos, Gleicy Keli; Pugin, Jérôme; Pichard, Claude; Heidegger, Claudia Paula",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,388

The consortium included physicians and coordinators from the 4 ECMO centers in San Diego County. Guidelines were created to ensure that ECMO was delivered equitably and in a resource effective manner across the county during the pandemic. A biomedical ethicist reviewed the guidelines to ensure ECMO use would provide maximal community benefit of this limited resource. The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency further incorporated the guidelines into its plans for the allocation of scarce resources. The consortium held weekly video conferences to review countywide ECMO capacity (including census and staffing), share data, and discuss clinical practices and difficult cases. Equipment exchanges between ECMO centers maximized regional capacity. From March 1 to November 30, 2020, consortium participants placed 97 patients on ECMO. No eligible patients were denied ECMO due to lack of resources or capacity. The Southern California ECMO Consortium may serve as a model for other communities seeking to optimize ECMO resources during the current COVID-19 or future pandemics.","Odish, Mazen; Yi, Cassia; Eigner, Juliann; Kenner Brininger, Amelia; Koenig, Kristi L; Willms, David; Lerum, Suzan; McCaul, Scott; Boyd King, Ayana; Sutherland, George; Cederquist, Lynette; Owens, Robert L; Pollema, Travis",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,388

Myocarditis is an uncommon pathologic diagnosis occurring in 4.5% of highly selected cases undergoing autopsy or endomyocardial biopsy. Although polymerase chain reaction-detectable virus could be found in the lungs of most coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-infected subjects in our own autopsy registry, in only 2 cases was the virus detected in the heart. It should be appreciated that myocardial inflammation alone by macrophages and T cells can be seen in noninfectious deaths and COVID-19 cases, but the extent of each is different, and in neither case do such findings represent clinically relevant myocarditis. Given its extremely low frequency and unclear therapeutic implications, the authors do not advocate use of endomyocardial biopsy to diagnose myocarditis in the setting of COVID-19.","Kawakami, Rika; Sakamoto, Atsushi; Kawai, Kenji; Gianatti, Andrea; Pellegrini, Dario; Nasr, Ahmed; Kutys, Bob; Guo, Liang; Cornelissen, Anne; Mori, Masayuki; Sato, Yu; Pescetelli, Irene; Brivio, Matteo; Romero, Maria; Guagliumi, Giulio; Virmani, Renu; Finn, Aloke V",J Am Coll Cardiol,,388

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4-45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108). When tested between 25 and 42 h after delivery, 4/29 (13.7 %) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise. There were no other differences in maternal, obstetrical or neonatal outcomes.","Hcini, Najeh; Maamri, Fatma; Picone, Olivier; Carod, Jean-Francois; Lambert, Véronique; Mathieu, Meredith; Carles, Gabriel; Pomar, Léo",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,388
298257,Palliative care: Experts call for major reforms as pandemic accelerates demand by 20 years,2021,"Objective: Caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care professionals (HCPs), increasing their risk of moral injury (MI) and clinician burnout. The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed via an online survey conducted from March 27, 2020 to April 26, 2020. The 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional version (MISS-HP) was administered along with measures of clinician mental health and burnout. A total of 3,006 physicians and nurses who completed the questionnaire were included in the final analysis. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the associations, including that between COVID-19 patient exposure and the risk of moral injury. Results: MISS-HP scores strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms. The estimated prevalence of MI in the total sample was 41.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [39.3%, 43.0%]. HCPs providing medical care to COVID-19 patients experienced a 28% greater risk of MI than those providing medical care to patients without the coronavirus (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56], p = .01). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HCPs in mainland China are at risk for significant MI symptoms as well as mental health problems and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. MI symptoms are strongly correlated with higher clinician burnout, greater psychological distress, and lower level of subjective well-being. Effective strategies are needed to address MI and other mental health problems in frontline health care workers treating those with and without COVID-19 disease.

302228,The current second wave and COVID-19 vaccination status in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical approaches have been for decades used to probe the structure of DNA sequences. This has led to the development of Bioinformatics. In this exploratory work, a novel mathematical method is applied to probe the DNA structure of two related viral families: those of coronaviruses and those of influenza viruses. The coronaviruses are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The influenza viruses include H1N1-1918, H1N1-2009, H2N2-1957, and H3N2-1968. METHODS: The mathematical method used is the slow feature analysis (SFA), a rather new but promising method to delineate complex structure in DNA sequences. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that the DNA sequences exhibit an elaborate and convoluted structure akin to complex networks. We define a measure of complexity and show that each DNA sequence exhibits a certain degree of complexity within itself, while at the same time there exists complex inter-relationships between the sequences within a family and between the two families. From these relationships, we find evidence, especially for the coronavirus family, that increasing complexity in a sequence is associated with higher transmission rate but with lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity measure defined here may hold a promise and could become a useful tool in the prediction of transmission and mortality rates in future new viral strains.","Tsonis, Anastasios A; Wang, Geli; Zhang, Lvyi; Lu, Wenxu; Kayafas, Aristotle; Del Rio-Tsonis, Katia",Hum Genomics,,388

However, inconsistency in the nomenclature limits uniformity in its epidemiological understanding. This study provides an integration of existing classifications and describes evolutionary trends of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India. Methods: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States/Union Territories (January to September 2020) from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Pangolin) lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. Results: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020, the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR/GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades, respectively, were noted to be indigenous evolutions. Sites identified to be under positive selection pressure within these clades were found to occur majorly in the non-structural proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b. Interpretation & conclusions: This study interpreted the geographical and temporal dominance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in India over a period of nine months based on the GISAID classification. An integration of the GISAID, Nextstrain and Pangolin classifications is also provided. The emergence of new lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 was indicative of host-specific evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in India. The hotspot mutations such as those driven by positive selection need to be further characterized.","Potdar, Varsha; Vipat, Veena; Ramdasi, Ashwini; Jadhav, Santosh; Pawar-Patil, Jayashri; Walimbe, Atul; Patil, Sucheta S; Choudhury, Manohar L; Shastri, Jayanthi; Agrawal, Sachee; Pawar, Shailesh; Lole, Kavita; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah",Indian J Med Res,,388

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all COVID-19 patients with increased levels of hs-troponin I from two hospitals in Wuhan, China. Demographic information, laboratory test results, cardiac ultrasonographic findings, and electrocardiograms were collected, and their predictive value on in-hospital mortality was explored using multivariable logistic regression. Of 1500 patients screened, 242 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. Their median age was 68 years, and (48.8%) had underlying cardiovascular diseases. One hundred and seventy-six (72.7%) patients died during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression showed that C-reactive protein (>75.5 mg/L), D-dimer (>1.5 µg/mL), and acute respiratory distress syndrome were risk factors of mortality, and the peak hs-troponin I levels (>259.4 pg/mL) instead of the hs-troponin I levels at admission was predictor of death. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the peak levels of hs-troponin I for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.86; sensitivity, 0.80; specificity, 0.72; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the risk of in-hospital death among COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury can be predicted by the peak levels of hs-troponin I during hospitalization and was significantly associated with oxygen supply-demand mismatch, inflammation, and coagulation.","Wang, Yaxin; Shu, Huaqing; Liu, Hong; Li, Xia; Zhou, Xing; Zou, Xiaojing; Pan, Shangwen; Xu, Jiqian; Xu, Dan; Zhao, Xin; Yang, Xiaobo; Yu, Yuan; Yuan, Yin; Qi, Hong; Wang, Qiongya; Shang, You",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,,388

AIMS: To compare the risk of severe COVID-19 according to IBD medications in a large and unselected population. METHODS: Using the French national health data system, the risks of hospitalisation and of death or mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 from 15 February 2020 to 31 August 2020 in IBD patients were compared according to IBD treatment (immunomodulators and biologics), using multivariable Cox models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, budesonide/corticosteroids and aminosalicylates use, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 268 185 IBD patients, 600 were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 111 of them died or were mechanically ventilated (including 78 deaths). In multivariable analysis, the risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 did not differ according to IBD treatment category, with adjusted Hazard Ratios (aHR, unexposed patients used as reference) of 0.94 (95%CI: 0.66-1.35) for immunomodulator monotherapy, 1.05 (0.80-1.38) for anti-TNF monotherapy, 0.80 (0.38-1.69) for anti-TNF combination therapy, 1.06 (0.55-2.05) for vedolizumab and 1.25 (0.64-2.43) for ustekinumab. Similarly, the risk of death or mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 did not differ according to IBD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulators and biologics prescribed in patients with IBD do not appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Meyer, Antoine; Semenzato, Laura; Zureik, Mahmoud; Weill, Alain; Carbonnel, Franck; Dray-Spira, Rosemary",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,,388
308040,Personal protective equipment for ENT activity during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"It is well established fact that peptides from various foods offer human health benefits displaying diverse functionalities. Millets considered as super foods is a major alternative in recent days for traditional diet being rich in proteins and fibre along with trace minerals and vitamins. In this connection, proteins from Buckwheat and Quinoa were digested by in vitro simulation digestion for the generation of peptides, analyzed by nLC-MS/MS and the functional annotations of the identified proteins/peptides were carried out. The study led to the identification of 34 small peptides and their parent proteins clustered into 4 gene functional groups and their localization prediction indicated their involvement in energy metabolism, transport and storage. Interestingly, the identified peptides maximally displayed DPP-IV and ACE inhibitions. The present study was extended to unravel ACE-2 inhibition targeting COVID-19 by selecting ACE-2-Spike binding domain for molecular docking studies. The NWRTVKYG interacted with the ACE-2-Spike interface displaying the feasible binding energy (- 213.63) and docking score (- 12.43) and the MD simulation revealed the ability of the peptide in stabilizing the protein-peptide composite. The present investigation thus establishes newer vista for food derived peptides having ACE-2 inhibitory potential as tentative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Rangaswamy, Ashok Nanjaiah; Ashok, Arpitha; Hanumanthappa, Pradeep; Chandrashekaramurthy, Aparanji Sinduvalli; Kumbaiah, Monika; Hiregouda, Pratibha; Sharma, Vaishali; Sosalegowda, Aparna Huligerepura",Int J Pept Res Ther,,388

METHODS: This retrospective study from a University tertiary care hospital in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 25 February 2020 and 25 March 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 317 individuals were enrolled. Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317). The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%). Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%). An 'atypical' presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%). Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury. During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275). On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p < 0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission. Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.","Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Di Biagio, Antonio; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Taramasso, Lucia; De Maria, Andrea; Ball, Lorenzo; Brunetti, Iole; Loconte, Maurizio; Patroniti, Nicolò A; Robba, Chiara; Delfino, Emanuele; Dentone, Chiara; Magnasco, Laura; Nicolini, Laura; Toscanini, Federica; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Barisione, Emanuela; Giacomini, Mauro; Mora, Sara; Baldi, Federico; Balletto, Elisa; Berruti, Marco; Briano, Federica; Sepulcri, Chiara; Dettori, Silvia; Labate, Laura; Mirabella, Michele; Portunato, Federica; Pincino, Rachele; Russo, Chiara; Tutino, Stefania; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",Clin. microbiol. infect,,388

Through functional enrichment analysis, the present study aims to evaluate the biological processes involving host proteins interfered by SARS-CoV-2 to verify the potential metabolic impact of the infection. Furthermore, tissue enrichment analyses and differential gene expression of host proteins were applied to understand the interference by SARS-CoV-2 on tissue levels. Results based on functional and tissue-specific enrichment analyses, presented in this study, suggest that SARS-CoV-2, mediated interference on host proteins, can affect the metabolism and catabolism of molecular building blocks and control intracellular mechanisms, including gene expression in metabolism-related organs, to support viral demands. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can broadly affect the host metabolism and catabolism at tissue and physiological levels contributing to a more severe disease.","Lopes, Luciano Rodrigo",Braz J Microbiol,,388

311736,On the Value of COVID-19 Testing for Children Beyond the Spring of 2021,2021,"In early 2020, the first US and Canadian cases of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were detected. In the ensuing months, there has been rapid spread of the infection. In March 2020, in response to the virus, state/provincial and local governments instituted shelter-in-place orders, and nonessential ambulatory care was significantly curtailed, including allergy/immunology services. With rates of new infections and fatalities potentially reaching a plateau and/or declining, restrictions on provision of routine ambulatory care are lifting, and there is a need to help guide the allergy/immunology clinician on how to reinitiate services. Given the fact that coronavirus disease 2019 will circulate within our communities for months or longer, we present a flexible, algorithmic best-practices planning approach on how to prioritize services, in 4 stratified phases of reopening according to community risk level, as well as highlight key considerations for how to safely do so. The decisions on what services to offer and how fast to proceed are left to the discretion of the individual clinician and practice, operating in accordance with state and local ordinances with respect to the level of nonessential ambulatory care that can be provided. Clear communication with staff and patients before and after all changes should be incorporated into this new paradigm on continual change, given the movement may be forward and even backward through the phases because this is an evolving situation.","Searing, Daniel A; Dutmer, Cullen M; Fleischer, David M; Shaker, Marcus S; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell H; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W Y; Rider, Nicholas L; Vander Leek, Timothy K; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K; Abrams, Elissa M; Bansal, Priya; Lang, David M; Lieberman, Jay; Golden, David Bk; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J.

312775,Emerging from the Epicenter: Reflections on the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"A recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has driven a global pandemic with catastrophic consequences. The rapid development of promising therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 is keenly anticipated. Family Coronaviridae comprises positive, single-stranded RNA viruses that use RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for viral replication and transcription. As the RdRP of viruses in this family and others plays a pivotal role in infection, it is a promising therapeutic target for developing antiviral agents against them. A critical genetic driver for many cancers is the catalytic subunit of telomerase: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), identified initially as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. However, even though hTERT is a DNA polymerase, it has phylogenetic and structural similarities to viral RdRPs. Researchers worldwide, including the authors of this review, are engaged in developing therapeutic strategies targeting hTERT. We have published a series of papers reporting that hTERT has RdRP activity and that this RdRP activity in hTERT is essential for tumor formation. Here, we review the enzymatic function of RdRP in virus proliferation and tumor development, reminding us of how the study of the novel coronavirus has brought us to the unexpected intersection of cancer research and RNA virus research.","Machitani, Mitsuhiro; Yasukawa, Mami; Nakashima, Jotaro; Furuichi, Yasuhiro; Masutomi, Kenkichi",Cancer sci,,388

We included all consecutive patients referred for an ACS who underwent PCI from February 17, 2020 to April 26, 2020 in a high-volume PCI coronary care unit. We compared the number of ACS patients in 2020 to the same period in 2018 and 2019. Predictors of adverse outcome in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients were recorded: symptom-onset-to-first medical contact (FMC), and FMC-to-sheath insertion times. During the studied period (calendar weeks 8-17, 2018-2020), 144 ACS patients were included. In 2020, we observed two distinct phases in the ACS admissions: a first significant fall, with a relative reduction of 73%, from the week of lockdown (week 12) to 3 weeks later and then an increase of ACS. Median symptom-onset-to-FMC time was significantly higher in 2020 than in the two previous years (600 min [298-632] versus 121 min [55-291], p < 0.001). Median FMC-to-sheath insertion did not differ significantly (93 min [81-131] in 2020 versus 90 min [67-137] in 2018-2019, p = 0.57). The main findings are (1) a pattern of a U-curve in ACS admissions, with a first decrease in ACS admissions and a return to ""normality"" 4 weeks after; (2) a significant increase in the total ischemic time exclusively due to an increase in the symptom-onset-to-first-medical-contact time.","Hauguel-Moreau, Marie; Pillière, Rémy; Prati, Giulio; Beaune, Sébastien; Loeb, Thomas; Lannou, Simon; Mallet, Sophie; Mustafic, Hazrije; Bégué, Céline; Dubourg, Olivier; Mansencal, Nicolas",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,388

This study investigates effects in a hospital model under different rollout schemes. Methods. A simulation model is implemented in VBA, and is studied for parameter variation in a predefined hospital setting. The implemented code is available as open access supplement. Main results. A rollout scheme assigning vaccine doses to staff primarily by staff’s pathogen exposure maximizes the predicted open hospital capacity when compared to a rollout based on a purely hierarchical prioritization. The effect increases under resource scarcity and greater disease activity. Nursing staff benefits most from an exposure focused rollout. Conclusions. The model employs SARS-CoV-2 parameters;nonetheless, effects observable in the model are transferable to other infectious diseases.

327453,Interim Analysis of Attrition Rates in Palliative Care Study on Dignity Therapy,2021,"This paper presents some concepts and reflections on the prospects of SME productive systems that try to cope with the crisis provoked by the Covid-19, to reposition for the post-emergency, and to increase the readiness towards impending digital and green challenges. It focuses on the impacts of the emergency on a frame of opportunities and threats for such systems in Italy. An effective and progressive governance would be needed to overthrow barriers to change and reduce systemic uncertainties that hinder productive investments. The governance contemplates the collaboration among various types of societal and business actors open to progressive local path transformations within multi-scalar networks. An effective governance requires a supportive national strategic planning as well. The recovery and resilience plan of the Italian government within Next Generation EU should consider such support to increase the possibility of successful digital and green transformation in SMEs productive systems within new paths of territorial development.","Bellandi, Marco",Symphonya,,388

329051,What Should We Be Studying Regarding COVID-19?,2020,"How does a public health crisis like a global pandemic affect political opinions in fragile democratic contexts? Research in political science suggests several possible public reactions to crisis, from retrospective anti-incumbency to rally 'round the flag effects to democratic erosion and authoritarianism. Which of these obtains depends on the nature of the crisis. We examine whether and how the onset of the global pandemic shifted public opinion toward the president, elections, and democracy in Haiti. We embedded two experiments in a phone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of Haitians in April-June 2020. We find that the early pandemic boosted presidential approval and intentions to vote for the incumbent president, consistent with a rally effect. These results show that a rally effect occurs even in the most unlikely of places-an unstable context in which the incumbent president is struggling to maintain order and support. At the same time, we find scant evidence that the onset of the pandemic eroded democratic attitudes, even in a context in which democracy rests on uncertain grounds.","Lupu, Noam; Zechmeister, Elizabeth J",PLoS One,,388
329113,Mobility and Mortality During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: We conducted the present study to investigate the nutritional status of critically ill COVID-19 patients and validate the GLIM criteria with respect to the SGA. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 109 ICU patients were assessed for malnutrition based on GLIM and SGA criteria. The relation between nutrition assessment tools and duration of hospitalization and mortality were also evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of GLIM criteria concerning the detection of malnutrition was assessed based on the area under the curve. RESULTS: Malnutrition, according to the SGA and GLIM criteria, was found in 68 (62.4%) and 66 (61.5%) of our subjects. There was an optimal agreement between the GLIM criteria and the SGA criteria regarding malnutrition diagnosis (K = 0.85, P < 0.001). The area under curve for the GLIM was stratified based on the SGA results and was 0.927 (95% CI: 0.868-0.985) with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 93%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is frequently observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients. GLIM criteria is a valid tool and has a strong association with mortality and longer duration of ICU stay.","Shahbazi, Shaahin; Hajimohammadebrahim-Ketabforoush, Melika; Vahdat Shariatpanahi, Maryam; Shahbazi, Erfan; Vahdat Shariatpanahi, Zahra",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,388

330254,Initiation of a pharmacist driven process to ensure long-acting and high-dose opioid prescription continuity during a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STECs) are foodborne pathogens associated with bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although the STEC O157 serogroup accounts for the highest number of infections, HUS-related complications and deaths, the STEC non-O157, as a group, accounts for a larger proportion of STEC infections and lower HUS cases. There is limited information available on how to recognize non-O157 serotypes associated with severe disease. The objectives of this study were to describe a patient with STEC non-O157 infection complicated with HUS and to conduct a comparative whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis among the patient's STEC clinical isolate and STEC O157 and non-O157 strains. RESULTS: The STEC O145:H25 strain EN1I-0044-2 was isolated from a pediatric patient with diarrhea, HUS and severe neurologic and cardiorespiratory complications, who was enrolled in a previously reported case-control study of acute gastroenteritis conducted in Davidson County, Tennessee in 2013. The strain EN1I-0044-2 genome sequence contained a chromosome and three plasmids. Two of the plasmids were similar to those present in O145:H25 strains whereas the third unique plasmid EN1I-0044-2_03 shared no similarity with other STEC plasmids, and it carried 23 genes of unknown function. Strain EN1I-0044-2, compared with O145:H25 and O157 serogroup strains shared chromosome- and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, including Shiga toxin, LEE type III secretion system, LEE effectors, SFP fimbriae, and additional toxins and colonization factors. CONCLUSIONS: A STEC O145:H25 strain EN1I-0044-2 was isolated from a pediatric patient with severe disease, including HUS, in Davidson County, TN. Phylogenetic and comparison WGS analysis provided evidence that strain EN1I-0044-2 closely resembles O145:H25, and confirmed an independent evolutionary path of STEC O145:H25 and O145:H28 serotypes. The strain EN1I-0044-2 virulence make up was similar to other O145:H25 and O157 serogroups. It carried stx2 and the LEE pathogenicity island, and additional colonization factors and enterotoxin genes. A unique feature of strain EN1I-0044-2 was the presence of plasmid pEN1I-0044-2_03 carrying genes with functions to be determined. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the role that newly acquired genes by O145:H25 strains play in pathogenesis, and to determine if they may serve as genetic markers of severe disease.","Guerra, Julio A; Zhang, Chengxian; Bard, Jonathan E; Yergeau, Donald; Halasa, Natasha; Gómez-Duarte, Oscar G",BMC Genomics,,388

We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities.

335111,Olfactory function and viral recovery in COVID-19,2021,"The newly identified SARS CoV2 has become a global pandemic since December 2019. Various researchers are trying to design a vaccine candidate against the virus. On the other hand, another group is focussing on repurposing approved or clinically tested drugs for treatment. However, there is always a search for alternative therapies. Thus, we propose an alternative approach apart from chemotherapy that is the usage of miRNA as novel antisense therapy to cure SARS CoV2 infected patients. To address the objective, miRNAs have been designed by targeting the genome of SARS CoV2 (Indian isolate). First, the open reading frames in the viral genome have been identified, and the proteins encoded by those open reading frames have been predicted. Using computational biology, several miRNAs have been designed and their probability to bind to a viral gene has been predicted. In addition, miRNA target mining in the host cell has been done to rule out the possibility of non-specific binding of the miRNAs. The miRNAs having the highest chances to bind to the viral genome have been converted into pre-miRNAs, and their interaction with dicer endoribonuclease has been studied by molecular docking. Results revealed that the pre-miRNAs interact with the RNAse III 2 domain of dicer. Thus, it is predicted that the pre-miRNAs after delivery to the infected host cell will be processed by dicer to generate mature miRNAs that will target the SARS CoV2 viral genome. Therefore, miRNA therapy can be an alternative approach for the treatment of SARS CoV2 infection.","Devi, Arpita; Chaitanya, Nyshadham S N",IUBMB life,,388

The model is based on the Verhulst equation, which has been used to fit the data of the COVID-19 spread in China, Italy, and Spain. This model has been used to predict both the infection peak day, and the total infected people in Italy and Spain. With this prediction model, the overall infections, the infection peak, and date can accurately be predicted one week before they occur. According to the study, the infection peak took place on 23 March in Italy, and on 29 March in Spain. Moreover, the influence of the total and partial lockdowns has been studied, without finding any meaningful difference in the disease spread. However, the infected population, and the rate of new infections at the start of the lockdown, seem to play an important role in the infection spread. The developed model is not only an important tool to predict the disease spread, but also gives some significant clues about the main factors that affect to the COVID-19 spread, and quantifies the effects of partial and total lockdowns as well.","Sanchez-Caballero, Samuel; Selles, Miguel A; Peydro, Miguel A; Perez-Bernabeu, Elena",,,388

METHODS: A cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, from January 2020 to February 2020, was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was performed to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with COX proportional hazard regression model. The primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), respectively. RESULTS: Total 320 adult patients were enrolled in our analyses. Patients were divided into low IL-6/LY group and high IL-6/LY group based on the cutoff value with 2.50. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high-value group (IL-6/LY &#8805; 2.50) had a greater risk of poor prognosis (P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that IL-6/LY was the independent risk predictor for in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 3.404; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.090-10.633, P = 0.035) and MODS development (HR, 4.143; 95%CI, 1.321-12.986, P = 0.015). Meanwhile, IL-6/LY was positively correlated with the MuLBSTA score (r = 0.137, P = 0.031), suggesting that IL-6/LY was associated with long-term mortality (90-day). Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that the dynamic changes of inflammatory immune indexes were related to the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated IL-6/LY was related with the increased risk of poor prognosis. Not only that, IL-6/LY could be used for risk stratification and early clinical identification of high-risk patients.","Yang, Boyi; Chang, Xiaoyan; Huang, Jiabao; Pan, Wen; Si, Zhilong; Zhang, Cuntai; Li, Hong",Int Immunopharmacol,,388
338515,"Brief report A public-Private partnership model to build a triage system in response to a COVID-19 outbreak in Hanam City, South Korea",2020,"Background and Objectives: Action, not fear, is the path forward in the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since early 2020, the world's nations have faced conundrums over severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections resulting in COVID-19 resulting in national closures, and thus, a clear understandable plan that nations can implement is required to reopen. The healthcare benefits of reopening a nation more likely than not exceed the benefits of continued pandemic-related closure. Pandemic-related closures have resulted in countless delayed or avoided urgent care evaluations. Furthermore, routine care of acute and chronic illnesses, including evaluations, diagnoses, and treatments, has also been delayed. Isolation, loss of income, and fear have resulted in mental health conditions or exacerbated existing conditions. The magnitude of untoward ramifications is unknown and may ultimately represent an inestimable degree of danger and morbidity, and even death. The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has created an atmosphere of fear of COVID-19 that has directly and indirectly injured the world's population. Since this has resulted in increasing morbidity and mortality, creating economic chaos, and near systemic collapse of educational systems with no well described plan forward, it is the purpose of this study to provide guidelines that provide a path forward to safely open a nation. Physicians often equipped by their education, training, and experiences across disciplines are uniquely positioned to comprehend, coordinate, and teach other physicians, business owners, and municipal and government leaders from guidelines. As such, physicians may take the lead in a path forward to reopening a nation, including opening businesses, educational facilities, and religious establishments, while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Reviews of the literature among the disciplines of environmental air, sanitation, social interaction, medical testing, vaccination, protection, and disease prevention and safety allowed for the conceptualization and eventual genesis of identifiable interventions which either reduce the viral load in the environment or inactivate the virus from replication. Each of the guidelines was selected based on the principle that it involved the elimination or inactivation of the viral particle. With a reduction in viral load or inactivation of replication, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to allow for reopening a nation with an increased level of safety. Results: The guidelines identified, including air exchange (ventilation), air filtration, personal protective filtering devices (masks), hand hygiene, social distancing, screening and testing, vaccines, high-risk patient protection, medical management, and adjunctive therapies, are described and referenced. Conclusions: In that the pandemic is primarily a public health issue, the path forward is best coordinated by local, regional, and national physicians. Many physicians with a breadth of experiences are uniquely positioned to coordinate the implementation of these interdisciplinary guidelines. Using these guidelines as a planned, coordinated action, not fear, is a path forward.

SETTING: Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Ten patients attending ophthalmic outpatient clinic (OPD) and operating room (OR) were included. Using Schlieren imaging, exhaled airflow patterns were documented with/without an N95 mask or face shield during respiratory activities. Recordings were performed with and without room air conditioning turned on. Exhaled airflow patterns in OPD and OR when using vs not using these infection control measures and the impact of room air circulation on these were compared. RESULTS: Five patients each in OPD and OR were included. There was a forward stream of exhaled air from the patient's mouth/nose during all respiratory activities. An N95 mask dampened its intensity and forward transmission. Taping the mask around the nasal bridge further reduced airflow leakage. A mechanical barrier in front of the patient's face blocked forward propagation of the exhaled airflow. Turning on a forceful and direct draft of air over the surgeon's working area dampened and diverted the exhaled airflow away from the surgeons' breathing area. This effect was particularly pronounced in the OR, with the overhead laminar airflow.

344215,Stress and Symptom Burden in Oncology Patients during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are key to create sustainable higher education institutions (HEIs). Most researchers focused on the students’ perspective, especially during the online teaching caused by COVID-19;however, university teachers are often forgotten, having their opinion missing. This study’s objective was to determine the factors that contribute to the inclusion of ICTs. The research based on a comparative study through an online qualitative survey focused on the inclusion and use of ICTs in two HEIs and two different moments (pre- and post-lockdowns). There were differences regarding country and working experience (p &lt;0.001), being linked to the ICTs use, evaluation of obstacles, and the role given to ICTs (p &lt;0.05). The COVID-19 caused modifications of the teachers’ perspectives, including an improvement of the opinion of older teachers regarding the essentialness of ICTs in the teaching process (p &lt;0.001) and worsening their perception about their ICTs skill (p &lt;0.05). Additionally, an initial model focused only on the university teachers and their use of ICTs has been proposed. In conclusion, the less experienced university teachers used more ICTs, identified more greatly the problematic factors, and considered more important the ICTs, with the perception of all teachers modified by COVID-19.","Navarro-Espinosa, Johanna Andrea Vaquero-Abellán Manuel Perea-Moreno Alberto-Jesús Pedrós-Pérez Gerardo Aparicio-Martínez Pilar Martínez-Jiménez Mª Pilar",Sustainability,,388
345087,Outbreak of anorexia nervosa admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate the safety of face masks worn by patients during intravitreal injections. METHODS: A prospective, qualitative, interventional study performed in a tertiary university hospital. Healthy volunteers were asked to wear three different professional surgical face masks while air leaks around the eyes were monitored. Three types of masks were investigated as follows: 1) surgical face mask with four tying strips, 2) surgical face mask with elastic ear loops and 3) 2200 N95 tuberculosis particulate face mask. For each session the periocular area was inspected for air leak during normal respiration, speech, and deep respiration. Detection of air leak was performed using the following two professional thermal cameras: FLIR A310-thermal camera and EyeCGas 2.0-super sensitive infrared camera used for detection of minute fugitive emissions of industrial gases. RESULTS: Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The experiment was repeated 45 times for each camera; 3 times for each of 3 mask types, on 5 volunteers, for a total of 90 trials. Air jets were detected originating from the superior edges of the masks radiating toward the eyes in 81% (73/90) of cases in total; 71% (32/45) with the FLIR camera and 91% (41/45) with the OPGAL camera. Air leaks were detected with all investigated mask types. CONCLUSION: Patients wearing face masks during intravitreal injections may be at a higher risk of endophthalmitis. Until further data are available, we recommend verifying proper face mask fitting and either taping the upper edges of the face masks with a medical adhesive tape or using an adhesive surgical drape around the injected eye.","Hadayer, Amir; Zahavi, Alon; Livny, Eitan; Gal-Or, Orly; Gershoni, Assaf; Mimouni, Karin; Ehrlich, Rita",Retina,,388

This is aimed at sensitizing the population of annihilating optically dark triplets that generates the high energy photoluminescence. A large resonance between the involved triplets is usually recommended because it increases the energy gain between absorbed and emitted upconverted photons. However, it also enables efficient back-ET from acceptor to donor triplets, with potential detrimental consequences on the system performance. Here, we analyze a model system, where the energy difference between donor and acceptor triplets is lower than kBT at room temperature by means of time resolved and steady state photoluminescence spectroscopy, and develop a kinetic model, which describes the iterative loop that transfers the triplet exciton between the donor and acceptor molecules. In such a way, we obtained the guidelines for the optimization of the system composition required to overcome the back-ET effect and maximize the upconversion quantum yield.","Meroni, Diletta; Monguzzi, Angelo; Meinardi, Francesco",J Chem Phys,,388
347718,A Computational Modeling Study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has greatly impacted healthcare systems and society more generally around the world. The management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has primarily impacted emergency departments, medical teams, and intensive care units. However, the impact on health systems as a whole, including surgical specialties, has been wide ranging. We aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on the number and characteristics of general surgical patients reviewed and/or admitted by the surgical team within a district general hospital. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted in the 2-week period from start of the lockdown (Monday 23rd March 2020 to 5th April 2020), and the same period 1 year earlier (Monday 25th March 2019 to 7th April 2019). Number of patients reviewed and admitted were compared between the two cohorts. Data including diagnosis, operation/procedural interventions, and length of stay were analysed. The overall number of patients reviewed and admitted by the surgical team was substantially lower during the period of lockdown (61 vs 126). Of the patients seen during lockdown, a smaller proportion were admitted to hospital after initial surgical review (59% vs 77%, p < 0.05). Interventional/operative procedures were performed in a similar proportion of patients in both cohorts (31%). Our data show that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of patients being referred to and admitted by the general surgical team at our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. Explanations for this include reduced attendance due to risk perception of the patients, the impact of lockdown messages and advice regarding self-isolation, as well as an increased threshold for patient admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key learning points include the possible benefits of a reduction in admission to hospital of patients with nonurgent conditions.","Callan, Rory; Assaf, Nazrin; Bevan, Katharine",Surg Res Pract,,388

Commonly, Apocalyptic anxiety motivates further evasion and further turning away, leading to further destructiveness, setting a vicious circle in motion. How can this vicious circle be interrupted, or at least slowed down? If there is hope to be found, it is to be sought in a form of dwelling with others that I call emotional dwelling (Stolorow & Atwood, 2018)-an active, engaged, participatory comportment that I have recommended for the therapeutic approach to emotional trauma. In dwelling, one leans into the other's emotional pain and participates in it. The language that one uses to address another's experience of trauma meets the trauma head-on, articulating the unbearable and the unendurable, saying the unsayable, unmitigated by any efforts to soothe, comfort, encourage, or reassure-such efforts invariably being experienced by the other as a turning away from the experience of trauma. In order to tackle the overwhelming and multiple perils of a devastating pandemic and of climate change, we must include in our dwelling on earth an emotional dwelling with one another that renders shared Apocalyptic anxiety more tolerable, thereby diminishing the need to turn away.

349777,"Report from the 2. International LAST AID Conference Online-The social impact of palliative care, October 30 2020, Maribor, Slovenia",2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led to a halt in elective surgeries throughout the United States and many other countries throughout the world. Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the postoperative period.","Vranis, Neil M; Bekisz, Jonathan M; Daar, David A; Chiu, Ernest S; Wilson, Stelios C",J Surg Res,,388
351567,International COVID-19 Palliative Care Guidance for Nursing Homes Leaves Key Themes Unaddressed,2020,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms are reported to have worse prognosis. Ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the gene encoding the host protein to which SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind, is expressed in the gut and therefore may be a target for preventing or reducing severity of COVID-19. Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases. Together, these data suggest that the microbiome may be one modifiable factor determining COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity.","Koester, Sean T; Li, Naisi; Lachance, Daniel M; Morella, Norma M; Dey, Neelendu",PLoS One,,388

355522,"Comparative Analysis of Pediatric COVID-19 Infection in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Japan, and China",2021,"Predictive modeling often uses black box machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs [2] enable important features to be discovered with control of the false discovery rate (fdr). However, knockoffs require rich generative models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they obey the so-called ""swap"" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs (ddlk), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap property. ddlk consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, ddlk uses the Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case swap. We find ddlk has higher power than baselines while controlling the false discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.","Sudarshan, M.; Tansey, W.; Ranganath, R.",Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,,388

The analysis also includes the time-varying cross-quantile correlation to observe the evolution of Islamic stocks' safe-haven potential. Our full sample analysis shows that Islamic stocks do not exhibit safe-haven properties for G7 stock markets. During the GFC period, Islamic stocks show some diversification benefits for the G7 stock markets. Notably, Islamic stocks emerged as a robust safe-haven asset for the G7 stock markets during the pandemic crisis.

We used Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands. METHODS: GT was used to explore internet activity related to loss of smell in the 8 aforementioned countries. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss-of-smell-relative search volumes (RSVs), with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS: In all 8 countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID-19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands. We hypothesize this may relate to a previously underrecognized symptom.","Walker, Abigail; Hopkins, Claire; Surda, Pavol",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,,388

The purpose of this study was to clarify this relationship, while accounting for some other factors that likely influence scientific impact (e.g., the reputations of the scientists conducting the research and academic journal in which the research was published). To accomplish this purpose, approximately 800 peer-reviewed articles describing original research were evaluated for scientific impact, popular media attention, and reputations of the scientists/authors and publication venue. A structural equation model was produced describing the relationship between non-scientific impact (popular media) and scientific impact (citations), while accounting for author/scientist and journal reputation. The resulting model revealed a strong association between the amount of popular media attention given to a scientific research project and corresponding publication and the number of times that publication is cited in peer-reviewed scientific literature. These results indicate that (1) peer-reviewed scientific publications receiving more attention in non-scientific media are more likely to be cited than scientific publications receiving less popular media attention, and (2) the non-scientific media is associated with the scientific agenda. These results may inform scientists who increasingly use popular media to inform the general public and scientists concerning their scientific work. These results might also inform administrators of higher education and research funding mechanisms, who base decisions partly on scientific impact.","Anderson, P Sage; Odom, Aubrey R; Gray, Hunter M; Jones, Jordan B; Christensen, William F; Hollingshead, Todd; Hadfield, Joseph G; Evans-Pickett, Alyssa; Frost, Megan; Wilson, Christopher; Davidson, Lance E; Seeley, Matthew K",PLoS One,,388

At present, neonates acount for only a very small portion in the pediatric population affected by COVID-19. Thus, data on epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in neonates are very limited. Approximately 3% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were noted to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Current limited data on neonates with COVID-19 suggest that neonatal COVID-19 shows a relatively benign course despite a high requirement for mechanical ventilation. However, neonates with preiexisting medical conditions and preterm infants appear to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The greatest concern in perinatal aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the possibility of vertical transmission, especially transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although direct evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking, the possibility of vertical transmission during late pregnancy cannot be ruled out. This review summarizes available case studies on COVID-19 in neonates and introduces what is currently known about neonatal COVID-19, focusing on its vertical transmission.","Kim, Do-Hyun",,,388

377667,Why is There Low Morbidity and Mortality of COVID-19 in Africa?,2020,"Importance: The incidence of mother-to-newborn SARS-CoV-2 transmission appears low and may be associated with biological and social factors. However, data are limited on the factors associated with neonatal clinical or viral testing outcomes. Objective: To ascertain the percentage of neonates who were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results during the birth hospitalization, the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with neonatal test result positivity, and the clinical and virological outcomes for newborns during hospitalization and 30 days after discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study included 11 academic or community hospitals in Massachusetts and mother-neonate dyads whose delivery and discharge occurred between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Eligible dyads were identified at each participating hospital through local COVID-19 surveillance and infection control systems. Neonates were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results within 14 days before to 72 hours after delivery, and neonates were followed up for 30 days after birth hospital discharge. Exposures: Hypothesized maternal risk factors in neonatal test result positivity included maternal COVID-19 symptoms, vaginal delivery, rooming-in practice, Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, and zip code-derived social vulnerability index. Delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms was hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse neonatal health outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes for neonates were (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, (2) indicators of adverse health, and (3) clinical signs and viral testing. Test result positivity was defined as at least 1 positive result on a specimen obtained by nasopharyngeal swab using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Clinical and testing data were obtained from electronic medical records of nonroutine health care visits within 30 days after hospital discharge. Results: The cohort included 255 neonates (mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 37.9 [2.6] weeks; 62 [24.3%] with low birth weight or preterm delivery) with 250 mothers (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.3] years; 121 [48.4%] were of Hispanic ethnicity). Of the 255 neonates who were born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 225 (88.2%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 (2.2%) had positive results during the birth hospitalization. High maternal social vulnerability was associated with higher likelihood of neonatal test result positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.53-16.01; P = .008), adjusted for maternal COVID-19 symptoms, delivery mode, and rooming-in practice. Adverse outcomes during hospitalization were associated with preterm delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 151 newborns with follow-up data, 28 had nonroutine clinical visits, 7 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 1 had a positive result. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings emphasize the importance of both biological and social factors in perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were at risk for both direct and indirect adverse health outcomes, supporting efforts of ongoing surveillance of the virus and long-term follow-up.","Angelidou, Asimenia; Sullivan, Katherine; Melvin, Patrice R; Shui, Jessica E; Goldfarb, Ilona Telefus; Bartolome, Ruby; Chaudhary, Neha; Vaidya, Ruben; Culic, Ivana; Singh, Rachana; Yanni, Diana; Patrizi, Silvia; Hudak, Mark L; Parker, Margaret G; Belfort, Mandy B",JAMA Netw Open,,388
378112,Potential influences of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity on COVID-19 severity,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over forty million patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed in-depth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor. Consequently, this study supports the development of blood biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to aid clinical decision-making and subsequently improve prognosis of COVID-19.","Park, Joonho; Kim, Hyeyoon; Kim, So Yeon; Kim, Yeonjae; Lee, Jee-Soo; Dan, Kisoon; Seong, Moon-Woo; Han, Dohyun",Sci Rep,,388

Neoplasia, inflammatory, demyelinating, and stroke are possible etiologies of this disorder. Case report: We report an elderly female who presented with dysarthria. She was dysarthric with a hypernasal voice, no apraxia or aphasia was observed. Tongue movements were slow with limited amplitude. Her soft palate dropped bilaterally; gag reflex was present. Also, she reported swallowing difficulty and choking with her saliva. Bilateral vertical and horizontal gaze were intact to either voluntary or oculocephalic movements. A cranial CT scan was suggestive of artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hypersignal on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images and hyposignal on apparent diffusion coefficient in both thalami. CT angiography scan revealed an AOP originating from the left posterior cerebral artery. The swallowing study with a videofluoroscopic demonstrated oral and pharyngeal phases with severe dysfunction. Conclusion: To the authors' knowledge, there are two cases of individuals with artery of Percheron infarction who developed PBP associated with other clinical syndromes. Still, isolated PBP following infarction of Percheron's artery was not reported. We hypothesized that the PBP may have occurred because of the existence of vascular territory variations in the perforating arteries that arise from the AOP.","Rissardo, Jamir Pitton; Caprara, Ana Fornari",Afr Health Sci,,388

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough; however, myalgia and dyspnea and the transmission routes include direct transmission by cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, or contact transmission with the oral, nasal, or eye mucous membranes. The dental professionals are the main risk group to COVID-19 due to the transmission routes that are directly related to the dental practice. In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services. OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines. In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19. A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.","Costa, Samuel Macedo; Lacerda, Guilherme Toledo de; Villafort, Rayssa Nunes; Silveira, Roger Lanes; Amaral, Marcio Bruno Figueiredo",J Craniofac Surg,,388

The main purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant studies regarding the willingness to work in emergency and disaster situations, describe and classify the most important challenges and solutions, identifying knowledge gaps in the literature which could inform future research. METHODS: In this Systematic Mapping Review required information was searched from PubMed, Scopus, the web of science, Embase databases, and Google scholar search engine in the period 2000-2020. Data were analyzed using a content framework analysis. RESULTS: From 2902 article search results, 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies varied in terms of aim, study design, and detail of reporting. The results showed that nearly three-quarters of studies were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Most of the studies were published in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the most common types of crises reported in the included studies were emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The results show that most of the problems were in the dimension of mental and psychological issues, personnel health concerns, and management relationship with personnel. CONCLUSION: This mapping review illustrated a big picture of health workers' resilience in disaster conditions. This review presents an overview of different kinds of strategies that address the challenges. One of the most important challenges in health workforce retention is poor communication between managers and staff. Being away from family, which leads to mental fatigue, puts staff in moral dilemmas. Attracting adequate health professionals, especially volunteers and regulating the shifts of health personnel in crisis time will largely prevent burnout.","Nafar, Hamideh; Tahmazi Aghdam, Emir; Derakhshani, Naser; Sani039,; ee, Nadia; Sharifian, Sakineh; Goharinezhad, Salime",Hum Resour Health,,388

Recently, the study of children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies has gathered attention. However, little is known on the corresponding adults' representation, adults who in case of disasters are frequently key informants on children's reactions. Examining the influence of earthquake experience, we explored adults' expectations on children's earthquake-related emotions and coping strategies. The participants were 572 Italian university students. Referring to what happens during and after earthquakes, they were asked to list children's (a) expected emotions, and (b) coping strategies for diminishing fear and sadness. We coded (a) number of fear, sadness, and anger terms; (b) presence of 13 coping strategies. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Fear was more frequent than sadness, and more frequent during vs. after earthquakes (and vice versa for sadness). Some coping strategies were reported rarely, while others were more salient (i.e. problem-solving, information-seeking, self-reliance, support-seeking, and accommodation). Earthquake experience had a marginal impact. Our findings enable us to deepen knowledge on the emotional representation of earthquakes. At an applied level, they can help professionals to develop training programs aimed at increasing children's emotional preparedness.","Raccanello, Daniela; Barnaba, Veronica; Rocca, Emmanuela; Vicentini, Giada; Hall, Rob; Burro, Roberto",Psychol Health Med,,388

Even as the first administration of vaccines begins in 2021, the COVID-19 management strategy will continue to be multi-pronged for the foreseeable future with digital contact tracing being a vital component of the response along with the use of preventive measures such as social distancing and the use of face masks. After some months of deployment of digital contact tracing technology, deeper insights into the merits of various approaches and the usability, privacy, and ethical trade-offs involved are emerging. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of digital contact tracing solutions in terms of their methodologies and technologies in the light of the new data emerging about international experiences of deployments of digital contact tracing technology. We also provide a discussion on open challenges such as scalability, privacy, adaptability and highlight promising directions for future work.","Shahroz, Muhammad; Ahmad, Farooq; Younis, Muhammad Shahzad; Ahmad, Nadeem; Boulos, Maged N.

389864,Emergency Medicine Residency Curricular Innovations: Creating a Virtual Emergency Medicine Didactic Conference,2020,"Background: In Turkey, an increase of scabies cases was detected since the last quarter of 2019. During the same period, Turkey was also under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the whole world. This study aimed to determine the current situation of scabies cases in increasing incidence during COVID-19 pandemic days and to create a scientific resource for the measures to be taken. Methods: This descriptive study was carried out in July 2020 and the records of patients diagnosed with scabies in health institutions in Kirklareli Province between Jan 2017-June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Average number of cases before Sep 2019, when cases began to exceed the expected value, was calculated as 31.7 +/- 12.0 and after Sep 2019 it was calculated as 129.8 +/- 53.6 (P<0.001, CI 95%). The number of scabies cases which increased before the pandemic and reached the epidemic level, decreased dramatically in Mar and Apr 2020. This period was also the period in which the measures taken for the COVID-19 pandemic were most strictly applied. In May and June, the epidemic continued from where it left off. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic which affects the whole world may create a new opportunity to combat infectious diseases. Not only for COVID-19 but also many infectious diseases, it is necessary to fix the negative socioeconomic and socio-cultural conditions and ensure the sustainability of the new social conditions to be created.","Porsuk, A.

The aim of this study was to gain insight into distribution, number, and size of lymph nodes along the mandible using computed tomography angiography (CTA). METHODS: A total of 52 CTA scans of head/neck region were evaluated retrospectively. Lymph nodes in the submental and submandibular region, related to the origin of the submental artery, were recorded using a three-dimensional coordinate system, and standardized using an iterative closest point algorithm. Results were analyzed for gender, location, size, and number. RESULTS: The mean number and size of lymph nodes were 5.30 ± 2.00 and 5.28 ± 1.29 mm, respectively. The mean distance of the lymph nodes to the origin of the submental artery was 25.53 ± 15.27 mm. There was no significant difference between both sides when comparing size (left: 5.39 ± 1.28; right: 5.17 ± 1.34; P = .19), number (left: 5.46 ± 2.10; right: 5.17 ± 1.96; P = .49), and distance (left: 24.78 ± 12.23; right: 26.32 ± 14.73; P = .19). No significance was found between males and females concerning number (P = .60), size (P = .50), and distance (P = .06). CONCLUSION: The variance of lymph node distribution along the mandible may warrant conducting a CTA scan to maximize the number of transferred lymph nodes and aid in flap design.","Paulus, Vera A A; Winters, Harm; Hummelink, Stefan; Schulten, Sascha; Ulrich, Dietmar J O; Vasilic, Dalibor",J. surg. oncol,,388
397602,Rapid response: activity from a hospital based Urgent Dental Care Centre during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Participatory Design (PD) – whose inclusive benefits are broadly recognised in design – can be very challenging, especially when involving children The recent COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to further barriers to PD with such groups One key barrier is the advent of social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional risks posed for e g children and families vulnerable to COVID-19 This disrupts traditional in-person PD (which involves close socio-emotional and often physical collaboration between participants and researchers) However, alongside such barriers, we have identified opportunities for new and augmented approaches to PD across distributed geographies, backgrounds, ages and abilities We examine Distributed Participatory Design (DPD) as a solution for overcoming these new barriers, during and after COVID-19 We offer new ways to think about DPD, and unpick some of its ambiguities We do this through an examination of the results from an online Interaction Design and Children (IDC) 2020 workshop The workshop included 24 researchers with experience in PD, in a range of forms, in the context of children Initially designed to take place in-person and to include a design session with children in a school in London, the workshop was adjusted to an online format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Despite the adverse circumstances, we discovered that the unexpected change of the workshop style from in-person to online was an opportunity and an impetus for us to address the new PD challenges of the global pandemic In this article we contribute seven themes which were revealed during our IDC workshop, providing guidance on important areas for consideration when planning and conducting PD in the context of a global pandemic With a focus on the term ’distributed’, we offer insights on how DPD can be applied and explored in these circumstances with child participants We conclude with a number of lessons learned, highlighting the opportunities and challenges DPD offers to enable continued co-design during a global pandemic In particular, DPD provides greater access for some populations to be involved in PD, but technical and social challenges must be addressed","Constantin, Aurora Alexandru Cristina Korte Jessica Wilson Cara Fails Jerry Sim Gavin Read Janet C.; Eriksson, Eva",International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction,,388

405362,COVID-19: The Current Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo,2020,"Introduction: 'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. Methods: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HI V amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. Results: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. Conclusions: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","Hill, A ndrew; Wang, Junzheng; Levi, Jacob; Heath, Katie; Fortunak, Joseph",J.

407535,Caution Warranted: Using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Model for Predicting the Course of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide. The reported possible neurological symptoms are varied and range from subtle neurologic deficits to unconsciousness. Knowledge regarding the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19-associated neurological damage is still limited. We report a case of serious neurological damage and mental abnormalities in a patient who was finally confirmed to have COVID-19 based on IgM and IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 68-year-old man had slight flu-like symptoms and transient loss of consciousness in early February. Exaggerated unconsciousness and deteriorating mental abnormalities occurred over the next month without severe respiratory symptoms. Craniocerebral computed tomography showed normal results, but antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were 100 times higher in the CSF than in the serum; tests for viral ribonucleic acid showed negative results with both a nasopharyngeal swab and CSF sample. DIAGNOSIS: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed based on symptoms and positive results for IgM and IgG in the CSF. INTERVENTIONS: Antiviral, fluid, and nutritional support were administered for 30 days before admission without obvious improvement. A further 18 days of routine antiviral therapy, immunoglobulin therapy (10âg per day for 5 days), and antipsychotic drug treatment were administered. OUTCOMES: The patient's neurological and mental abnormalities were greatly ameliorated. He was discharged with mild irritability, slight shaking of the hands, and walking fatigue. These symptoms have persisted up to our last follow-up (May 4, 2020). CONCLUSION: We believe this is the first case involving neural system injury in a patient who confirmed COVID-19 based on CSF antibody test results. Negative ribonucleic acid test results, strong positivity for antibodies, and high protein levels in the CSF suggest the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis secondary to COVID-19. This case highlights additional novel symptoms of COVID-19, and these data are important for the assessment and follow-up of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Maomao; Li, Ting; Qiao, Fan; Wang, Laixing; Li, Chunlin; Gong, Yanping",Medicine (Baltimore),,388

Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can act as a trigger for subacute thyroiditis (SAT). We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar to identify cases of subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 and evaluated patient-level demographics, major clinical features, laboratory findings and outcomes. In the 21 cases that we reviewed, the mean age of patients was 40.0 ± 11.3 years with a greater female preponderance (71.4%). Mean number days between the start of COVID-19 illness and the appearance of SAT symptoms were 25.2 ± 10.1. Five patients were confirmed to have ongoing COVID-19, whereas the infection had resolved in 16 patients before onset of SAT symptoms. Fever and neck pain were the most common presenting complaints (81%). Ninety-four percent of patients reported some type of hyperthyroid symptoms, while the labs in all 21 patients (100%) confirmed this with low TSH and high T3 or T4. Inflammatory markers were elevated in all cases that reported ESR and CRP. All 21 cases (100%) had ultrasound findings suggestive of SAT. Steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs were the mainstay of treatment, and all patients reported resolution of symptoms; however, 5 patients (23.8%) were reported to have a hypothyroid illness on follow-up. Large-scale studies are needed for a better understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, but current evidence suggests that clinicians need to recognize the possibility of SAT both in ongoing and resolved COVID-19 infection to optimize patient care.","Aemaz Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Farooq, Hareem; Ali, Muhammad Mohsin; Ebaad Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Dar, Qudsia Anwar; Hussain, Awab",SN Compr Clin Med,,388

METHODS: Oncology care providers (n=2,008) participated in a survey in which they identified barriers and promoters for delivering psychosocial care at their respective institutions. Multilevel modeling was used to examine (1) the extent to which provider and institutional characteristics were associated with the most common barriers, and (2) associations between perceived barriers and institutional capacity to deliver psychosocial services as measured by the Cancer Psychosocial Care Matrix. RESULTS: Across 58 Commission on Cancer-accredited programs in North America, the most frequently reported barriers were inadequate number of psychosocial care personnel, lack of funding, inadequate amount of time, lack of systematic procedures, and inadequate training for oncology providers. Overall, there were few significant differences in reported barriers by type of institution or type of provider. In general, the most frequently reported barriers were significantly associated with the institution's capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. In particular, the lack of a systematic process for psychosocial care delivery significantly predicted lower levels of institutional capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. CONCLUSIONS: When identifying barriers, respondents reported a greater number of institutional barriers than barriers related to individual provider or patient characteristics. These results present a compelling case for cancer programs to implement and monitor systematic procedures for psychosocial care and to integrate these procedures in routine clinical practice.

This study assesses PM2.5 exposure and health risk during COVID-19, and its driving factors have been analyzed using spatiotemporal big data, including Tencent location-based services (LBS) data, place of interest (POI), and PM2.5 site monitoring data. Specifically, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) is utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 concentration firstly. Then, population exposure and health risks of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 epidemic have been assessed based on LBS data. To further understand the driving factors of PM2.5 pollution, the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and POI data has been quantitatively analyzed using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show the time series coefficients of monthly PM2.5 concentrations distributed with a U-shape, i.e., with a decrease followed by an increase from January to December. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration shows a noteworthy decline over the Central and North China. The LBS-based population density distribution indicates that the health risk of PM2.5 in the west is significantly lower than that in the Middle East. Urban gross domestic product (GDP) and urban green area are negatively correlated with PM2.5; while, road area, urban taxis, urban buses, and urban factories are positive. Among them, the number of urban factories contributes the most to PM2.5 pollution. In terms of reducing the health risks and PM2.5 pollution, several pointed suggestions to improve the status has been proposed.","He, Hongbin; Shen, Yonglin; Jiang, Changmin; Li, Tianqi; Guo, Mingqiang; Yao, Ling",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,388

418743,Effectiveness of a COVID-19 screening questionnaire for pregnant women at admission to an obstetric unit in Milan,2020,"We present METATRYP version 2 software that identifies shared peptides across the predicted proteomes of organisms within environmental metaproteomics studies to enable accurate taxonomic attribution of peptides during protein inference. Improvements include ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the least common ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine METATRYP database with predicted proteomes from environmental sequencing confirms a low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed to facilitate ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa analyzed, sharing <1% peptides with taxa outside of the betacoronavirus group, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches.","Saunders, Jaclyn K; Gaylord, David A; Held, Noelle A; Symmonds, Nicholas; Dupont, Christopher L; Shepherd, Adam; Kinkade, Danie B; Saito, Mak A",J Proteome Res,,388
418744,Effectiveness of a COVID-19 screening questionnaire for pregnant women at admission to an obstetric unit in Milan,2020,"Novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic that has impacted the entire world. The Indian government has responded strongly and very stringently to the crisis, through a nationwide lockdown. The health-care (HC) systems in the country are striving hard to maintain equitable care across illness spectra, while responding the emergencies imposed by the COVID-19 crisis. Under these circumstances, guidelines for managing several diseases including that for cancer care have been modified. As modified guidelines for cancer care have their focus on disease management, cancer pain management and maintaining continuity of care for patients with advanced progressive disease have taken a backseat in the available cancer care guidelines. This article describes the challenges, approaches to solutions with evidence-based practices that can be utilized to ensure competent management of cancer pain during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It provides an overview of adapting to telehealth consultations for identification, evaluation and management of cancer pain, safe and rational use of analgesics and adjuvant drugs, recognizing and responding to holistic care needs and addressing the total pain, ensuring continuity of pain management, and strategies when complying with narcotic drug regulations, while ensuring safety of patients and HC providers.","Damani, Anuja; Ghoshal, Arunangshu; Salins, Naveen; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Sanghavi, Priti; Viswanath, Vidya; Ostwal, Shrenik; Chinchalkar, Gauraiya; Vallath, Nandini",Indian J.

418745,Effectiveness of a COVID-19 screening questionnaire for pregnant women at admission to an obstetric unit in Milan,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection (CDBC), and therefore contributing to their early identification and prognosis estimation. METHOD: 905 COVID-19 patients from 7 different centers were enrolled. The demography data, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and treatments were collected accordingly for further analyses. RESULTS: Around 9.5% of the enrolled COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with CDBC. Older patients or patients with cardiovascular comorbidities have increased CDBC probability. Increased body temperature, longer fever duration, anhelation, gastrointestinal symptoms, illness severity, intensive care unit attending, ventilation treatment, glucocorticoid therapy, longer hospitalization time are correlated to CDBC. Among laboratory results, increased white blood cell counting (mainly neutrophil), lymphocytopenia, increased procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reaction protein, D-dimer, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, brain natriuretic peptide, myoglobin, blood sugar and decreased albumin are also observed, indicating multiple system functional damage. Radiology results suggested ground glass opacity mixed with high density effusion opacities and even pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: The aged COVID-19 patients with increased inflammatory indicators, worse lymphopenia and cardiovascular comorbidities are more likely to have clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection. Moreover, they tend to have severer clinical manifestations and increased probability of multiple system functional damage.","He, Shengyang; Liu, Wenlong; Jiang, Mingyan; Huang, Peng; Xiang, Zhi; Deng, Dingding; Chen, Ping; Xie, Lihua",PLoS One,,388

422636,Impact of COVID-19 on maxillofacial surgery practice: a worldwide survey,2020,"In the care of patients with operable breast cancer, there has been a shift toward increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy. There are benefits to neoadjuvant therapy, such as monitoring for response, as well as an increased rate of breast conservation and reduction of potential morbidity associated with breast surgery, including axillary management. Among patients with highly proliferative tumors, such as HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, those with residual disease are at higher risk of recurrence, which informs the recommended systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting. For instance, in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, there is a role for adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine for those with residual disease at the time of surgery. The same holds true regarding the role of adjuvant capecitabine in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With the added complexities of treating patients in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak, additional considerations are critical, including initiation of surgery within an appropriate time from completion of neoadjuvant therapy. National consensus guidelines on time to surgery must be developed to improve measurement and comparison across systems. In addition, there is emerging radiation treatment management research addressing a number of factors, including hypofractionation, role of proton beam therapy, safe omission of radiotherapy, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without drug combination. In this article, the multidisciplinary approach of treating patients with operable breast cancer is highlighted, with updates and future considerations described.","Obeng-Gyasi, Samilia; Coles, Charlotte E; Jones, Jade; Sacks, Ruth; Lightowlers, Sara; Bliss, Judith M; Brunt, A Murray; Haviland, Joanne S; Kirby, Anna M; Kalinsky, Kevin",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,,388
423281,Recommended Personal Protective Equipment for Cochlear Implant and Other Mastoid Surgery During the COVID-19 Era,2020,"Since the reporting of the first cases of coronavirus in China and the publication of the first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the virus has undergone numerous mutations. In Europe, the spring outbreak (March-April) was followed by a drop in the number of cases and deaths. The disease may have evolved into a milder form. The increase in PCR-positive cases in late summer 2020 did not lead to the expected increase in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths, based on the severity of the disease in the spring. This difference in disease severity could be due to factors independent of the virus or to the evolution of the virus. This review attempts to identify the mutations that have appeared since the beginning of the pandemic and their role in the temporal evolution of the pandemic. There are a cell and humoral type cross-reactivity in a large part of the population to common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2. Evolutionarily important mutations and deletions have emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding proteins that interact with the host immune system. In addition, one of the major mutations (in viral polymerase) is logically associated with a higher frequency of mutations throughout the genome. This frequency fluctuates over time and shows a peak at the time when the epidemic was most active. The rate of mutations in proteins involved in the relationship to the immune system continues to increase after the first outbreak. The cross-reactivity on the 1 hand and the viral mutations observed on the other hand could explain the evolution of the pandemic until the summer of 2020, partly due to the evolution of the virus in relation to the host immune system. The immunization campaign began in December 2020: concerns are emerging about a possible escape of the circulating variants vaccines in early 2021. These variants could also escape immunity acquired through infection with the 2020 strains.","Banoun, Helene",Nephron,,388

Since the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., Massachusetts has been leading other states in the total number of COVID-19 cases. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing site access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: (1) Residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COVID-19 infections among minority groups. (2) Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Non-Hispanic Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of the accessibility of testing sites by all populations. (3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection. (4) Different from the findings of previous studies, the elderly population rate is not statistically significantly correlated with the incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hotspot regions of COVID-19 infections. The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts.","Hu, Tao; Yue, Han; Wang, Changzhen; She, Bing; Ye, Xinyue; Liu, Regina; Zhu, Xinyan; Guan, Weihe Wendy; Bao, Shuming",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,388

This study describes lung, chest wall and respiratory-system mechanics in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS. METHODS: Data was collected from forty patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Esophageal balloons were placed to estimate pleural and transpulmonary pressures. Clinical characteristics, respiratory-system, transpulmonary, and chest-wall mechanics were measured over the first week. RESULTS: Patients had moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 123[98-149]) and were critically ill (APACHE IV 108 [94-128] and SOFA 12 [11-13]). PaO2/FiO2 improved over the first week (150 mmHg [122.9-182] to 185 mmHg [138-228] (p = 0.035)). Respiratory system (30-35 ml/cm H2O), lung (40-50 ml/cm H2O) and chest wall (120-150 ml/cm H2O) compliance remained similar over the first week. Elevated basal pleural pressures correlated with BMI. Patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation (14.5 days [9.5-19.0]), with a mortality of 32.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients displayed normal chest-wall mechanics, with increased basal pleural pressure. Respiratory system and lung mechanics were similar to known existing ARDS cohorts. The wide range of respiratory system mechanics illustrates the inherent heterogeneity that is consistent with typical ARDS.","Baedorf Kassis, Elias; Schaefer, Maximilian S; Maley, Jason H; Hoenig, Ben; Loo, Ying; Hayes, Margaret M; Moskowitz, Ari; Talmor, Daniel",J Crit Care,,388

Prolonged exposure to backlit screens before sleep influences the circadian system leading to negative consequences on sleep health. We investigated the relationship between changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. METHODS: 2,123 Italians (mean age ± standard deviation, 33.1 ± 11.6) were tested longitudinally during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. The second assessment survey inquired about intervening changes in backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. RESULTS: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and individuals reporting moderate/severe insomnia symptoms increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving screen time habits did not show variations of the sleep parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between modifications of evening electronic device usage and time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Monitoring the potential impact of excessive evening exposure to backlit screens on sleep health is recommendable during the current period of restraining measures due to COVID-19.","Salfi, Federico; Amicucci, Giulia; Corigliano, Domenico; D039,; Atri, Aurora; Viselli, Lorenzo; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",Sleep,,388

We previously found that myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-derived arginase-1 (Arg-1) promoted Th17 cell differentiation in SLE. In the present study, we performed RNA-chip to identify the microRNA regulation network between MDSCs and Th17 cells. miR-542-5p in humans, as the homologous gene of miR-322-5p in mice was significantly up-regulated in the Th17+MDSC group compared with Th17 cells cultured alone and down-regulated in the Th17+MDSC+Arg-1 inhibitor group compared with the Th17+MDSC group. We further evaluated the miR-322-5p and Th17/Treg balance in mice and found that the proportions of both Th17 cells and Tregs were elevated and that miR-322-5p overexpression activated the transforming growth factor-ß pathway. Moreover, although miR-322-5p expression was higher in SLE mice, it decreased after treatment with an Arg-1 inhibitor. The proportion of Th17 cells and Th17/Treg ratio correlated with miR-322-5p levels. In conclusion, MDSC-derived Arg-1 and mmu-miR-322-5p not only promote Th17 cell and Treg differentiation, but also shift the Th17/Treg ratio in SLE. The Arg-1/miR-322-5p axis may serve as a novel treatment target for SLE.","Pang, Bo; Zhen, Yu; Hu, Cong; Ma, Zhanchuan; Lin, Shan; Yi, Huanfa",Clin Sci (Lond),,388

This study aims to discover the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female healthcare professionals (HCPs) treating COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. METHODS: Using an empirical phenomenological methodology, semi-structured telephone-based qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 female HCPs who were providing their expertise for COVID-19 patients in tertiary-level hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. Purposive sampling was used for recruitment. The interviews were conducted between 20 July and 20 August 2020. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: This study explored the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female HCPs serving COVID-19 patients. Five themes were observed in the interviews: apprehension while treating COVID-19 patients; feelings towards COVID-19 patients; challenges as female HCPs and coping strategies; confidence in government, administration and self-reflection; and finally, future concerns and recommendations. Many of these themes have also been linked with cultural issues, making the results specific to Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, female frontline HCPs have faced immense psychosocial pressure, ranging from unsupportive family norms to an unwelcoming working environment and insensitive hospital administrations. Moreover, rumours among the general public, lack of proper training, missing incentives and improper system surveillance have increased the anxiety and stress among HCPs. Hence, legislators are advised to take appropriate actions countrywide in order to alleviate the still ongoing challenges and support female HCPs in their working environment.","Shahbaz, Sumbal; Ashraf, Muhammad Zeshan; Zakar, Rubeena; Fischer, Florian",BMC Womens Health,,388

Nearly the entire human physiological system can get disrupted by the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which exemplifies the significance of discovering a potential drug target. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. This review discusses the potential for bitter taste receptors to act as drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and the use of existing bitter agonists to restore T2R function.","Kumar, S A; Cheng, Weyland",Pharmazie,,388

METHODS: A prospective non-randomized open-label study was undertaken from May to August 2020 on 75 subjects (aged 18-70 years) hospitalized in Siloam Kelapa Dua Hospital. Uni- and multi-variable Cox regression analyses were performed to obtain hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcomes were: (1) length of hospital stay; (2) time to negative swab; and (3) radiological outcome (time to improvement on chest x ray). RESULTS: None of the 75 patients with COVID-19 required intensive care. All patients were angiotensin-receptor-blocker naïve. In comparison with the control group, the candesartan group had a significantly shorter hospital stay [adjusted HR 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-5.29] after adjusting for a wide range of confounders, and no increased risk of intensive care. In the non-obese subgroup, the candesartan group had a shorter time to negative swab (unadjusted HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.02-4.36; adjusted HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.08-5.09) and shorter time to improvement in chest x ray (adjusted HR 2.82, 95% CI 1.13-7.03) compared with the control group.

445084,Role of systems science in preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases: protocol for a scoping review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2) is responsible for the infectious respiratory disease called COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, point-of-care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate the performance of two POC tests, COVID-PRESTO® and COVID-DUO®, compared to the gold standard, RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). METHODS: RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 was performed from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in adult patients visiting the infectious disease department at the hospital (Orléans, France). Capillary whole blood (CWB) samples from the fingertip taken at different time points after onset of the disease were tested with POC tests. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits compared to test of reference (RT-PCR) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 381 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who went to the hospital for a diagnostic, 143 patients were RT-PCR negative. Results of test with POC tests were all negative for these patients, indicating a specificity of 100% for both POC tests. In the RT-PCR positive subgroup (n = 238), 133 patients were tested with COVID-PRESTO® and 129 patients were tested with COVID-DUO® (24 patients tested with both). The further the onset of symptoms was from the date of collection, the greater the sensitivity. The sensitivity of COVID-PRESTO® test ranged from 10.00% for patients having experienced their 1st symptoms from 0 to 5 days ago to 100% in patients where symptoms had occurred more than 15 days before the date of tests. For COVID-DUO® test, the sensitivity ranged from 35.71% [0-5 days] to 100% (> 15 days). CONCLUSION: COVID-PRESTO® and DUO® POC tests turned out to be very specific (none false positive) and to be sensitive enough after 15 days from onset of symptom. These easy to use IgG/IgM combined test kits are the first ones allowing a screening with CWB sample, by typing from a finger prick. These rapid tests are particularly interesting for screening in low resource settings.","Prazuck, Thierry; Colin, Mathilda; Giachè, Susanna; Gubavu, Camélia; Seve, Aymeric; Rzepecki, Vincent; Chevereau-Choquet, Marie; Kiani, Catherine; Rodot, Victor; Lionnet, Elsa; Courtellemont, Laura; Guinard, Jérôme; Pialoux, Gilles; Hocqueloux, Laurent",PLoS One,,388

Early prediction of the clinical progression was essential but still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the timeline of COVID-19 development and analyze risk factors of disease progression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 333 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from 10 January to 10 February 2020. Epidemiological feature, clinical records, laboratory and radiology manifestations were collected and analyzed. 323 patients with mild-moderate symptoms on admission were observed to determine whether they exacerbated to severe-critically ill conditions (progressive group) or not (stable group). We used logistic regression to identify the risk factors associated with clinical progression. RESULTS: Of all the 333 patients, 70 (21.0%) patients progressed into severe-critically ill conditions during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group, 253 (76.0%) patients belonged to the stable group, another 10 patients were severe before admission. we found that the clinical features of aged over 40 (3.80 [1.72, 8.52]), males (2.21 [1.20, 4.07]), with comorbidities (1.78 [1.13, 2.81]) certain exposure history (0.38 [0.20, 0.71]), abnormal radiology manifestations (3.56 [1.13, 11.40]), low level of T lymphocytes (0.99 [0.997, 0.999]), high level of NLR (0.99 [0.97, 1.01]), IL-6 (1.05 [1.03, 1.07]) and CRP (1.67 [1.12, 2.47]) were the risk factors of disease progression by logistic regression.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the adolescents' perceptions of preventive behaviors to avoid COVID-19 disease based on the health belief model (HBM). METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 797adolescents (aged between 12 and 18 years old), who were 7th-12th -grade students of 24 randomly selected schools from 28th May to June 28, 2020 in Isfahan, Iran. An online self-administered questionnaire was adapted to measure the adolescents' perceived threats, barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, and cues to action toward protective behaviors. RESULTS: Findings indicated that the adolescents' mean age was 14.7 (SD = 1.7) and 53.7% of them were female. Regardless of gender difference, there was a significant positive correlation between the adolescents' protective behaviors and their self-efficacy (r = 0.62, P < 0.001), perceived benefit (r = 29, P < 0.001), and perceived severity (r = 0.15, P < 0.001), while there was a significant negative correlation between the adolescents' protective behaviors and their perceived susceptibility (r = -0.11, P < 0.001), as well as their perceived barrier (r = -0.21, P < 0.001). The result of the Hierarchical regression analysis also revealed that the HBM model had a significant predictive power for preventing measures towards coronavirus disease in adolescents (Adj R2 = 0.46, p < 0.001). The results also showed that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor (ß = 0.59, P < 0.001) in explaining protective behaviors in adolescents. CONCLUSION: In the context of coronavirus disease pandemic in adolescents, the health belief model could provide a useful framework for planners to develop educational programs. Moreover, in such a context, strategies to promote self-efficacy in adolescents should be considered more carefully to help them improve their protective behaviors.","Fathian-Dastgerdi, Zohreh; Khoshgoftar, Mohadeseh; Tavakoli, Banafsheh; Jaleh, Maryam",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,388
446333,A Virtual Ward Model of Care for Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Single-Center Clinical Study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for the outcome of COVID-19. We investigated whether the specific immune responses in the peripheral blood of 276 patients associated to severity and progression of COVID-19. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. Conversely, the proportion of B cells, plasmablasts, circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) and CD56-CD16+ NK-cells increased. Regarding humoral immunity, levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected, but when degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients. Compared to healthy donors, complement C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, while the activation peptide of C5 (C5a) increased from the admission in every patient, regardless their severity. Moreover, total IgG, the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, associating severity with an imbalanced humoral response and identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.

450705,"Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Balancing Infection Control, Quality of Life, and Resilience",2020,"The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we permanently need high-value flexible solutions to urgent clinical needs including simplified diagnostic technologies suitable for use in the field and for delivering targeted therapeutics. From our perspective nanotechnology is revealed as a vital resource for this, as a generic platform of technical solutions to tackle complex medical challenges. It is towards this perspective and focusing on nanomedicine that we take issue with Prof Park's recent editorial published in the Journal of Controlled Release. Prof. Park argued that in the last 15 years nanomedicine failed to deliver the promised innovative clinical solutions to the patients (Park, K. The beginning of the end of the nanomedicine hype. Journal of Controlled Release, 2019; 305, 221-222 [1]. We, the ETPN (European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine) [2], respectfully disagree. In fact, the more than 50 formulations currently in the market, and the recent approval of 3 key nanomedicine products (e. g. Onpattro, Hensify and Vyxeos), have demonstrated that the nanomedicine field is concretely able to design products that overcome critical barriers in conventional medicine in a unique manner, but also to deliver within the cells new drug-free therapeutic effects by using pure physical modes of action, and therefore make a difference in patients lives. Furthermore, the >400 nanomedicine formulations currently in clinical trials are expecting to bring novel clinical solutions (e.g. platforms for nucleic acid delivery), alone or in combination with other key enabling technologies to the market, including biotechnologies, microfluidics, advanced materials, biomaterials, smart systems, photonics, robotics, textiles, Big Data and ICT (information & communication technologies) more generally. However, we agree with Prof. Park that "" it is time to examine the sources of difficulty in clinical translation of nanomedicine and move forward "". But for reaching this goal, the investments to support clinical translation of promising nanomedicine formulations should increase, not decrease. As recently encouraged by EMA in its roadmap to 2025, we should create more unity through a common knowledge hub linking academia, industry, healthcare providers and hopefully policy makers to reduce the current fragmentation of the standardization and regulatory body landscape. We should also promote a strategy of cross-technology innovation, support nanomedicine development as a high value and low-cost solution to answer unmet medical needs and help the most promising innovative projects of the field to get better and faster to the clinic.

450985,"Knowledge, attitude and practice of patients with chronic diseases towards COVID-19 pandemic in Dessie town hospitals, Northeast Ethiopia",2021,"There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.","Han, Yuling; Duan, Xiaohua; Yang, Liuliu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Wang, Pengfei; Duan, Fuyu; Tang, Xuming; Yaron, Tomer M; Zhang, Tuo; Uhl, Skyler; Bram, Yaron; Richardson, Chanel; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhao, Zeping; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Jessurun, Jose; Borczuk, Alain; Huang, Yaoxing; Johnson, Jared L; Liu, Yuru; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Cantley, Lewis C; tenOever, Benjamin R; Ho, David D; Pan, Fong Cheng; Evans, Todd; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Schwartz, Robert E; Chen, Shuibing",Nature (Lond.),,388
451169,Low-risk clinic model in oral surgery clinic during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Large pre-trained language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have acquired a surprising ability to perform zero-shot learning. For example, to classify sentiment without any training examples, we can""prompt""the LM with the review and the label description""Does the user like this movie?"", and ask whether the next word is""yes""or""no"". However, the next word prediction training objective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a collection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the meta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label descriptions in a question-answering (QA) format. When evaluated on unseen tasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-sized QA model and the previous SOTA zero-shot learning system based on natural language inference. Additionally, increasing parameter count from 220M to 770M improves AUC-ROC scores by 6.3%, and we forecast that even larger models would perform better. Therefore, measuring zero-shot learning performance on language models out-of-the-box might underestimate their true potential, and community-wide efforts on aggregating datasets and unifying their formats can help build models that answer prompts better.","Zhong, Ruiqi; Lee, Kristy; Zhang, Zheng; Klein, Dan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04670v5.pdf,388

453059,114 A service evaluation of video consultations in a UK hospice during the Covid-19 pandemic: learning from patients’ and carers’ feedback,2021,"Cytokine storm (CS), an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines upon overactivation of the innate immune system, came recently to the focus of interest because of its role in the life-threatening consequences of certain immune therapies and viral diseases, including CAR-T cell therapy and Covid-19. Because complement activation with subsequent anaphylatoxin release is in the core of innate immune stimulation, studying the relationship between complement activation and cytokine release in an in vitro CS model holds promise to better understand CS and identify new therapies against it. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in the presence of autologous serum to test the impact of complement activation and inhibition on cytokine release, testing the effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), zymosan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as immune activators and heat inactivation of serum, EDTA and mini-factor H (mfH) as complement inhibitors. These activators induced significant rises of complement activation markers C3a, C4a, C5a, Ba, Bb, and sC5b-9 at 45 min of incubation, with or without ~5- to ~2,000-fold rises of IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNF&#945; at 6 and 18 h later. Inhibition of complement activation by the mentioned three methods had differential inhibition, or even stimulation of certain cytokines, among which effects a limited suppressive effect of mfH on IL-6 secretion and significant stimulation of IL-10 implies anti-CS and anti-inflammatory impacts. These findings suggest the utility of the model for in vitro studies on CS, and the potential clinical use of mfH against CS.","Kozma, Gergely Tibor; Mészáros, Tamás; Bakos, Tamás; Hennies, Mark; Bencze, Dániel; Uzonyi, Barbara; Gyorffy, Balázs; Cedrone, Edward; Dobrovolskaia, Marina A; Józsi, Mihály; Szebeni, János",Front Immunol,,388

The determination of the factors affecting transmission rate is urgent and crucial to combat COVID-19. Here we explored variation of R t between 277 regions across the globe and the associated potential socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors. At global scale, the R t started to decrease approximately two weeks after policy interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions initiation to the date when R t started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, largest in Europe and North America. We find that proportion of elderly people or life expectancy can explain 50% of variation in transmission rate across the 277 regions. The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R I ) increases by 29.4% (25.2-34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, indicating elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R I is only -2.7% (-5.2 - 0%) per °C after excluding collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. This low temperature sensitivity of R I suggests that a warm summer is unlikely to impede the spread of COVID-19 naturally.","Su, Ming; Peng, Shushi; Chen, Lili; Wang, Bin; Wang, Ying; Fan, Xiarui; Dong, Zhaomin",Geohealth,,388

Correlation curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient, depending on the number of days the indicator has been shifted. Primary endpoint was the number of ICU patients. EMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated (R2 ranging between 0.79 to 0.99, all P<0.001) with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipate ICU bed requirement. A qualitative analysis of the onset of the second wave period of the epidemic (August 1 to September 15, 2020) in the same region provided similar results. The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits.

One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chem Lab Med,,388

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic Radiology (DR) studies and Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures at a single tertiary-care teaching institution between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. DR was divided by section: body, cardiothoracic, musculoskeletal (MSK), neuroradiology, nuclear medicine, pediatrics, and women's imaging. IR was divided by procedural types: arterial, venous, lymphatic, core, neuro, pediatrics, dialysis, cancer embolization or ablation, noncancer embolization, portal hypertension, and miscellaneous. Impact on didactic education was also assessed. ANOVA, t test, and multiple comparison correction were used for analysis. RESULTS: DR and IR caseloads decreased significantly in April 2020 compared to April of the prior 5 years (both p < 0.0001). Case volumes were reduced in body (49.2%, p < 0.01), MSK (54.2%, p < 0.05), neuro (39.3%, p < 0.05), and women's imaging (75.5%, p < 0.05) in DR, and in arterial (62.6%, p < 0.01), neuro IR (57.6%, p < 0.01) and core IR (42.6%, p < 0.05) in IR. IR trainee average caseload in April 2020 decreased 51.9% compared to April of the prior 5 years (p < 0.01). Utilization of online learning increased in April. Trainees saw significant increases in overall DR didactics (31.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.02) and no reduction in IR didactics, all online. Twelve major national and international DR and IR meetings were canceled or postponed between March and July. CONCLUSION: Decreases in caseload and widespread cancellation of conferences have had significant impact on DR/IR training during COVID-19 restrictions. Remote learning technologies with annotated case recording, boards-style case reviews, procedural simulation and narrated live cases as well as online lectures and virtual journal clubs increased during this time. Whether remote learning can mitigate lost opportunities from in-person interactions remains uncertain. Optimizing these strategies will be important for potential future restricted learning paradigms and can also be extrapolated to augment trainee education during unrestricted times.","Gabr, Ahmed M; Li, Ningcheng; Schenning, Ryan C; Elbarbary, Aly; Anderson, James C; Kaufman, John A; Farsad, Khashayar",Acad Radiol,,388

The aim of the paper is to show that, although Desaguliers demonstrated a commitment to Newton's work, his own natural philosophical objectives also led him to borrow ideas from natural philosophers outside Newton's direct sphere of influence. To do this I shall give an account of what Desaguliers appropriated from Newton's Principia, how it fitted in with his own project and how he also made use of other natural philosophers' theories in his discussion of fluid mechanics. This will hopefully result in a more nuanced conception of Desaguliers' 'Newtonianism' that takes into account the diverse sources and influences in his work.","Morris, Andrew M A",Notes Rec R Soc Lond,,388

A comprehensive search was conducted to present 16 trial registries from around the world. Collectively, there are 1,528 trials reported for COVID-19 to date. Out of them, 50 studies included paediatric age group from day 0 to less than or equal to 18 years of age. A few 18 studies involve only females and 20 only males. There are 2 trials currently underway in Bangladesh, 4 in Pakistan and 13 in India. Overall, 940 trials are related to medicines and/or interventions. They include standard of care for any viral illness, antivirals, anti-inflammatory and immune altering medications. Two out of 10 vaccine trials are novel vaccines. It is knowledgeable and resourceful to reach out to the concerned sponsor if a physician thinks his patient can benefit from the trials in the region.","Ejaz, Kiran; Kauser, Tanveer; Siddiqa, Amnah",J Pak Med Assoc,,388
484473,Digital disparities: designing telemedicine systems with a health equity aim,2021,"Studying the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) can aid in protecting them from exposure. Existing studies related to HCW infections have emphasized infection rates and protective measures. However, the spatiotemporal patterns and related external environmental factors of HCW infections remain unclear. To fill this gap, an open-source dataset of HCW diagnoses was provided, and the spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in Wuhan, China were explored. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators of HCW infections. The results showed that the number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution, with and its mean observed on January 23, 2020 and a standard deviation of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for HCWs in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. Moreover, HCW infections displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factors analyses revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection. These findings can aid national epidemic prevention and control departments to understand the spatiotemporal distributions of viral transmission resulting in HCW infections, as well as external influencing factors, which can facilitate the protection of HCWs in China.","Wang, Peixiao; Ren, Hui; Hu, Tao; Fu, Xiaokang; Liu, Hongqiang; Zhu, Xinyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08819v1.pdf,388

487596,Community Factors Associated With Telemedicine Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Objective: In this article, we present a digital tool (Diversity Perspectives in Annual Reports [DivPAR]) for automated content analysis of annual reports, designed to identify the presence of three cultural diversity perspectives-the Moral, Market, and Innovation perspectives-based on earlier work by Ely and Thomas (2001). Method: In Study 1, we describe the development and validation of the instrument, through an iterative procedure in which manual annotation of independent subsamples (n = 24, 25) by human coders was compared to the computer coding in subsequent rounds, until sufficient agreement was reached. In Study 2, we illustrate the type of data that the script generates, by analyzing the prevalence of the three perspectives in annual reports of 55 Dutch organizations over a period of 2 decades (1999-2018; n = 937). Results: Our findings confirm that DivPAR is sufficiently reliable for use in future research. In Study 2, we show that among Dutch organizations, the moral perspective is most prevalent, but the market and innovation perspectives are increasing in popularity. Conclusion: DivPAR can be used to analyze the prevalence and longitudinal development of diversity perspectives in organizational communication. It enables scholars to draw comparisons across different sectors, regions, or countries, to study how diversity perspectives correlate with societal developments, and to uncover the (lack of) relationships between diversity communication and diversity outcomes. Directions for future research are discussed at the end of the article.

492824,19 Do patients with COVID-19 require different end of life medications? – The experiences of a dual site Hospital Palliative Care Team,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cumulative data of case-fatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19 varied across countries. A forecasting model generated based on detailed information from three countries during the initial phase of pandemic showed that progression rates from pneumonia to ARDS (PRPA) varied by country and were highly associated with CFR. We aim to elucidate the impact of the PRPA on COVID-19 deaths in different periods of pandemic. METHODS: We used the country-based, real-time global COVID-19 data through GitHub repository to estimate PRPA on the first period (January to June), second period (July to September), and third period (October to December) in 2020. PRPA was used for predicting COVID-19 deaths and assessing the reduction in deaths in subsequent two periods. RESULTS: The estimated PRPA varied widely from 0.38% to 51.36%, with an average of 15.99% in the first period. The PRPA declined to 8.44% and 6.35% in the second and third period. The CFR declined stepwise and was 4.94%, 2.61%, and 1.96%, respectively. Some countries exhibited a decrease in the PRPA from the second to the third period whereas others showed the opposite, particularly where selected viral mutants were prevalent. Overall, the number of observed deaths was lower than that of the predicted deaths in the second and third periods, suggesting an improvement in management of COVID-19 patients. Besides, the degree of improvement depends on the extent of change in PRPA. CONCLUSION: PRPA is a useful indicator to facilitate decision making and assess the improvement of clinical management and medical capacity by forecasting deaths.","Chang, Wei-Jung; Chen, Yee-Chun; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Chih-Dao; Li-Sheng Chen, Sam; Chang, King-Jen",J Formos Med Assoc,,388

In the period of April to June 2020, 105 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 met the conditions for inclusion in the present study. They were treated with antiviral therapy according to local guidelines: D group (53 cases), treated with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r);and K group (52 cases), treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Patients from the K group required 7.5 days of hospitalization less compared to those from the D group (P&lt;0.001). The blood oxygen saturation values recorded in the groups were statistically different [K group (94.02+/-3.12%) vs. D group (92.13+/-4.24%), P=0.010]. The percentage of patients with unsatisfactory clinical evolution were non-significantly higher in the D group compared with the K group [20 (37.74%) vs. 12 (23.08%), P=0.157]. We did not note statistically significant differences between the two groups tracked considering the values for the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS) of the patients with unsatisfactory clinical evolution, nor of the chest CT' evolution after 10 days of therapy. We did not register significant adverse effects after antiviral therapy in the two groups. Antiviral therapy with LPV/r had some favorable results compared to DRV/r in patients with COVID-19. Both therapies were well tolerated.","Negrut, N.; Codrean, A.; Hodisan, I.; Bungau, S.; Tit, D. M.; Marin, R.; Behl, T.; Banica, F.; Diaconu, C. C.; Nistor-Cseppento, D.

In many cases, this has challenged patient-centered care. We set out to examine individuals' attitudes toward shared decision making (SDM) and to identify predictors of participation preference during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a large convenience sample (N = 1061). Our main measures of interest were participants' generic and COVID-19-related participation preference as well as their acceptance and distress regarding a triage vignette. We also assessed anxiety, e-health literacy, and aspects of participants' health. We conducted group comparisons and multiple linear regression analyses on participation preference as well as triage acceptance. RESULTS: In generic decision making, most participants expressed a strong need for information and a moderate participation preference. In the hypothetical case of COVID-19 infection, most preferred physician-led decisions. Generic participation preference was the strongest predictor of COVID-19-related participation preference, followed by age, education, and anxiety. Furthermore, both higher generic and COVID-19-related participation preferences predicted lower triage acceptance. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate potential health care recipients' attitudes toward SDM during a severe health care crisis and emphasize that participation preference varies according to the context.","Köther, Anja K; Siebenhaar, Katharina U; Alpers, Georg W",Med Decis Making,,388
496821,Trends in Anxiety and Depression Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from the US Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey,2021,"Global sequencing of genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to reveal new genetic variants that are the key to unraveling its early evolutionary history and tracking its global spread over time. Here we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history and spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of thousands of high-quality genomes. We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, reconstructed through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed to infer the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. This progenitor genome differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the United States harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains that have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia as well as continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We have developed a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).","Kumar, Sudhir; Tao, Qiqing; Weaver, Steven; Sanderford, Maxwell; Caraballo-Ortiz, Marcos A; Sharma, Sudip; Pond, Sergei L K; Miura, Sayaka",Mol Biol Evol,,388

Cependant, cette approche nécessite une large adhésion de la population pour être efficace. Cependant, depuis mars, de telles applications n’ont été installées que par 9,3 % des personnes dans le monde. Nos objectifs étaient d’estimer, en France, l’acceptabilité d’une application utilisant les téléphones mobiles pour retracer les contacts étroits entre les personnes lors d’épidémies, et les barrières potentielles à son utilisation. Méthodes Nos données ont été collectées parallèlement à l’enquête « Health Literacy Survey 2019 » réalisée en ligne auprès de 1003 français deux semaines après la fin du premier confinement en France (du 27 mai au 5 juin 2020). Les données utilisées étaient les caractéristiques sociodémographiques, la littératie en santé, la confiance dans les institutions et les connaissances sur la COVID-19 et les comportements préventifs. L’acceptabilité d’une application mobile de traçage a été mesurée par le biais d’une question ad hoc, dont les réponses ont été regroupées en trois modalités : App-partisan, App-favorable et App-réticent. Résultats Seulement 19,2 % étaient des partisans de l’application tandis que la moitié des participants (50,3 %) étaient réticents. Les facteurs associés à la non-réticence (App-adepte, App-favorable) étaient : l‘absence de difficultés financières et l’utilité perçue d’applications mobiles pour envoyer des questionnaires de santé aux médecins. L’âge de plus de 60 ans, la confiance dans les représentants politiques, les préoccupations envers la situation pandémique et des connaissances adéquates sur la transmission du SARS-CoV-2 augmentaient la probabilité d’adhérer complétement à l’application de traçage. Conclusion Les personnes les plus démunies, connues pour être plus à risque d’être atteintes par la COVID-19, sont également les plus réticentes à utiliser une application de traçage des contacts. Par conséquent, une adhésion optimale nécessite de mieux comprendre ces réticences et de larges campagnes de sensibilisation, proposant un discours rationalisé sur les avantages de santé publique d’adopter une telle application.","Touzani, R.; Schultz, E.; Holmes, S.; Vandentorren, S.; Arwidson, P.; Guillemin, F.; Rey, D.; Rouquette, A.; Bouhnik, A.; Mancini, J.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,388

MethodsA survival analysis was performed using data from national health databases. Data from people between 18 and 59 years old infected with SARS-CoV-2 as evidenced by molecular or antigenic tests were included. Kaplan Meier graphs were produced to compare the survival of health workers and the rest of the population during 2021 and health workers during the first and second wave of mortality in Peru in 2020 and 2021, respectively. ResultsData from 998,295 people were included. The average age was 41.2 years (SD 15.8) and 485,167 (48.6%) were women. A higher level of survival of health workers after vaccination was found compared to the general population and to the population of health workers before vaccination. It was evidenced that, at the beginning of the second wave, the risk of dying for health workers was twice that of the first wave (HR = 2). After vaccination (in the sixth month of the second wave), the risk of dying decreased to 87.5% less than in the first wave (HR = 0.125). ConclusionsA positive change has been evidenced in the level of survival of health workers infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the context of vaccination against COVID-19 in Peru.","Escobar-Agreda, Stefan; Silva-Valencia, Javier; Rojas-Mezarina, Leonardo; Vargas-Herrera, Javier",,,388
502830,COVID-19 Highlights the Need for Trained Social Workers in Nursing Homes,2020,"As COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, incidence varies greatly among different countries. These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.","Hellwig, Martin D; Maia, Anabela",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,388

505943,Care Transitions to the Community from Veterans Affairs Nursing Homes: Experiences of Social Connection and Disconnection,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed significant public health problems for the human populations worldwide after the 1918 influenza A virus (IVA) (H1N1) pandemic. Although numerous efforts have been made to unravel the mechanisms underlying the coronavirus, a notable gap remains in our perception of the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The innate and adaptive immune systems have a pivotal role in the fate of viral infections, such as COVID-19 pandemic. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known as short noncoding RNA molecules and appear as indispensable governors of almost any cellular means. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that miRNAs participate in essential mechanisms of cell biology, regulation of the immune system, and the onset and progression of numerous types of disorders. The immune responses to viral respiratory infections (VRIs), including influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus (RV), are correlated with the ectopic expression of miRNAs. Alterations of the miRNA expression in epithelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic and acute airway infections. Hence, analyzing the role of these types of nucleotides in antiviral immune responses and the characterization of miRNA target genes might contribute to understanding the mechanisms of the interplay between the host and viruses, and in the future, potentially result in discovering therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of acute COVID-19 infection. In this article, we present a general review of current studies concerning the function of miRNAs in different VRIs, particularly in coronavirus infection, and address all available therapeutic prospects to mitigate the burden of viral infections.","Mirzaei, Rasoul; Mahdavi, Farzad; Badrzadeh, Fariba; Hosseini-Fard, Seyed Reza; Heidary, Maryam; Jeda, Ali Salimi; Mohammadi, Tayeb; Roshani, Mahdane; Yousefimashouf, Rasoul; Keyvani, Hossein; Darvishmotevalli, Mohammad; Sani, Melika Zarei; Karampoor, Sajad",Int Immunopharmacol,,388

Little is still known about the impact of COVID‐19 on pregnant women and neonates. A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guideline recommendations, searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies’ quality assessments were performed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. A total of 37 studies were included, involving 275 pregnant women with COVID‐19 and 248 neonates. The majority of pregnant women presented with mild to moderate symptoms, only 10 were admitted in the ICU, and one died. Two stillbirths were reported and the incidence of prematurity was 28%. Sixteen neonates were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by RT‐PCR, and nine of them were born from mothers infected during pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes were generally good: all the affected neonates recovered. RT‐PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 yielded negative results on amniotic fluid, vaginal/cervical fluids, placenta tissue, and breast milk samples. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in pregnant women appeared associated with mild or moderate disease in most cases, with a low morbidity and mortality rate. The outcomes of neonates born from infected women were mainly favorable, although neonates at risk should be closely monitored. Further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of vertical transmission.","Trippella, Giulia; Ciarcià, Martina; Ferrari, Marta; Buzzatti, Chiara; Maccora, Ilaria; Azzari, Chiara; Dani, Carlo; Galli, Luisa; Chiappini, Elena",Pathogens,,388

METHODS: This study used a mixed-method approach. The first phase implemented a survey that targeted both academic staff and students to evaluate their experiences with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a focus group discussion was conducted to explore, in-depth, their experience. The survey consisted of five domains as follows: readiness for the shift to distance education during the full and partial lockdown, perception towards distance education, barriers against distance education, and the acquisitions due to distance education. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess participants' responses to the different domains (mean score ± standard deviation). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the academic staff and 65% of the students responded to the survey. Participants' views were positive for readiness for the shift to distance education during the full lockdown (3.89±0.42 for academic staff and 3.82±0.50 for students) with almost similar evaluation for the readiness during the blended learning period (3.91±0.44 for staff and 3.83±0.59 for students). The findings showed a generally positive perception towards distance education (3.59± 0.67 for academic staff and 3.47±0.64 for students). The acquisitions due to distance education were also positive (3.95±0.72 for academic staff and 3.78±0.77 for students). Nonetheless, some barriers that affected distance education were raised with an overall neutral view from both academic staff (3.31±0.72) and students (3.31±0.64), with different responses for the individual items. Qualitative findings from the focus group discussions explored the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges, with emphasis on the areas for improvement. CONCLUSION: Although the shift for distance education was out of a sudden, participants showed overall positive views about their experience with distance education and highlighted areas for improvement.","Altwaijry, N.; Ibrahim, A.; Binsuwaidan, R.; Alnajjar, L.

This requires the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus infection treatments. METHODS: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c)Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone - drugs used for SARS-CoV-2 - were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are made. RESULTS: The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with lopinavir/ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19 treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for use to ensure patient safety.","Plasencia-García, Beatriz Oda; Rico-Rangel, María Isabel; Rodríguez-Menéndez, Gonzalo; Rubio-García, Ana; Torelló-Iserte, Jaime; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto",Pharmacopsychiatry,,388

We assessed insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin secretion in patients with COVID-19 without diabetes on admission and at 3 and 6 months after discharge. METHODS: This 6-month prospective study assessed data from the records of 64 patients without diabetes diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital, China. Each patient was followed up at 3 and 6 months after discharge. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate differences in multiple measurements of the same variable at different times. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the contributor for changes in the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. RESULTS: Fasting C-peptide levels in patients at baseline were lower than the normal range. Compared with the baseline results, patients had significantly elevated fasting C-peptide levels (0.35 ± 0.24 vs 2.36 ± 0.98 vs 2.52 ± 1.11 µg/L; P < .001), homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (0.42, interquartile range [IQR] 0.36-0.62 vs 2.54, IQR 1.95-3.42 vs 2.90, IQR 2.02-4.23; P < .001), and TyG indices (8.57 ± 0.47 vs 8.73 ± 0.60 vs 8.82 ± 0.62; P = .006) and decreased fasting glucose levels (5.84 ± 1.21 vs 4.95 ± 0.76 vs 5.40 ± 0.68 mmol/L; P = .003) at the 3- and 6-month follow-up. Male gender, age, interferon-alfa treatment during hospitalization, and changes in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein levels were significantly associated with changes in the TyG index. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the first evidence that COVID-19 may increase the risk of insulin resistance in patients without diabetes.","Chen, Mochuan; Zhu, Bing; Chen, Dong; Hu, Xingzhong; Xu, Xueqin; Shen, Wen-Jun; Hu, Chenchan; Li, Jue; Qu, Shen",Endocr. pract,,388

Since previous reports suggested that viral entry into cells may involve angiotensin converting enzyme 2, there has been growing concern that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use may exacerbate the disease severity. In this retrospective, single-center US study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included: ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, use of inotropes, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to account for potential confounders. Among 590 unmatched patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 78 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB (median age 63 years and 59.7% male) and 512 patients were non-users (median age 42 years and 47.1% male). In the propensity matched population, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with hospital admission (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.5-2.7, p = 0.652). CAD and CKD/ESRD remained independently associated with admission to hospital. All-cause mortality, ICU stay, need for ventilation, and inotrope use was not significantly different between the 2 study groups.

590547,Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic: impact on infants with pyloric stenosis,2020,"Coronaviruses have marked their significant emergence since the twenty-first century with the outbreaks of three out of the seven existing human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These viruses have not only acquired large-scale transmission during their specified outbreak period, but cases of MERS-CoV still remain active, although there is only limited transmission. While, on the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a rising threat to global public health. The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects—all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus’ differing deadly pattern.","Araf, Yusha; Faruqui, Nairita Ahsan; Anwar, Saeed; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir",Int Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10123-020-00152-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231780/,388

Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.","Park, Dae Hoon; Joe, Yun Haeng; Piri, Amin; An, Sanggwon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420306294?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389420306294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339873/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640,388

It also estimated its impact on gang and non-gang related shootings. METHODS: Weekly crime data are analyzed at the city level using ARIMA and poisson models. Forecasting is used to verify the validity of both ARIMA and poisson models. RESULTS: The effect of the pandemic was conditional upon the types of gun violence and impact models of intervention. The pandemic caused a temporary increase in fatal shootings while leading to a long-term increase in all non-fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings with injury, non-fatal shootings without injury, and gang related shootings. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed the volume of gun violence possibly due to increased strain and/or changed routine activities. This study not only promotes further research but also has policy implications for public health and safety.

594179,The use of bone conduction headsets to improve communication during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-08-14,"The process of transferring to online teaching during the pandemic COVID-19 lockdown has been a core issue for teachers around the globe. The main aim of this paper was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of emotional intelligence (EI) and general self-efficacy on the adaptability to online teaching (AOT). A multiple-mediation model was proposed, including the mediating effect via the teacher’s Facilitator role and teacher’s concrete experience learning mode (CE-LM), as defined in experiential learning theory (ELT). Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 330 preschool and primary school teachers (84 males, M(age) = 38.3, SD = 9.14). Path analysis was performed based on maximum likelihood estimation with the resampling method. Results: The findings showed that the proposed model fit the data well. A serial mediation path between EI and AOT via the teacher’s Facilitator role and CE-LM was obtained. In addition, CE-LM mediated the relationship between general self-efficacy and AOT. Conclusion: To date, this is the first study to analyse the direct and indirect effects of dispositional traits, such as EI and general self-efficacy, on AOT in the framework of Kolb’s ELT. Our results highlight the mediating mechanisms of this relationship, that is, the teacher’s Facilitator role and CE-LM.

594283,Agile response to the shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 crisis,2020-11-02,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Working Group “Prevention and Integrative Oncology” (PRIO) in the German Cancer Society has initiated flash interviews and surveys. One of these stated increasing rates of fears and mental stress of tumor patients. Now we aimed to analyze whether tumor patients did perceive changes in their attitudes and behaviors related to their relationships, awareness of nature and quietness, interest in spiritual issues, or feelings of worries and isolation. A further point of interest was how these perceived changes could be predicted, either by meaning in life, spirituality as a resource to cope, perceived fears and worries, or particularly by their wellbeing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online survey with standardized questionnaires (i.e., WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO5), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), Spiritual and Religious Attitudes to cope with illness (SpREUK-15), Gratitude/Awe scale (GrAw-7)) among 292 tumor patients (72% men; mean age 66.7 ± 10.8 years; 25% < 60 years, 33% 60-70 years, 41% > 70 years) from Germany between May 6 to June 10, 2020. RESULTS: Patients´ wellbeing (WHO5) scores were in the lower range (14.7 ± 6.0); 35% scored < 13, indicating depressive states. Wellbeing was significantly higher in older persons and lower in younger ones (F=11.1, p<.0001). Most were irritated by different statements about the danger and the course of the corona infection in the public media (60%), and 57% were worrying to be infected and to have a complicated course of disease. Because of the restrictions, patients noticed changes in their attitudes and behaviors (measured with the 12-item Perceptions of Change Scale): 1) Perception of nature and silence (Cronbach´s alpha = .82), 2) Worrying reflections and loneliness (Cronbach´s alpha = .80), 3) Interest in spirituality (Cronbach´s alpha = .91), 4) Intense relationships (Cronbach´s alpha = .64). These perceptions of change were similar in women and men, age groups and also with respect to tumor stages. Regression analyses revealed that the factor Perception of nature and silence was predicted best by patients´ ability to value and experience the ‘wonder’ of the present moment (in terms of wondering awe and gratitude) and by patients´ search for meaning in life. The factor Worrying reflections and loneliness was predicted best by their search for meaning in life and by feelings of being under pressure because of the Corona pandemic. Interest in spirituality was predicted best by search for an access to a spiritual source and by frequency of praying. Intense relationships were explained with weak predictive power by patients´ ability to reflect life concerns. Patients´ wellbeing during the Corona pandemic was predicted (R(2) =.57) by a mix of disease and pandemic related stressor, and by available resources (meaning in life and religious trust). CONCLUSION: In this study among tumor patients from a secular society the topics meaning in life, having (religious) trust, stable relationships, mindful encounter with nature, and times of reflection were found to be of importance. To overcome tumor patients´ feelings of isolation, depressive states, and insecurity about future perspectives, further support is needed, particularly in their socio-spatial surrounding. These are the domains of psychotherapy and spiritual care. The planned integration of structured access to spiritual care seems to be important, not only for the field of cancer care. As the findings refer to patients´ self-perceptions, longitudinal studies are required to substantiate these perceived changes.","Büssing, Arndt; Hübner, Jutta; Walter, Stefanie; Gießler, Wolfgang; Büntzel, Jens",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192703/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574314,388

In most cases, the etiology is unknown but may be associated with infections, systemic disorders, exposure to industrial toxins and environmental pollutants, or even drug toxicity. This report describes a 77-year-old male who presented to the hospital with nonproductive cough, myalgias, fever, and progressive weight loss after prolonged exposure to sodium hypochlorite. The patient was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics with no pathogen isolation. Chest CT revealed condensation foci of all pulmonary lobes. His clinical history, laboratory results, and CT images led to the diagnosis of OP, which was confirmed with a transbronchial lung biopsy. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone with clinical improvement and discharge one week after the beginning of the corticosteroid treatment. OP diagnosis can be challenging and, if not considered, may lead to a delay in providing appropriate treatment to the patients, which can often lead to a prolonged hospital stay and poor outcomes.","Santos, Inês; Lucas, Sandra; Seixas, Rui; Lino, Ireneia",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457128/,388

While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.","Sacksteder, Katherine A.; Jones, Jacob M.; South, Sarah T.; Li, Xiaoling; Liu, Yifei; Gould, Stephen J.",J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10704444/,388
597931,Personal Protective Equipment Preservation Strategies in the COVID-19 Era A Narrative Review,2021-05-08,"BACKGROUND: In many jurisdictions public health authorities have implemented travel restrictions to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. Previous research has considered the impact of international travel restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics, but in response to the pandemic, policies that restrict travel within countries have also been implemented, and the impact of these restrictions is less well studied. On May 4th, 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) implemented travel restrictions such that non-residents were required to have exemptions to enter the province. METHODS: We fit a stochastic epidemic model to data describing the number of active COVID-19 cases in NL from March 14th - May 4th. We then predicted possible outbreaks over the 9 weeks subsequent to May 4th, with and without the travel restrictions, and for physical distancing scenarios ranging from a 40% to 70% reduction in the daily contact rate relative to pre-pandemic levels. RESULTS: We find that the mean number of clinical COVID-19 cases would have been 12.4 times higher without the travel restrictions. Furthermore, without the travel restrictions there is a substantial risk of very large outbreaks. INTERPRETATION: Using epidemic modelling, we show how the NL COVID-19 outbreak could have unfolded had the travel restrictions not been implemented. Both physical distancing and travel restrictions affect the local dynamics of the epidemic. Our modelling shows that the travel restrictions are a plausible reason why there were so few reported COVID-19 cases in NL in the 9 weeks after May 4th.","Hurford, A.; Rahman, P.; Loredo-Osti, J.

597975,Obstructive Sleep Apnea as a comorbidity to Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unemployment is related to poverty and is a risk factor for poor health. The present study investigates if unemployment increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for men and women of working age in Germany. METHODS: The study uses the health insurance data from AOK Rhineland/Hamburg (from 1 January 2020 until 18 June 2020) of 1,288,745 persons aged between 18 and 65. Four employment situations are distinguished: (1) regular employment, (2) low-wage employment with social support, (3) unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 1, and (4) long-term unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 2. COVID-19 hospitalizations are measured on the basis of the ICD codes U07.1 and U07.2 reported by the hospitals. Multiple logistic regression models are calculated (adjusted for age and sex). RESULTS: During the observation period, 1521 persons had hospitalization with COVID-19 as primary or secondary diagnosis. Overall, this corresponds to a rate of 118 cases per 100,000 insured persons. Rates varied by employment situation. Compared with regularly employed persons, the odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.94 (CI 95%: 1.74–2.15) for long-term unemployment, 1.29 (0.86–1.94) for unemployed, and 1.33 (0.98–1.82) for low-wage employment. CONCLUSION: The results are in line with earlier studies from the USA and Great Britain reporting socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 hospitalization risk. This provides the first empirical support that socioeconomic inequalities in the severity of COVID-19 also exists in Germany.","Wahrendorf, Morten; Rupprecht, Christoph J.; Dortmann, Olga; Scheider, Maria; Dragano, Nico",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03280-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507323/,388

OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this research was to study the genetic characteristics of EV-D68 strains that were circulating in Italy identified during an outbreak of an EV-D68 infection that occurred in Italy during the period March-October 2016. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of the circulation of different types and subtypes of EV-D68 was performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from March 2016 through October 2016 in children admitted to the Emergency Room with respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Among 390 children, 22 (59.1% males; mean age 47 months) were found to be infected by EV-D68 and most of them were immunocompetent (72.7%). Pneumonia was diagnosed in 12 (54.5%) children. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region showed that all the strains identified in this study belonged to clade B3. Within B3 subclade, the Italian EV-D68 strains were most closely related to strains detected in Southern China in 2015 as well as to strains detected in US and the Netherlands in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that EV-D68 infections are a common cause of lower respiratory illness in pediatric age. The circulation of one EV-D68 lineage has been proven in Italy and in the European region during 2016. However, further studies are required to investigate whether some strains or lineages may possess a higher affinity for the lower airway or central nervous system.","Piralla, Antonio; Principi, Nicola; Ruggiero, Luca; Girello, Alessia; Giardina, Federica; De Sando, Elisabetta; Caimmi, Silvia; Bianchini, Sonia; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Lunghi, Giovanna; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218300052; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218300052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396353/,388
600470,The impact of racism on emergency health care workers,2021,"Vaccine delivery is one important aspect need to be strengthened within health systems. One of the main challenges in COVID 19 vaccine delivery is how to cover indigenous population in remote and isolated forests in South East Asia. Another issue in COVID 19 cold chain delivery is requirement for a carrier that can maintain the suitable storage temperature. Related to this condition, COVID 19 vaccine should be delivered using heavy vaccine cooler box and this demand delivery system equipped with heavy lift capacity. In here, this study proposes and assess the potential used of heavy lift UAV quadcopter to expand the COVID 19 vaccine delivery to indigenous people living in village that impeded by rugged terrain. The landscape and terrain analysis show that access to the villages was dominated by 15%-45% slopes and the available access is only 1.5 m width trail. To transport 500 vials with 10 kg carrier along 2 km trail, it requires 2 persons to walk for 1 hour. By using drone, a straight line route with a length of 1.5 km can be developed. There were at least 3 drone types were available commercially to lift 10 kg load and several drones with payload capacity below 10 kg. For carrying 100 vials to village using drones, it is estimated the required delivery time was 1.23-1.38 minutes. Around 1.57-1.66 minute delivery times were required to transport 250 vials. For carrying the maximum and full loads of 500 vials or equals to 10 kg load, a drone requires in average of 3.13 minute delivery times. This required drone delivery time is significantly below the required time by walking that almost 1 hour. Drones were limited by flight operational times. Whereas all required delivery times for each drone assessed in this study were still below the drone operational time. The lowest drone operational time was 16 minutes and this is still higher than the time required for a drone to deliver the vaccine.

600539,"Effect of continual quality improvement of palliative care consultation teams by iterative, customer satisfaction survey-driven evaluation",2021-03-19,"COVID-19 placed a special role on fiscal policy in rescuing companies short of liquidity from insolvency. In the first months of the crisis, SMEs as the backbone of Germany’s economy benefited from large and mainly indiscriminate aid measures. Avoiding business failures in a whatever-it-takes fashion contrasts, however, with the cleansing mechanism of economic crises: a mechanism which forces unviable firms out of the market, thereby reallocating resources efficiently. By focusing on firms’ pre-crisis financial standing, we estimate the extent to which the policy response induced an insolvency gap and analyze whether the gap is characterized by firms which were already struggling before the pandemic. With the policy measures being focused on smaller firms, we also examine whether this insolvency gap differs with respect to firm size. Our results show that the COVID-19 policy response in Germany has triggered a backlog of insolvencies that is particularly pronounced among financially weak, small firms, having potential long-term implications on entrepreneurship and economic recovery. Plain English Summary This study analyzes the extent to which the strong policy support to companies in the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis has prevented a large wave of corporate insolvencies. Using data of about 1.5 million German companies, it is shown that it was mainly smaller firms that experienced strong financial distress and would have gone bankrupt without policy assistance. In times of crises, insolvencies usually allow for a reallocation of employees and capital to more efficient firms. However, the analysis reveals that this ‘cleansing effect’ is hampered in the current crisis as the largely indiscriminate granting of liquidity subsidies and the temporary suspension of the duty to file for insolvency have caused an insolvency gap that is driven by firms which were already in a weak financial position before the crisis. Overall, the insolvency gap is estimated to affect around 25,000 companies, a substantial number compared to the around 16,300 actual insolvencies in 2020. In the ongoing crisis, policy makers should prefer instruments favoring entrepreneurs who respond innovatively to the pandemic instead of prolonging the survival of near-insolvent firms.","Dörr, Julian Oliver; Licht, Georg; Murmann, Simona",Small Bus Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11187-021-00514-4,388

METHODS: Microsimulation models were created in R using a synthetic sample based on primary data from 63 subjects enrolled in a pilot study of a smartphone application (App), Diabetes Pal compared to a nurse-based telemedicine strategy (Nurse). For comparability, the SMART and an RCT design were constructed to allow comparison of four (embedded) adaptive interventions (AIs). RESULTS: In the base case scenario, the SMART has similar overall mean expected HbA1c and cost per subject compared with RCT, for sample size of n = 100 over 10,000 simulations. SMART has lower (better) standard deviations of the mean expected HbA1c per AI, and higher efficiency of choosing the correct AI across various sample sizes. The differences between SMART and RCT become apparent as sample size decreases. For both trial designs, the threshold value at which a subject was deemed to have been responsive at an intermediate point in the trial had an optimal choice (i.e., the sensitivity curve had a U-shape). SMART design dominates the RCT, in the overall mean HbA1c (lower value) when the threshold value is close to optimal.

603355,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated stay at home order on emergency department super utilizers,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Otitis media (OM) is amongst the most common childhood diseases and is associated with multiple microbial pathogens within the middle ear. Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. METHODS: A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. RESULTS: This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the predominant otopathogens associated with OM as identified through bacterial culture; however, molecular methods continue to improve the frequency and accuracy of detection of individual serotypes. Ongoing monitoring with appropriate detection methods for OM pathogens can support development of improved vaccines to provide protection from the complex combination of otopathogens within the middle ear, ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of chronic and recurrent OM in vulnerable populations.","Ngo, Chinh C.; Massa, Helen M.; Thornton, Ruth B.; Cripps, Allan W.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26953891/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150949,388

We aim to estimate COVID-19 transmission to determine if the disease is successfully controlled or extra measured should be adopted to attain this goal. The daily incidence data of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia from March 2(nd), 2020, to April 4(th), 2021, were obtained from the continuously updated Saudi Ministry of Health COVID-19 repository. To get accurate estimation of the situation over the last 4 months (from December 1(st), 2020, to April 4(th), 2021), we calculated the weekly (every 7 days) R starting from March 2(nd), 2020, and till the last week of the available data. The calculated values of R were represented as median, first quantile (Q1), and third quantile (Q3). As early as the first week of December 2020, the median R was 0.81 (0.80–0.83) which means that each existing infected case would transmit infection to only one person. This was followed by fluctuations over the next few weeks around R value of 1, reaching its highest level of 1.45 (1.42–1.47) between December 31(st), 2020, and January 6(th), 2021. This was followed by a relatively steady decline over the following weeks, with some till mid-March where the R values started to slightly rise again. Social distancing, protective precautions, avoiding abuse of the partial lifting, expanding the screening process, and other Saudi measures sound to be successful and should be replicated in similar communities. This measure should be continued till the vaccination process is completed, to reduce the number of contacts and to avoid uncontrolled transmission of the disease.","Alkahtani, Theeb Ayedh; Alakeel, Abdullah; Alakeel, Reem Abdullah; Khorshid, Faten Abdulrahman; Alshammari, Hisham Hamoud; Alguwaihes, Abdullah M.; Almohideb, Mohammad; Ali, Eman Merghani; Bin-Jumah, May; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M.; Jammah, Anwar Ali",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244941/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14217-6,388

Forty‐one participants entered the study from September 2019 to March 2020 (pre‐COVID) and 59 after physical distancing was introduced due to COVID pandemic (during COVID). Online assessments were conducted at baseline and 1‐week follow up. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in weight concerns, disordered eating, and negative affect among participants entering the trial during COVID compared to pre‐COVID. The increases in the first two variables remained when adjusting for baseline negative affect. No significant interactions between time, condition and COVID status were observed. DISCUSSION: Young women experienced increased levels of disordered eating after the onset of COVID. While no interactions with COVID were detected, changes to within‐group effect sizes for disordered eating more than doubled for both online interventions and assessment from pre‐COVID to during COVID, suggesting any attention to issues related to disordered eating in the context of reduced social contact may be beneficial.","Zhou, Yuan; Wade, Tracey D.",Int J Eat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851442/,388

Of the 3590 diagnostic samples from Austrian dogs (≤2 years old), 8.7% contained Isospora oocysts, 78% of which from dogs up to 4 months of age. Non‐haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic diarrhoea were significantly more prevalent in Isospora‐infected animals than in coccidia‐negative ones. Twelve of 15 litters from a large commercial dog breeding unit (examined from the third to the 10th week of life) also excreted Isospora (average prevalence: 36.4%) in intensities from 333 to 35 000 oocysts per gram of faeces (opg). In experimental trials 26 3‐week‐old Beagle puppies were infected with low (600–6000), medium (10 000) or high (20 000) dose of Isospora ohioensis‐group or Isospora canis field isolates. Additionally 21 puppies were infected as above and treated with a symmetrical triazintrione. Parasitological and clinical parameters were examined. The two Isospora species differed significantly concerning intensity and duration of excretion. The pre‐patent period was 6–7 days for I. ohioensis and 10–12 days for I. canis. The latter species showed significantly longer excretion and higher opg. This was not influenced by simultaneous infections with both species. Individual patterns of faecal consistency were very variable, irrespective of the infection dose. Treatment significantly reduced both the intensity and the duration of oocysts excretion as well as diarrhoea in comparison with the infected, untreated group and thus proved to be effective against coccidiosis in experimental infections.","Buehl, I.

606728,Family-Centered Care During the COVID-19 Era,2020-04-22,"As the worldwide vaccination, it is imperative to minimize vaccine wastage by effectively using all doses available. Vaccine wastage can occur at multiple points during the vaccination process, but it is mainly because the device dead space and the filling process technique. However, there are no studies discussing the waste volume effect of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical practice. There is an increasing COVID-19 vaccine demand that we estimate up to several billion dual doses. The objective of this study was to assess the number of 0.3mL doses obtained from a multiple-dose vial using 1ml and 3ml syringes with different type of needles replicating the first COVID-19 vaccination protocol. Our results suggest that it is possible to obtain six or seven doses from each vial instead five. We provide evidence to optimize between 20% and 40% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 5-dose vials are used, making scarce supplies go further. It is our duty, as researchers, to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the worldwide COVID-19 vaccination process. However, if standard syringes-needles and technique are used, there may not be sufficient volume to draw extra doses from a single vial.","P Jara, C.; Velloso, L.; Pereira de araujo, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.21249167; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249167v1?rss=1,388

Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems vaccinology approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses of 56 healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). Vaccination resulted in the robust production of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (derived from 2019-nCOV/USA_WA1/2020) and, to a lesser extent, the B.1.351 strain, as well as significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. Booster vaccination stimulated a notably enhanced innate immune response as compared to primary vaccination, evidenced by (1) a greater frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes; (2) a higher concentration of plasma IFNÎ³; and (3) a transcriptional signature of innate antiviral immunity. Consistent with these observations, our single-cell transcriptomics analysis demonstrated an approximately 100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cell cluster enriched in interferon-response transcription factors and reduced in AP-1 transcription factors, after secondary immunization. Finally, we identified distinct innate pathways associated with CD8 T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and show that a monocyte-related signature correlates with the neutralizing antibody response against the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccination and demonstrate its capacity to prime the innate immune system to mount a more potent response after booster immunization.","Arunachalam, Prabhu S; Scott, Madeleine K D; Hagan, Thomas; Li, Chunfeng; Feng, Yupeng; Wimmers, Florian; Grigoryan, Lilit; Trisal, Meera; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Lai, Lilin; Chang, Sarah Esther; Feng, Allan; Dhingra, Shaurya; Shah, Mihir; Lee, Alexandra S; Chinthrajah, Sharon; Sindher, Sayantani B; Mallajosyula, Vamsee; Gao, Fei; Sigal, Natalia; Kowli, Sangeeta; Gupta, Sheena; Pellegrini, Kathryn; Tharp, Gregory; Maysel-Auslender, Sofia; Hamilton, Sydney; Aoued, Hadj; Hrusovsky, Kevin; Roskey, Mark; Bosinger, Steven E; Maecker, Holden T; Boyd, Scott D; Davis, Mark M; Utz, Paul J; Suthar, Mehul S; Khatri, Purvesh; Nadeau, Kari C; Pulendran, Bali",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252919/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03791-x,388

HIV can be classified into two types, HIV-type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-type 2 (HIV-2), with HIV-1 being the most common type worldwide. Seventy-six million people have been infected since the start of the pandemic, with a mortality rate of 33 million. Even after 40 years, no cure has been developed for this pandemic. The development of the mRNA vaccine has led to further research for the utilization of mRNA vaccine in HIV, in attempts to create a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Although messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has been around for many years, it has recently drawn attention due to its role and response in the unforeseen coronavirus pandemic. mRNA vaccine has faced its fair-share of challenges, but it also offers many advantages compared to conventional vaccines such as safety, efficacy, rapid preparation, and versatility. mRNA vaccine has shown promising results and has great potential. In this review, we discuss the types of mRNA vaccine, along with development, delivery, advantages, challenges, and how we are working to overcome these challenges.","Khalid, Khizer; Padda, Jaskamal; Khedr, Anwar; Ismail, Dina; Zubair, Ujala; Al-Ewaidat, Ola A; Padda, Sandeep; Cooper, Ayden Charlene; Jean-Charles, Gutteridge",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367800/,388
608187,Three-Tiered COVID-19 Cohorting Strategy and Implications for Memory Care,2020-09-06,"The crisis generated by the emergence and pandemic spread of COVID‐19 has thrown into the global spotlight the dangers associated with novel diseases, as well as the key role of animals, especially wild animals, as potential sources of pathogens to humans. There is a widespread demand for a new relationship with wild and domestic animals, including suggested bans on hunting, wildlife trade, wet markets or consumption of wild animals. However, such policies risk ignoring essential elements of the problem as well as alienating and increasing hardship for local communities across the world, and might be unachievable at scale. There is thus a need for a more complex package of policy and practical responses. We undertook a solution scan to identify and collate 161 possible options for reducing the risks of further epidemic disease transmission from animals to humans, including potential further SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (original or variants). We include all categories of animals in our responses (i.e. wildlife, captive, unmanaged/feral and domestic livestock and pets) and focus on pathogens (especially viruses) that, once transmitted from animals to humans, could acquire epidemic potential through high rates of human‐to‐human transmission. This excludes measures to prevent well‐known zoonotic diseases, such as rabies, that cannot readily transmit between humans. We focused solutions on societal measures, excluding the development of vaccines and other preventive therapeutic medicine and veterinary medicine options that are discussed elsewhere. We derived our solutions through reading the scientific literature, NGO position papers, and industry guidelines, collating our own experiences, and consulting experts in different fields. Herein, we review the major zoonotic transmission pathways and present an extensive list of options. The potential solutions are organised according to the key stages of the trade chain and encompass solutions that can be applied at the local, regional and international scales. This is a set of options targeted at practitioners and policy makers to encourage careful examination of possible courses of action, validating their impact and documenting outcomes.","Petrovan, Silviu O.; Aldridge, David C.; Bartlett, Harriet; Bladon, Andrew J.; Booth, Hollie; Broad, Steven; Broom, Donald M.; Burgess, Neil D.; Cleaveland, Sarah; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Ferri, Maurizio; Hinsley, Amy; Hua, Fangyuan; Hughes, Alice C.; Jones, Kate; Kelly, Moira; Mayes, George; Radakovic, Milorad; Ugwu, Chinedu A.; Uddin, Nasir; Veríssimo, Diogo; Walzer, Christian; White, Thomas B.; Wood, James L.; Sutherland, William J.",Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231315/,388

To identify the biomarker of diagnosis for LUAD is of great significance. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were previously revealed to exert vital effects in numerous cancers. LncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 520 (LINC00520) served as an oncogene in various cancers. Therefore, our study was specially designed to probe the role of LINC00520 in LUAD. RESULTS: LINC00520 expression was detected by RT-qPCR. Next, function of LINC00520 in LUAD was verified by in vitro loss-of-function experiments. DNA pull down, ChIP, RIP, and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to reveal the regulatory mechanism of LINC00520. We found that LINC00520 was upregulated in LUAD. Additionally, LINC00520 upregulation is associated with the poor prognosis for patients with LUAD. Furthermore, LINC00520 downregulation suppressed LUAD cell proliferation and migration and induced cell apoptosis. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is identified as the transcription factor to transcriptionally activate LINC00520. Moreover, LINC00520 positively upregulated FOXP3 expression via sponging miR-3611 in LUAD cells. Subsequently, rescue experiments delineated that miR-3611 downregulation or FOXP3 overexpression reversed the effects of silenced LINC00520 on proliferative and migratory capabilities in LUAD cells. CONCLUSION: This study innovatively indicated that lncRNA LINC00520 facilitated cell proliferative and migratory abilities in LUAD through interacting with miR-3611 and targeting FOXP3, which may provide a potential novel insight for treatment of LUAD.

Data was collected through a phone survey from May to July 2017 (N = 1510). Participants were English-speaking evacuees aged 18 and older. Mental health services utilization and barriers to mental health care were assessed with the Perceived Need for Care questionnaire. Probable diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and insomnia were assessed with validated self-report questionnaires. Multiple logistic regressions confirmed that gender was a significant predictor of services utilization, after controlling for associated sociodemographic variables and presence of probable diagnoses. Women were respectively 1.50, 1.55 and 1.86 times more likely than men to receive information, medication and psychological help. Self-reliance was the most frequently reported reason for not receiving help, and motivational barriers, such as pessimism and stigma, were reported in a higher proportion than structural barriers, including nonresponse and finance. No significant gender differences were found in the types of perceived barriers to services. Among the Fort McMurray fire evacuees, mental health services utilization was similar to other studies on natural disaster victims, and higher in women than in men. Efforts to increase services utilization in natural disaster victims should focus on motivational barriers and offering treatments fostering people’s autonomy, such as online treatments.

611521,Patient Characteristics Associated with Telemedicine Use at a Large Academic Health System Before and After COVID-19,2021-01-27,"Background: Over 50 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally as of November 2020. Evidence is rapidly emerging on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and its impact on individuals and potential burden on health services and society. Between 10–35% of people with COVID-19 may experience post-acute long Covid. This currently equates to between 8,129 and 28,453 people in Scotland. Some of these people will require rehabilitation to support their recovery. Currently, we do not know how to optimally configure community rehabilitation services for people with long Covid. Methods: This national survey aimed to provide a detailed description of current community rehabilitation provision for people with long Covid in Scotland. We developed, piloted, and conducted a national electronic survey of current community rehabilitation service provision for people presenting with long Covid symptomatology. Our sample were the Allied Health Professions Directors of all 14 territorial NHS Health Boards in Scotland. Fixed response and narrative data were analysed descriptively. Results: Responses were received from all respondents (14/14), enabling a national picture to be gained. Almost all Health Boards (13/14) currently deliver rehabilitation for people with long Covid within pre-existing services. Fatigue (11/14) and respiratory conditions (9/14) were the two most common presenting problems of patients. Most long Covid community rehabilitation services are delivered through a combination of face-to-face and digital contact (13/14). Conclusions: Community rehabilitation for people with long Covid is an emerging reality. This survey provides a national picture of current community rehabilitation for people with long Covid. We do not know how community rehabilitation can be optimally delivered for this population. This is vital as community rehabilitation services were already under pressure prior to the emergence of COVID-19. Further research is urgently required to investigate the implementation, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of differing models of community rehabilitation for this patient population.","Duncan, Edward; Cooper, Kay; Cowie, Julie; Alexander, Lyndsay; Morris, Jacqui; Preston, Jenny",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953912/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27894.2,388

The clinical characteristics vary from asymptomatic to fatal. This study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) levels and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study included 147 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were categorized into 4 groups by BMI levels on admission: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5–22.9 (normal weight), 23.0–24.9 (overweight), and ≥25.0 kg/m(2) (obese). Rates of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ICU stay during hospitalization across BMI group was determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between BMI and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the totals, patients having a BMI <18.5, 18.5–22.9, 23.0–24.9, and ≥25.0 kg/m(2) were 12.9%, 38.1%, 17.7%, and 31.3%, respectively. The rates of pneumonia and severe pneumonia tended to be higher in patients with higher BMI, whereas the rates of AKI and ICU stay were higher in patients with BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) and ≥ 25 kg/m(2), when compared to patients with normal BMI. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia in the logistic regression analysis, having a BMI ≥25.0 kg/m(2) was associated with higher risk of severe pneumonia (OR 4.73; 95% CI, 1.50–14.94; p = 0.003) compared to having a BMI 18.5–22.9 kg/m(2). During admission, elevated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels on day 7 and 14 of illness were associated with higher BMI levels. In contrast, rising of serum creatinine levels was observed in underweight patients on days 12 and 14 of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in patients with COVID-19 was associated with severe pneumonia and adverse outcomes such as AKI, transaminitis and ICU stay. Underweight patients should be closely monitored for AKI. Further studies in body composition are warranted to explore the links between adiposity and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Jayanama, Kulapong; Srichatrapimuk, Sirawat; Thammavaranucupt, Kanin; Kirdlarp, Suppachok; Suppadungsuk, Supawadee; Wongsinin, Thananya; Nanthatanti, Nithita; Phusanti, Sithakom; Pitidhammabhorn, Dhanesh; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592042/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247023,388

Specifically, to examine the relative contribution of different resilience levels in decreasing nursing students' strain symptoms: at the individual level, resilience trait; at the relational level, students' coping strategies; at the university level, nursing students' perceptions on their university's readiness to handle the virus outbreak; and at the national level, nursing students' trust in policymakers' decisions. DESIGN: The study used a cross‐sectional design. METHODS: Undergraduate students of five universities were recruited via an electronic link sent to their emails during the first months of the COVID‐19 outbreak: May–July 2020. Of them, 492 participants completed the research questionnaire. RESULTS: Hierarchical Regression Analysis revealed that nursing students' resilience, as a multi‐level factor, decreased the students' level of strain symptoms above and beyond their stress levels and control variables. Specifically, the nursing students' trait resilience, perceptions of their university's positive response to the pandemic and trust in their national policymakers were negatively associated with their strain symptoms. Conversely, disengagement‐in‐emotion coping strategies was positively associated with the students' strain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students' resilience should be seen as a flexible resource that can be developed and influenced by their academic and clinical training, and by the intentions and actions of their university and the nursing administration at the Ministry of Health (MOH). IMPACT: The findings call for the nursing administration at the MOH and for the university deans and department heads to prepare in advance a crisis plan that could be rapidly and effectively implemented when needed. Furthermore, topics such as developing flexible coping strategies should be integrated into the nursing curricula.

Self-compassion (SC) interventions emphasize not only treating oneself in a caring way regarding personal weaknesses, e.g., diet lapses, but also the recognition of shared human suffering. Thus, self-compassion might be particularly valuable during the current worldwide crisis due to COVID-19. In this study, N = 65 participants that wanted to lose weight or develop a healthier eating behavior were randomized to either a 14-day self-compassion intervention arm or a waitlist control arm. The intervention consisted of daily journaling exercises and meditations via smartphone with a focus on improving eating behavior. Before and after the intervention phase, questionnaires on self-compassion, eating, dieting, health behavior, stress, and emotion regulation were completed and body weight was determined. Participants in the treatment arm (n = 28) showed an increase in self-compassion, a decrease in perceived stress, eating in response to feeling anxious, and, on trend level, body mass index (BMI). Changes in self-compassion fully mediated changes in stress. No such effects were found in the waitlist control group (n = 29). Thus, self-compassion might help to maintain well-being and healthy eating habits in times of increased stress and isolation. Future studies should replicate these findings outside of the COVID-19 crisis and test the effect of self-compassion in samples with eating disorders or weight problems.","Schnepper, Rebekka; Reichenberger, Julia; Blechert, Jens",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.595806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162922/,388

We showed that the bacteria circulating in the blood of camels is dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, Sediminibacterium, Hydrotalea, Bradyrhizobium and Anaplasma were the most abundant taxa. Eukaryotic profile was dominated by Fungi, Charophyta and Apicomplexa. At the genus level, Theileria was detected in 10 out of 18 samples, while Sarcocystis, Hoplorhynchus and Stylocephalus were detected in one sample each. Our metagenomic approach was successful in the detection of several pathogens or potential pathogens including Anaplasma sp., Theileria ovis, Th. separata, Th. annulate, Th. mutans-like and uncharacterized Theileria sp.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of personal protective equipment on physiological parameters during CPR. A randomized, quasi-experimental, crossover design was used. The study was carried out in a training and simulation emergency box and the total sample consisted of 20 healthcare professionals. Two CPR tests were compared with the recommended sequence of 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations. The duration of each test was 20 min. One of the CPR tests was carried out without using any PPE (CPR_control), i.e., performed with the usual clothing of each rescuer. The other test was carried out using a CPR test with PPE (i.e., CPR_PPE). The main variables of interest were: CPR quality, compressions, ventilations, maximum heart rate, body fluid loss, body temperature, perceived exertion index, comfort, thermal sensation and sweating. The quality of the CPR was similar in both tests. The maximum heart rate was higher in the active intervals (compressions + bag-valve-mask) of the test with PPE. CPR_PPE meant an increase in the perceived effort, temperature at the start of the thermal sensation test, thermal comfort and sweating, as opposed to CPR performed with usual clothing. Performing prolonged resuscitation with PPE did not influence CPR quality, but caused significant physiological demands. Rescuers were more fatigued, sweated more and their thermal comfort was worse.

We tested the independent association of COVID-19 with AKI. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, observational, cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to one of six hospitals within the Yale-New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 8/31/2020 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal PCR test. EXPOSURE: Positive test for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME: AKI by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. ANALYTIC APPROACH: Evaluated the association of COVID-19 with AKI after controlling for time-invariant factors at admission (e.g., demographics, comorbidities) and time-varying factors updated continuously during hospitalization (e.g., vital signs, medications, laboratory results, respiratory failure) using time-updated Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Of the 22,122 patients hospitalized between, 2,600 tested positive and 19,522 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had more AKI [30.6% vs. 18.2%, absolute risk difference 12.5 (95% CI, 10.6, 14.3)%] and dialysis-requiring AKI (8.5% vs. 3.6%) and lower recovery from AKI (58% vs. 69.8%]. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had higher inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin), and greater use of vasopressors and diuretics. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had higher rate of AKI in univariable analysis (HR, 1.84 [1.73, 1.95]). In fully adjusted model controlling for demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results, COVID-19 remained associated with a high rate of AKI (adjusted HR, 1.40 [1.29-1.53]). LIMITATIONS: Possibility of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of AKI not fully explained by adjustment for known risk factors. This suggests the presence of mechanisms of AKI not accounted for in this analysis, which may include a direct effect of COVID-19 on the kidney or other unmeasured mediators. Future studies should evaluate the possible unique pathways by which COVID-19 may cause AKI.","Moledina, Dennis G.; Simonov, Michael; Yamamoto, Yu; Alausa, Jameel; Arora, Tanima; Biswas, Aditya; Cantley, Lloyd G.; Ghazi, Lama; Greenberg, Jason H.; Hinchcliff, Monique; Huang, Chenxi; Mansour, Sherry G.; Martin, Melissa; Peixoto, Aldo; Schulz, Wade; Subair, Labeebah; Testani, Jeffrey M.; Ugwuowo, Ugochukwu; Young, Patrick; Wilson, F.

Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of COVID-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of ‘black swan’ type shocks.","Arndt, Channing; Davies, Rob; Gabriel, Sherwin; Harris, Laurence; Makrelov, Konstantin; Robinson, Sherman; Levy, Stephanie; Simbanegavi, Witness; van Seventer, Dirk; Anderson, Lillian",Glob Food Sec,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221191242030064X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100410; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221191242030064X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834955/,388

We examined the role of GX-sPLA2 during H1N1 pandemic influenza infection in a GX-sPLA2 gene targeted mouse (GX−/−) model and found that survival after infection was significantly greater in GX−/− mice than in GX+/+ mice. Downstream products of GX-sPLA2 activity, PGD2, PGE2, LTB4, cysteinyl leukotrienes and Lipoxin A4 were significantly lower in GX−/− mice BAL fluid. Lung microarray analysis identified an earlier and more robust induction of T and B cell associated genes in GX−/− mice. Based on the central role of sPLA2 enzymes as key initiators of inflammatory processes, we propose that activation of GX-sPLA2 during H1N1pdm infection is an early step of pulmonary inflammation and its inhibition increases adaptive immunity and improves survival. Our findings suggest that GX-sPLA2 may be a potential therapeutic target during influenza.","Kelvin, Alyson A.; Degousee, Norbert; Banner, David; Stefanski, Eva; Leόn, Alberto J.; Angoulvant, Denis; Paquette, Stéphane G.; Huang, Stephen S.H.; Danesh, Ali; Robbins, Clinton S.; Noyan, Hossein; Husain, Mansoor; Lambeau, Gerard; Gelb, Michael; Kelvin, David J.; Rubin, Barry B.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214000439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725934/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214000439,388

Calcidiol (25OHD), as precursor of calcitriol, derives, for the most part (80%), from cutaneous cholesterol (7-dehydrocholesterol) under the action of UV-B (sunlight). Consequently, serum concentrations fluctuate during the year following the circannual rhythm of sun exposition. We will update about the available evidence regarding the complex influence of seasonal vitamin D changes on two different chronic connective tissue diseases, namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Notably, RA is an emblematic model of autoimmune disease with prevalent joint inflammatory features, while SSc is mainly an autoimmune progressive pro-fibrotic disease. However, in both conditions, low serum concentrations of 25OHD are involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases, and emerging data report their impact on clinical manifestations.","Cutolo, Maurizio; Soldano, Stefano; Sulli, Alberto; Smith, Vanessa; Gotelli, Emanuele",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.683665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267753/,388
621803,COVID-19 and Asian American Pacific Islanders,2020-06-12,"Hyperlipidemia, the hallmark of Metabolic Syndrome that afflicts millions of people worldwide, exacerbates life-threatening infections. We present a new evidence for the mechanism of hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to microbial inflammation caused by pathogen-derived inducer, LPS. We demonstrate that hyperlipidemic animals succumbed to a non-lethal dose of LPS whereas normolipidemic controls survived. Strikingly, survival of hyperlipidemic animals was restored when the nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs), Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), and Carbohydrate-Responsive Element-Binding Proteins (ChREBPs) was impeded by targeting the nuclear transport checkpoint with cell-penetrating, biselective nuclear transport modifier (NTM) peptide. Furthermore, the burst of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, microvascular endothelial injury in the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys, and trafficking of inflammatory cells were also suppressed. To dissect the role of nuclear transport signaling pathways we designed and developed importin-selective NTM peptides. Selective targeting of the importin α5, ferrying SRTFs and ChREBPs, protected 70–100% hyperlipidemic animals. Targeting importin β1, that transports SREBPs, was only effective after 3-week treatment that lowered blood triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and averted fatty liver. Thus, the mechanism of hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to lethal microbial inflammation depends on metabolic and proinflammatory transcription factors mobilization, which can be counteracted by targeting the nuclear transport checkpoint.","Liu, Yan; Zienkiewicz, Jozef; Boyd, Kelli L.; Smith, Taylor E.; Xu, Zhi-Qi; Hawiger, Jacek",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099795/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91395-w,388

Experimental results reveal that the NVP-GMA adhesive not only significantly facilitates the chemical bonding between cellulose fibers in the wet state, but also increase the surface wettability and water retention. The as-fabricated cellulose-based wet wipe substrate displays a superb water retention capacity of 1.9 times, an excellent water absorption capacity (completely wetted with 0° water contact angle), and a perfect wet tensile index of 3.32 N.m.g(−1).

We urgently need answers to basic epidemiological questions regarding COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and newborns. While many national registries, health facilities, and research groups are collecting relevant data, we need a collaborative and methodologically appropriate approach to utilize these data to generate answers.

625753,Racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 disease burden & mortality among emergency department patients in a safety net health system,2020-09-24,"PURPOSE: It is unclear how and to what extent various infection prevention and control (IPC) policies affect the spread of an epidemic during work resumption. In order to assess the impact of IPC policies, this research addresses the results of a policy simulation in Shanghai, China, which estimates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 under various IPC policies and offers evidence-based outcomes of work resumption policies for the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This simulation research is based on a system dynamics (SD) model that integrates IPC work resumption policies implemented in Shanghai into the classical susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemiological model. Input data were obtained from official websites, the Baidu migration index and published literature. The SD model was validated by comparing results with real-world data. RESULTS: The simulations show that a non-quarantined and non-staged approach to work resumption (Policy 1) would bring a small secondary outbreak of COVID-19. The quarantined but non-staged approach (Policy 2) and the non-quarantined but staged approach (Policy 3) would not bring a secondary outbreak of COVID-19. However, they both would generate more newly confirmed cases than the staged and quarantined approach (Policy 4). Moreover, the 14-day quarantine policy alone appears to be more effective in reducing transmission risk than the staged work resumption policy alone. The combined staged and quarantined IPC policy led to the fewest confirmed cases caused by work resumption in Shanghai, and the spread of COVID-19 stopped (ie, the number of newly confirmed cases reduced to zero) at the earliest date. CONCLUSION: Conservative IPC policies can prevent a second outbreak of COVID-19 during work resumption. The dynamic systems model designed in this study can serve as a tool to test various IPC work resumption policies, facilitating decision-making in responses to combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Jidi; Jia, Jianguo; Qian, Ying; Zhong, Lumin; Wang, Jiancong; Cai, Yuyang",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116976/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s265992,388

This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease.

All three assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from 500-1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values >37 on the Fusion assay. In conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA.

Now more than ever, at a time when some governments are taking populations out of lockdown and youth are returning to schools, children around the world need to fully grasp the modes of transmission of the disease, the health risks, the scientific notions of the immune system, the value of barrier measures, and the progress of scientific research. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, comics can be very useful for communicating quickly and effectively abstract and important information to children who might be under the influence of a large amount of sometimes contradictory information. Conveying precise, reliable, and accessible information to children is key in a world overwhelmingly impacted by the outbreak. This should be the role and the responsibility of world health official leaders and governments in compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In partnership with mainstream medias, consortia of scientists, communication experts, and education specialists, it is urgent that world leaders engage children in this worldwide public health fight.","Ghia, Jean-Eric; Gaulin, Sophie; Ghia, Laure; Garancher, Laure; Flamand, Claude",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147222/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008828,388
628637,Decline and Rebound in Routine Cancer Screening Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-19,"Optimising public health physical distancing measures has been a critical part of the global response to the spread of COVID-19. Evidence collected during the current pandemic shows that the transmission rate of the virus is significantly reduced following implementation of intensive physical distancing measures. Adherence to these recommendations has been poorer than adherence to other key transmission reduction behaviours such as handwashing. There are a complex range of reasons that are likely to predict why people do not or only partially adhere to physical distancing recommendations. In the current project we aim to address the following research questions: (1) What are the psychosocial determinants of physical distancing for the general public and for key socio-demographic sub-groups (e.g., young adults, older adults, etc.)?; (2) Do current Government of Ireland COVID-19 physical distancing communications address the determinants of physical distancing?; and (3) How can communications be optimised and tailored to sub-groups to ensure maximum adherence to guidelines? These will be addressed by conducting three work packages (WPs). In WP1, we will work closely with the iCARE international study, which includes a large online survey of public responses to measures established to reduce and slow the spread of COVID-19, including physical distancing. We will analyse Irish data, comparing it to data from other countries, to identify the key psychosocial determinants of physical distancing behaviour. This will be followed by a qualitative study to explore in depth the barriers and facilitators of physical distancing behaviour among the Irish public (WP2). In WP3, we will conduct a content analysis and evidence mapping of current government messaging around physical distancing, to ensure the findings from this research feed into the development of ongoing communication and future messaging about physical distancing.","Durand, Hannah; Bacon, Simon L.; Byrne, Molly; Kenny, Eanna; Lavoie, Kim L.; McGuire, Brian E.; Mc Sharry, Jenny; Meade, Oonagh; Mooney, Robert; Noone, Chris; O'Connor, Laura L.; O'Flaherty, Kate; Molloy, Gerard J.",HRB Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490860/; https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13090.2,388

Understanding viral dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 is critical for development of effective treatments. An Immune‐Viral Dynamics Model (IVDM) is developed to describe SARS‐CoV‐2 viral dynamics and COVID‐19 disease progression. A dataset of 60 individual patients with COVID‐19 with clinical viral load (VL) and reported disease severity were assembled from literature. Viral infection and replication mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2, viral‐induced cell death, and time‐dependent immune response are incorporated in the model to describe the dynamics of viruses and immune response. Disease severity are tested as a covariate to model parameters. The IVDM was fitted to the data and parameters were estimated using the nonlinear mixed‐effect model. The model can adequately describe individual viral dynamics profiles, with disease severity identified as a covariate on infected cell death rate. The modeling suggested that it takes about 32.6 days to reach 50% of maximum cell‐based immunity. Simulations based on virtual populations suggested a typical mild case reaches VL limit of detection (LOD) by 13 days with no treatment, a moderate case by 17 days, and a severe case by 41 days. Simulations were used to explore hypothetical treatments with different initiation time, disease severity, and drug effects to demonstrate the usefulness of such modeling in informing decisions. Overall, the IVDM modeling and simulation platform enables simulations for viral dynamics and treatment efficacy and can be used to aid in clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose‐efficacy response analysis for COVID‐19 drug development.","Cao, Youfang; Gao, Wei; Caro, Luzelena; Stone, Julie A.",Clin Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121337/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13099,388

Fortunately, most infected individuals recover and are then resistant to re-infection for a period, indicating that a vaccination approach can be successful. Elucidation of rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection within select regions across the United States of America (USA) will help direct vaccination efforts and together will inform our approach towards achieving herd immunity. Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August to December 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days of this time frame, versus a significant increase to 9.24% in the last 58 days, and a final rate of 12.86% in December 2020. Approximately 56% of Spike seropositive individuals also had immunoreactivity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the Spike protein, which is associated with viral neutralization. Males and females in the Cincinnati area showed nearly identical rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians were not significantly different. Interestingly, donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed that the West side of Cincinnati had a rate of 9.63% versus 8.13% on the East side (demarcated by Interstate-75), while the adjoining area of Kentucky was 7.04% (as demarcated by the Ohio River). These results among healthy blood donors will be critical in calculating the time needed to achieve regional herd immunity in conjunction with the national vaccination campaign.","Davis, G.; York, A.

632210,Clinical Suspicion of COVID-19 in Nursing Home residents: symptoms and mortality risk factors,2020-10-28,"On February 27, 2020, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) identified its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with probable community transmission (i.e., infection among persons without a known exposure by travel or close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19). At the time the investigation began, testing guidance recommended focusing on persons with clinical findings of lower respiratory illness and travel to an affected area or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, or on persons hospitalized for severe respiratory disease and no alternative diagnosis (1). To rapidly understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community, SCCPHD, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and CDC began sentinel surveillance in Santa Clara County. During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites. For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers. A convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza virus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza. Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection. This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2). Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19.","Zwald, Marissa L.; Lin, Wen; Sondermeyer Cooksey, Gail L.; Weiss, Charles; Suarez, Angela; Fischer, Marc; Bonin, Brandon J.; Jain, Seema; Langley, Gayle E.; Park, Benjamin J.; Moulia, Danielle; Benedict, Rory; Nguyen, Nang; Han, George S.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271724/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e3,388

Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back containment measures. The aims of this study were to investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; and to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples, respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled. Pooling is a viable strategy for high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-prevalence settings.","Chong, Brian S.W.; Tran, Thomas; Druce, Julian; Ballard, Susan A.; Simpson, Julie A.; Catton, Mike",Pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036772/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031302520309326?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pathol.2020.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031302520309326,388

These variables were used to predict COVID-19 preventive health behaviors (PPE use), psychological distress, and physical symptoms. The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A demographically diverse sample of participants was recruited. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation.Participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. PPE mask wearing was variable: 16% “not at all,” 20% “some of the time,” 42% “a good part of the time,” and 26 “most of the time.” Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. Physical symptom reporting was also high. Intolerance of uncertainty and psychological inflexibility were significant predictors of psychological distress and physical symptoms. Psychological flexibility moderated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms. The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress/physical symptoms was stronger among participants with lower levels of psychological flexibility. These findings indicate psychological flexibility can reduce distress associated with COVID-19.

A mixed-method study of projected palliative care need and recommendations for service delivery,2021-02-03,"Since Myers (1915) coined the term ‘shell shock’ to define the prolonged suffering of soldiers returning from the Great War, the psychological and physical result of distressing experiences, known as trauma, has been of academic interest. Transgenerational transmission of trauma effects has been recorded, demonstrating that on some level, the exposure to trauma of one generation can impact individuals of a subsequent generation (Yehuda & Lehrner, 2018). Observational studies on children of holocaust survivors formed the basis of this trajectory of research (Rakoff, 1966), and eventually this phenomenon became referred to as the transgenerational transmission of trauma (TTT). Since then, TTT has been observed in several contexts, including within families who have experienced high rates historical trauma (O’Neill et al., 2016), within regions high-frequencies of historical war and terrorism (Yehuda & Lehrner, 2018) and those who have undergone famine (Ahmed, 2010). This report aims to outline several pathways (biological, psychological, and sociological) by which trauma may be transmitted across generations. Moreover, it discusses several methods of trauma assessment and the related challenges and benefits. Lastly, this report advocates a biopsychosocial approach – an interdisciplinary model using the interplay of biological, psychological, and social-environmental factors – to research TTT. By promoting the benefits of such an interdisciplinary approach we attempt to break up silos between disciplines and encourage collaboration between academics from various backgrounds researching this topic to better serve individuals impacted by TTT.","Afifah Ridhuan, Suria; Caltabiano, Anna; Gillis, Harry; Giritlioğlu, Ali; Graff, Anna; Hampikian, L.

We want to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exposure could trigger a humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) through molecular mimicry and assess its relationship to patient prognosis. Methods: Anti-Spike domain 1 (SD1) IgGs, anti-apoA-1 IgGs and against mimic peptides, as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case-control (n=101), an intensive care unit (ICU;n=126) with a 28-days follow-up, and a general population cohort (n=663) with available samples in the pre and post-pandemic period. Results: Linear sequence homologies and antibodies cross-reactivity between apoA-1, TLR2, and Spike epitopes were identified. Overall, anti-apoA-1 IgG levels were higher in COVID-19 patients or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals (p<0.0001). Significant and similar associations were noted between anti-apoA-1, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, cytokines, and lipid profile. In ICU patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-apoA-1 seroconversion rates displayed similar 7-days kinetics, reaching 82% for anti-apoA-1 seropositivity. C-statistics (CS) indicated that anti-Spike/TLR2 mimic-peptide IgGs displayed a significant prognostic accuracy for overall mortality at 28 days (CS: 0.64;p=0.02). In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased baseline anti-apoA-1 IgG levels. Conclusions: COVID-19 induces a marked humoral response against the major protein of high-density lipoproteins. As a correlate of poorer prognosis in other clinical settings, such autoimmunity signatures may relate to long-term COVID-19 prognosis assessment and warrant further scrutiny in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Pagano, S.; Yery, S.; Meyer, B.; Juillard, C.; Suh, N.; Le Terrier, C.; Daguer, J.-P.; Lluc, F.-S.; Barluenga, S.; Piumatti, G.; Hartley, O.; Lemaitre, B.; Eberhardt, C.

The survey was distributed to the leaders of stroke centers in these 280 hospitals. RESULTS—: From the data of Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China, the total number of thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped 26.7% (P<0.0001) and 25.3% (P<0.0001), respectively, in February 2020 as compared with February 2019. We retrieved 227 valid complete datasets from the 280 stroke centers. Nearly 50% of these hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19. The capacity for stroke care was reduced in the majority of the hospitals. Most of the stroke centers stopped or reduced their efforts in stroke education for the public. Hospital admissions related to stroke dropped ≈40%; thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped ≈25%, which is similar to the results from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China as compared with the same period in 2019. Many factors contributed to the reduced admissions and prehospital delays; lack of stroke knowledge and proper transportation were significant limiting factors. Patients not coming to the hospital for fear of virus infection was also a likely key factor. CONCLUSIONS—: The COVID-19 outbreak impacted stroke care significantly in China, including prehospital and in-hospital care, resulting in a significant drop in admissions, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. Although many factors contributed, patients not coming to the hospital was probably the major limiting factor. Recommendations based on the data are provided.","Zhao, Jing; Li, Hang; Kung, David; Fisher, Marc; Shen, Ying; Liu, Renyu",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432997/; https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030225,388

The data is sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database over the period of 1990–2016, covering 21 developed and developing countries with high carbon emissions. The study uses dynamic panel data estimations by applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) and system-generalized methods of moments (Sys-GMM) over sample countries. The results indicate that FDI has a significant positive impact on environmental degradation. There is evidence of pollution haven hypotheses, especially in developing countries. We contribute to existing literature by revisiting the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and presenting the effect of FDI on carbon intensity in the light of institutional factors and financial development. The findings relating to FDI, institutional factors and financial development may cause researchers and policymakers to reiterate the sustainability dimension of foreign capital inflows in both developed and developing countries. We propose the policy framework to include a mandatory Statement of Environmental Disclosures for both listed and unlisted home and host companies at the time of their origin, expansion and fund raising in order to achieve sustainable business goals (SBGs).","Singhania, Monica; Saini, Neha",J Bus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296320306573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100429/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.10.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296320306573,388

Here, a comparative analysis of the membrane permeabilization capacity of a number of viroporins was performed in baby hamster kidney cells. Synthesis of 6K protein from Sindbis virus, E from mouse hepatitis virus, M2 from influenza A virus, and 2B and 3A from poliovirus enhanced membrane permeability to different extents. We show that two proteins from hepatitis C virus, p7 and NS4A, also display viroporin activity to a level comparable to 6K protein. In addition to their capacity to disrupt ionic cellular homeostasis and promote bacterial cell lysis, the expressed viroporins were able to induce cell death. Degradation of internucleosomal DNA and generation of apoptotic bodies were observed upon viroporin expression. Consistently, cleavage of translation initiation factor 4GI and poly‐(ADP‐ribose) polymerase indicated activation of effector caspase‐3. We found that poliovirus 2B localizes partially in mitochondria and induces an anomalous perinuclear distribution of these organelles. Mitochondria morphology was also altered after expression of other viroporins. Finally, detection of cytochrome c release from mitochondria suggests involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in viroporin‐induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that viroporins induce caspase‐dependent programmed cell death.","Madan, Vanessa; Castelló, Alfredo; Carrasco, Luis",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17961183/,388
648726,Job stress among workers who telecommute during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan: a cross-sectional study,2021-03-22,"Background In Finland, both mRNA and adenovirus vector (AdV) Covid-19 vaccines have been used after the vaccination campaign started on December 27, 2020. Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world setting. Methods During the first 5 months of the campaign, a register-based cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 16-69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalization was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in the unvaccinated. Results The cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36-53%) and 40% (26-51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalization was 63% (49-74%) and 82% (56-93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32-50) and 62% (42-75%) against infection and hospitalization, respectively. One week after the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65-82%) and 77% (65-85%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalization was 93% (70-98%) and 90% (29-99%). Conclusions Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalization. A single dose provides moderate protection in elderly and chronically ill, although 2 doses are clearly superior.","Baum, U.; Poukka, E. J.; Palmu, A.; Salo, H.; Lehtonen, T.

649294,Comparison of Direct-to-Consumer Telemedicine Visits With Primary Care Visits,2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31×10(9)/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29×10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48×10(9)/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39×10(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Michael Henry, Brandon",Clin Chim Acta,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32178975/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301248; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301248,388
649801,PPE-conserving chest X-ray setting during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-29,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as banning public events or instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated with indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.","Castillo-Laborde, Carla; de Wolff, Taco; Gajardo, Pedro; Lecaros, Rodrigo; Olivar-Tost, Gerard; Ramírez C., Héctor",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564787/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-021-01669-0,388
650127,Outbreak of Human Metapneumovirus in a Nursing Home: A Clinical Perspective,2019-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Parasites that infect cats include protozoa, helminths and arthropods, many of which are transmissible to humans. Effective control relies on a good knowledge of parasite distribution and the risk factors for infection. The present study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of major feline parasites in Italy and the risk factors associated with their occurrence. METHODS: Over a 12-month study period, feces, hair and ectoparasites from naturally infected cats from feral colonies, shelters and private households were analyzed at 13 study centers across Italy. Samples from these cats (n = 987) were analyzed at all centers using the same diagnostic methods. Prevalence values and risk factors were evaluated statistically for the identification of predictors of risk. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of gastro-intestinal and broncho-pulmonary (BP) nematodes was 35.9% (354/987). Toxocara cati was the most prevalent species (253/987; 25.6%), followed by Ancylostomatidae (98/987; 9.9%). Among BP nematodes, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the most common (76/987; 7.7%). Approximately 35.7% (352/987) of the study population was infested by ectoparasites, of which the most common were fleas (29.4%, 290/987), followed by ear mites Otodectes cynotis (9.8%, 97/987). Predictors of risk for parasite infection included age, a predominantly or exclusively outdoor lifestyle, geographic area and lack of antiparasitic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both ecto- and endoparasites are still common in cats throughout Italy, many of them being of zoonotic concern and vectors of pathogens to humans. Given the presence of parasites throughout the entire study period, year-round treatment should be considered. Furthermore, data confirm the need to protect the human–animal bond using proper endo- and ectoparasiticides to reduce the risk of human infection, in application of the One-Health concept.

The magnitude of exposure risk to COVID-19 infections in Ethiopia is rapidly increasing following its spread in the country. However, studies about the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers and factors associated with risk of COVID-19 infection are lacking in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: The study investigated level of risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors among healthcare workers at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2020 to determine risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. In total, 318 healthcare workers participated in the study. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. A binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers. RESULTS: A total of 243 (76%) healthcare workers had a high exposure risk of COVID-19 infection. Department of healthcare workers, ICU department workers [AOR: 6.545, 95% CI; (1.79–23.97)], long working hours [AOR: 9.224, 95% CI; (2.00–42.61)], inadequate supply of PPE [AOR: 0.318, 95% CI; (0.14–0.75)], lack of access to alcohol-based hand rub [AOR: 0.093, 95% CI; (0.01–0.98)], providing care within one meter of COVID-19 patients [AOR: 20.633, 95% CI; (3.88–109.76)], and direct contact with an environment in which a COVID-19 patient received care [AOR: 9.600, 95% CI; (1.05–84.50)] were found to be risk factors for COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers face a high risk of COVID-19 infection while providing care for COVID-19 patients. Proper use and adequate supply of PPE and the implementation of basic infection prevention and control with frequent protocol revision and strict supervision are crucial to limit exposure risk to COVID-19 among healthcare workers.","Hussen, Hawi; Alemu, Zewdie Aderaw",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994805/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s301518,388

As a result, new forms of contestation are emerging that reveal social inequalities at the heart of community-led responses to climate change. This paper uses four tenets of energy justice – distributional, procedural, restorative and recognition justice – to critically analyse and understand the politics and geography of local renewable energy deployment in Bristol, England. Focusing on the development of two solar PV farms in and around Lawrence Weston, an area of high deprivation in North West Bristol, the paper demonstrates the critical nature of instances of both energy justice and injustice in a time of austerity. Using primary data obtained via a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach in Bristol during 2015–2017, the paper draws on participant observation data and in-depth interviews (n = 10) with a variety of local energy actors and community members active in Lawrence Weston. The primary data details the extent to which spatial configurations of new low-carbon energy infrastructures are integral to their justice implications. Indeed, it is the proximity of projects both close to and within the Lawrence Weston community that shapes the participant’s thoughts and deliberations on how to achieve local energy justice, through appeal to the four tenets outlined. The findings emphasise the distributional justice impacts of creating new low-carbon energy infrastructures in deprived communities in a time of austerity, whilst also noting that ‘opening up’ local energy transitions to greater input from local communities’ offers opportunities to achieve procedural justice. Shifting relationships between local energy actors and Lawrence Weston highlight opportunities for the remediation of past claims of injustice, facilitating processes of restorative justice, whilst local energy schemes that seek to advance greater ‘active participant’ (skills training & employment) opportunities for deprived communities in which they, or their projects, are embedded, may be underpinned by recognition justice concerns. This ‘active participant’ approach is shown to be key to advancing beyond ‘passive recipient’ approaches to community energy transitions and enhancing spatial equity. Finally, the paper offers novel empirical insights into the contested role of geography, space and place in local transitions and contributes to bottom-up perspectives on issues of spatial (in)justice in community energy schemes.","Lacey-Barnacle, Max",Energy Res Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864343/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620302887; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214629620302887; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101713,388

652128,"The challenges of caring for people dying from COVID-19: a multinational, observational study (CovPall)",2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: No trials have tested multifaceted mental health interventions recommended by public health organisations during COVID-19. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program on anxiety symptoms and other mental health outcomes among people vulnerable during COVID-19 owing to a pre-existing medical condition. METHODS: The SPIN-CHAT Trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or waitlist). Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6–10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete. FINDINGS: Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86). Mean age was 55·0 years (SD 11·4 years), 162 (94%) were women, and 136 (79%) identified as White. In intention-to-treat analyses, the intervention did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms post-intervention (−1·57 points, 95% CI −3·59 to 0·45; standardised mean difference [SMD] −0·22 points) but reduced symptoms 6 weeks later (−2·36 points, 95% CI −4·56 to −0·16; SMD −0·31). Depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks post-intervention (−1·64 points, 95% CI −2·91 to −0·37; SMD −0·31); no other secondary outcomes were significant. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The intervention did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms or other mental health outcomes post-intervention. However, anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks later, potentially capturing the time it took for new skills and social support between intervention participants to affect mental health. Multi-faceted interventions such as SPIN-CHAT have potential to address mental health needs in vulnerable groups during COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains about effectiveness.

We evaluate whether this is the case in COVID-19 patients. Objective To determine whether there is an association between hypothermia and worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit. Methods Retrospective study of a cohort of patients (n = 57) admitted to the intensive care unit of a community hospital with a positive test for COVID-19. Measurements Data relating to mortality, comorbidities and length of stay was recorded from electronic medical records for each patient. Hypothermia was defined as ≥2 recorded body temperatures of less than 96.5℉ (35.83℃) at the time of admission. Main results Of the 57 patients enrolled in the study, 21 developed hypothermia during their stay and 36 did not. Our results show that patients who have hypothermia at the time of admission spend a longer time intubated (p < 0.01) and go through longer ICU stays (p < 0.01). These patients are also 2.18 times more likely to suffer a fatal outcome compared to patients that did not develop hypothermia while in the intensive care unit (Chi-squared = 8.6209, p < 0.01, RR = 2.18). Conclusions Hypothermia in patients with severe COVID-19 at the time of admission to the ICU is associated with poorer outcomes for patients. This manifests as a longer period of intubation, longer ICU stay, and increased risk of mortality.","Maait, Yousef; El Khoury, Marc; McKinley, Lee; El Khoury, Anthony",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007774/,388
658638,The Things They Carry: Veterans and the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-07-28,"In this work, Isatis tinctoria hairy root cultures (ITHRCs) were established as an alternative source for flavonoids (FL) production. I. tinctoria hairy root line V was found to be the most efficient line and was further confirmed by the PCR amplification of rolB, rolC and aux1 genes. Culture parameters of ITHRCs were optimized by Box-Behnken design (BBD), and eight bioactive FL constituents (rutin, neohesperidin, buddleoside, liquiritigenin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol and isoliquiritigenin) were quali-quantitatively determined by LC-MS/MS. Under optimal conditions, the total FL accumulation of ITHRCs (24 day-old) achieved was 438.10 μg/g dry weight (DW), which exhibited significant superiority as against that of 2 year-old field grown roots (341.73 μg/g DW). Additionally, in vitro antioxidant assays demonstrated that ITHRCs extracts exhibited better antioxidant activities with lower IC(50) values (0.41 and 0.39, mg/mL) as compared to those of field grown roots (0.56 and 0.48, mg/mL).

659120,COVID-19 and Nursing Home Residents’ Rights,2020-07-29,"Early detection and diagnosis are critical factors to control the COVID-19 spreading. A number of deep learning-based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis. These approaches, however, suffer from at least one of the following problems: (i) they treat each CT scan slice independently and (ii) the methods are trained and tested with sets of images from the same dataset. Treating the slices independently means that the same patient may appear in the training and test sets at the same time which may produce misleading results. It also raises the question of whether the scans from the same patient should be evaluated as a group or not. Moreover, using a single dataset raises concerns about the generalization of the methods. Different datasets tend to present images of varying quality which may come from different types of CT machines reflecting the conditions of the countries and cities from where they come from. In order to address these two problems, in this work, we propose an Efficient Deep Learning Technique for the screening of COVID-19 with a voting-based approach. In this approach, the images from a given patient are classified as group in a voting system. The approach is tested in the two biggest datasets of COVID-19 CT analysis with a patient-based split. A cross dataset study is also presented to assess the robustness of the models in a more realistic scenario in which data comes from different distributions. The cross-dataset analysis has shown that the generalization power of deep learning models is far from acceptable for the task since accuracy drops from 87.68% to 56.16% on the best evaluation scenario. These results highlighted that the methods that aim at COVID-19 detection in CT-images have to improve significantly to be considered as a clinical option and larger and more diverse datasets are needed to evaluate the methods in a realistic scenario.","Silva, Pedro; Luz, Eduardo; Silva, Guilherme; Moreira, Gladston; Silva, Rodrigo; Lucio, Diego; Menotti, David",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820305773?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914820305773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953971/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100427,388

We claim that humorous effect in jokes and other discourse is often created by the juxtaposition of topoi evoked. A prerequisite for this is that there is a shift where the interpreter of the discourse updates their information state with regard to a second topos being evoked. This view of humour is consistent with an incremental analysis of dialogue, and we therefore argue that interaction is central both for humour creation and interpretation. We point out some different ways in which topoi are juxtaposed in humorous dialogues as well as in jokes published in social media or in joke books, and take jokes from the coronavirus pandemic as an example because this makes lots of new topoi available and therefore offers the opportunity of creating novel jokes based on the juxtaposition of the new and existing topoi. We explore how the mechanisms of inference in dialogue can be applied to humour through the four elements from our title: old (existing), new (not previously existing), borrowed (associated with a different situation) and taboo (inappropriate in the context).","Maraev, Vladislav; Breitholtz, Ellen; Howes, Christine; Larsson, Staffan; Cooper, Robin",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054658/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.654615,388

METHODS: This retrospective observational study conducted from April 1, 2020, to February 18, 2021, included 97 adult patients who required mechanical ventilation for severe COVID‐19 pneumonia and excluded nonintubated patients with a positive COVID‐19 polymerase chain reaction test and those who had any obvious bacterial infection on admission. All patients were followed up to discharge or death. We obtained clinical information and laboratory data including levels of presepsin, interleukin‐6, procalcitonin, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) antibody every day. Poor outcome was defined as death or receiving a tracheostomy during hospitalization, and favorable outcome was defined as discharge after extubation. RESULTS: Differences (median [interquartile range]) were detected in age (76 [70–82] versus 66 [55–74] years), day from the onset of first symptoms to admission for mechanical ventilation (5 [3–7] versus 10 [8–12] days), and P/F ratio (i.e., ratio of arterial oxygen concentration to the fraction of inspired oxygen) after intubation (186 [149–251] versus 236 [180–296]) in patients with poor outcome versus those with favorable outcome on admission. Serum SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody levels had already increased on admission in patients with favorable outcome. We determined the day from the onset of first symptoms to admission for mechanical ventilation to be one of the independent prognostic factors of patients with COVID‐19 (adjusted odds ratio 0.69, confidence interval 0.56–0.85). CONCLUSION: These results may contribute to understanding the mechanism of progression in severe COVID‐19 and may be helpful in devising an effective therapeutic strategy.","Domi, Hisaya; Matsuura, Hiroshi; Kuroda, Maiko; Yoshida, Motoharu; Yamamura, Hitoshi",Acute Med Surg,https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277014/,388

Despite this, a significant proportion of the US tobacco control and prevention field continues to be guided by a precept that there is “no safe tobacco,” therefore failing to acknowledge practices that may be used to reduce the harms associated with consuming combustible forms of nicotine and tobacco. In this commentary, we argue that ignoring the potential benefits of harm reduction strategies may unintentionally lead to an erosion of trust in tobacco control among some members of the public. Trust in tobacco control as an institution is crucial for the success of tobacco control efforts. To ensure trust, we must return to our basic principles of doing no harm, developing programs that are responsive to people’s experiences, and providing resources in assisting people to reduce the harms that may be associated with practices, such as smoking, which adversely affect health. Only by respecting an individual’s priorities can we cultivate trust and develop tobacco prevention efforts that are grounded in the realities of people’s lives and responsive to their needs.","Antin, Tamar M.

This study aims to test the hypothesis that Mg treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2. RESEARCH METHODS & PROCEDURES: This study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT), a double-blind 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RESULTS: We found that 12-week of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-mC methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those aged < 65 years old. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex and baseline methylation as well as FDR correction (FDR-adjusted P =0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hmC level at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and 5′UTR, promoter) by 2.3% compared to increases by 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those aged < 65 years old (P=0.003). The effect remained significant at FDR of 0.10 (adjusted P value=0.088). CONCLUSION: Among individuals aged younger than 65 years with the Ca:Mg intake ratios equal to or over 2.6, reducing Ca:Mg ratios to around 2.3 increased 5-mC modifications (i.e. cg16371860) and reduced 5-hmC modifications (i.e. cg26337277) in the TMPRSS2 gene. These findings, if confirmed, provide another mechanism for the role of Mg intervention for the prevention of COVID-19 and treatment of early and mild disease by modifying the phenotype of the TMPRSS2 genotype.","Fan, Lei; Zhu, Xiangzhu; Zheng, Yinan; Zhang, Wei; Seidner, Douglas L; Ness, Reid; Murff, Harvey J; Yu, Chang; Huang, Xiang; Shrubsole, Martha J; Hou, Lifang; Dai, Qi",Nutrition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900721002021?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116393/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900721002021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.111340,388

The increasing prevalence of obesity makes it a major healthcare challenge across both developed and developing countries. Traditional measures such as body mass index do not always identify individuals at increased risk of comorbidities, yet continue to be used in deciding who qualifies for weight loss treatment. A better understanding of how obesity is associated with comorbidities, in particular non-metabolic conditions, is needed to identify individuals at risk in order to prioritize treatment. For metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), weight loss can prevent T2D in individuals with prediabetes. It can improve and reverse T2D if weight loss is achieved early in the course of the disease. However, access to effective weight loss treatments is a significant barrier to improved health for people with obesity. In the present paper, we review the rising prevalence of obesity and why it should be classed as a multisystem disease. We will discuss potential mechanisms underlying its association with various comorbidities and how these respond to treatment, with a particular focus on cardiometabolic disease, malignancy and mental health.","Sarma, Shohinee; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Dash, Satya",Diabetes Obes Metab,https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621415/,388

In severe P. aeruginosa infections, the phospholipase activity of the type 3 secretion system toxin, ExoU, induces lysis of target host cells and results in the poorest clinical outcomes. We have developed an integrated pipeline to evaluate small molecule inhibitors of ExoU in vitro and in cultured cell models, including a disease-relevant corneal epithelial (HCE-T) scratch and infection model using florescence microscopy and cell viability assays. Compounds Pseudolipasin A, compound A and compound B were effective in vitro inhibitors of ExoU and mitigated P. aeruginosa ExoU-dependent cytotoxicity after infection of HCE-T cells at concentrations as low as 0.5 µM. Addition of the antimicrobial moxifloxacin controlled bacterial load, allowing these assays to be extended from 6 h to 24 h. P. aeruginosa remained cytotoxic to HCE-T cells with moxifloxacin, present at the minimal inhibitory concentration for 24 h, but, when used in combination with either Pseudolipasin A, compound A or compound B, a greater amount of viable cells and scratch healing were observed. Thus, our pipeline provides evidence that ExoU inhibitors could be used in combination with certain antimicrobials as a novel means to treat infections due to ExoU producing P. aeruginosa, as well as the means to identify more potent ExoU inhibitors for future therapeutics.","Foulkes, Daniel M.; McLean, Keri; Zheng, Yalin; Sarsby, Joscelyn; Haneef, Atikah S.; Fernig, David G.; Winstanley, Craig; Berry, Neil; Kaye, Stephen B.",Biochem J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459338/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20200780,388

It is possible to increase research validity in relation to the above problems by the following means: (1) Conducting a longitudinal study on the same participants and only on them; (2) Trying to shorten the time period between laboratory experiments and those on humans, based on cost–benefit considerations, anchored in ethical norms; (3) Reporting the theoretical background in a causal modular format; (4) Giving incentives to those who meet the above criteria while moderating the pressure for fast output.","Klein, Joseph",Qual Quant,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-021-01196-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257468/,388

Since there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and sent to the study participants through social media plat-forms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Key determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Of the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey. RESULTS: Of the 992 respondents, 642 showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups, being married participants with education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), employed in government sector (68.9%).

Clinical biomarkers characterizing patients who are likely to experience these prolonged effects are unknown. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study to compare longitudinal lab test measurements (hemoglobin, hematocrit, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen) in patients rehospitalized after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 clearance (n=104) versus patients not rehospitalized after viral clearance (n=278). FindingsCompared to patients who were not rehospitalized after PCR-confirmed viral clearance, those who were rehospitalized had lower median hemoglobin levels in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (cohens D = -0.50; p=1.2x10-3) and during the active infection window (cohens D = -0.71; p=4.6x10-8). Patients hospitalized after viral clearance were also more likely to be diagnosed with moderate or severe anemia during the active infection window (OR = 2.18; p = 4.99x10-9). ConclusionsThe occurrence of moderate or severe anemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is strongly associated with rehospitalization after viral clearance.

METHODS: We used Google Trends, a publicly available database, to access search query data in a systematic and quantitative fashion to search for CAC-related key terms. Search terms included calcium test, heart score, calcium score, coronary calcium, and calcium test score. We accessed Google Trends in January 2021 and analyzed data from 2004 to 2020. RESULTS: From 2004 to December 31, 2020, CAC-related search interest (in relative search volume) increased continually worldwide (+201.9%) and in the United States (+354.8%). Three main events strongly influenced search interest in CAC: reports of a CAC scan of the president of the United States led to a transient 10-fold increase in early January 2018. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline release led to a sustained increase, and lockdown after the global pandemic due to COVID-19 led to a transient decrease. Real-world data on performed CAC scans showed an increase between 2006 and 2017 (+200.0%); during the same time period, relative search volume for CAC-related search terms increased in a similar pattern (+70.6%-1511.1%). For the search term coronary calcium scan near me, a potential representative of active online search for CAC scanning, we found a +28.8% increase in 2020 compared with 2017. CONCLUSION: Google Trends, a valuable tool for assessing public interest in health-related topics, suggests increased overall interest in CAC during the last 17 years that mirrors real-world usage data. Increased interest is seemingly linked to reports of CAC testing in world leaders and endorsement in major guidelines.","Dzaye, Omar; Berning, Philipp; Adelhoefer, Siegfried; Duebgen, Matthias; Blankstein, Ron; Mahesh, Mahadevappa; Nasir, Khurram; Blumenthal, Roger S.; Mortensen, Martin Bødtker; Blaha, Michael J.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997641/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2021.02.010,388

Using interviews, ethnographic data, and policy documents, this paper will delineate and analyze the dimensions of sense of place, which, in this case, prompted policy changes dramatically different from standard relocation policies: assurance that the properties and land from which residents are departing will remain in their possession as long as the land remains. For most Island residents, this was non-negotiable. The intangible connection to place—feelings of belonging, lifestyle, family connections, and culture—plays a central role in many families’ decision to stay or go. The choice to relocate is rooted in this complex entanglement of identity, familial ties, land loss, historical and current marginalization, and a way of life passed on by multiple generations. In forthcoming community resettlements, continued access and ownership of the properties being left behind should be considered as a critical component for planning just retreats.","Simms, Jessica R.

675452,The challenge of mental health during Covid-19 outbreak: experience from metropolitan area of Milan,2020-06-20,"Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it has been clear that testing large groups of the population was the key to stem infection and prevent the effects of the coronavirus disease of 2019, mostly among sensitive patients. On the other hand, time and cost-sustainability of virus detection by molecular analysis such as reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) may be a major issue if testing is extended to large communities, mainly asymptomatic large communities. In this context, sample-pooling and test grouping could offer an effective solution. Here we report the screening on 1195 oral-nasopharyngeal swabs collected from students and staff of the Università degli Studi del Sannio (University of Sannio, Benevento, Campania, Italy) and analyzed by an in-house developed multiplex RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection through a simple monodimensional sample pooling strategy. Overall, 400 distinct pools were generated and, within 24 h after swab collection, five positive samples were identified. Out of them, four were confirmed by using a commercially available kit suitable for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD). High accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were also determined by comparing our results with a reference IVD assay for all deconvoluted samples. Overall, we conducted 463 analyses instead of 1195, reducing testing resources by more than 60% without lengthening diagnosis time and without significant losses in sensitivity, suggesting that our strategy was successful in recognizing positive cases in a community of asymptomatic individuals with minor requirements of reagents and time when compared to normal testing procedures.","Polvere, Immacolata; Silvestri, Elena; Sabatino, Lina; Giacco, Antonia; Iervolino, Stefania; Peluso, Teresa; Guida, Rosa; Zerillo, Lucrezia; Varricchio, Romualdo; D’Andrea, Silvia; Voccola, Serena; Madera, Jessica Raffaella; Zullo, Alberto; Stilo, Romania; Vito, Pasquale; Zotti, Tiziana",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206932/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11071166,388

We compared laboratory and clinical findings in children with comparable age distribution and hospitalized due to RSV, HMPV or RV infections. Viral pathogens were detected by a quantitative real time PCR from nasopharyngeal aspirates. No significant differences in the admission diagnosis, laboratory parameters, patient demographics and treatment measures between the three viral causes of respiratory illness were found. No correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed however, there was a significantly lower concentration of the nasopharyngeal interleukin 8 (IL‐8) in children with RV compared to HMPV and RSV, indicating a milder proinflammatory reaction. Moreover, RV‐infected children had significantly lower body temperature, higher leucocyte counts in peripheral blood, and a tendency to have a shorter stay in hospital than children with either HMPV or RSV infection. Taken together, clinical presentation of the infections with RSV, HMPV, and RV is similar among children of the same age group and not clearly distinguishable by standard clinical or laboratory findings. Therefore, virus specific testing should be included regularly for routine diagnosis of children with respiratory tract infections. J. Med.

Meanwhile, marked infection rate differences were reported between populations and individuals. To understand the disease dynamic, we developed a computational approach to study the implications of both SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations and ACE2 polymorphism on the stability of the virus-receptor complex. We used the 6LZG PDB RBD/ACE2 3D model, the mCSM platform, the LigPlot+ and PyMol software to analyze the data on SARS-CoV-2 mutations and ACE variants retrieved from GISAID and Ensembl/GnomAD repository. We observed that out of 351 RBD point mutations, 83% destabilizes the complex according to free energy (ΔΔG) differences. We also spotted variations in the patterns of polar and hydrophobic interactions between the mutations occurring in 15 out of 18 contact residues. Similarly, comparison of the effect on the complex stability of different ACE2 variants showed that the pattern of molecular interactions and the complex stability varies also according to ACE2 polymorphism. We infer that it is important to consider both ACE2 variants and circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations to assess the stability of the virus-receptor association and evaluate infectivity. This approach might offers a good molecular ground to mitigate the virus spreading.","Ashoor, Dana; Khalaf, Noureddine Ben; Marzouq, Maryam; Al Jarjanazi, Hamdi; Chelif, Sadok; Fathallah, M.

In China, the risk government is of so-called nationwide catastrophe response mode which is different from the widely adopted “bottom up” risk governance mode in the Western countries. Such a particular mode may make Chinese people perceive risk in a different way from people in other countries. Hence, a further discussion of risk perception is of great value in China. ﻿This paper presents a case study on the public perception of flood hazard and flood risk in a city prone to floods. The relationship between risk perception and exposure was examined by spatial analysis. Meanwhile, inferential testing with chi-squared tests was undertaken regarding experience, social trust, and protective behaviors. Our results suggest that (1) the relationship between exposure and risk perception of people in Nanjing is positive and statistically significant, (2) flood experience was strongly related to risk perception, (3) trust showed a significant relationship to risk perception, and (4) people who have perceived the probability of floods and associated loss of life have a higher willingness to take more protective measures. These findings will help local government to develop effective flood risk communication strategies for improving public awareness creation, emergency response and preparedness.","Ge, Yi; Yang, Guangfei; Wang, Xiaotao; Dou, Wen; Lu, Xueer; Mao, Jie",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-04458-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424123/,388

This systematic review summarizes all the data currently available on the AI-assisted CT-Scan prediction accuracy for COVID-19. The ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Science Direct, PROSPERO, and EMBASE were systematically searched. We used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool to assess all included studies' quality and potential bias. A hierarchical receiver-operating characteristic summary (HSROC) curve and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve have been implemented. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the diagnostic accuracy. Finally, 36 studies (a total of 39,246 image data) were selected for inclusion into the final meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity for AI was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.90-0.91), specificity was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.92) and the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98). For deep learning (DL) method, the pooled sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.90 - 0.91), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87 - 0.88) and the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93 - 0.97).

676675,Coronavirus lockdown: forced inactivity for the oldest old?,2020-04-28,"Introduction The rapid surge of cases and insufficient numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) beds have forced hospitals to utilise their general wards for administration of non-invasive respiratory support including HFNC(High Flow Nasal Cannula) in severe COVID-19. However, there is a dearth of data on the success of such advanced levels of care outside the ICU setting. Therefore, we conducted an observational study at our centre, and systematically reviewed the literature, to assess the success of HFNC in managing severe COVID-19 cases outside the ICU. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral centre where records of all adult COVID-19 patients (over 18 years) requiring HFNC support were between September and December 2020 were analysed. HFNC support was adjusted to target SpO2 over 90% and respiratory rate less than 30 per min. The clinical, demographic, laboratory, and treatment details of these patients were retrieved from the medical records and entered in predesigned proforma. Outcome parameters included duration of oxygen during hospital stay, duration of HFNC therapy, length of hospital stay and death or discharge. HFNC success was denoted when a patient did not require escalation of therapy to NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation, or shifting to the ICU, and was eventually discharged from the hospital without oxygen therapy; otherwise, the outcome was denoted as HFNC failure. Systematic review was also performed on the available literature on the experience with HFNC in COVID-19 patients outside of ICU settings using the MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase databases. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of STATA software, version 12, OpenMeta[Analyst], and visualization of the risk of bias plot using robvis. Results Thirty-one patients receiving HFNC in the ward setting, had a median age of 62 (50 - 69) years including 24 (77%) males. Twenty-one (68%) patients successfully tolerated HFNC and were subsequently discharged from the wards, while 10 (32%) patients had to be shifted to ICU for non-invasive or invasive ventilation, implying HFNC failure. Patients with HFNC failure had higher median D-dimer values at baseline (2.2 mcg/ml vs 0.6 mcg/ml, p=0.001) and lower initial SpO2 on room air at admission (70% vs 80%, p=0.026) as compared to those in whom HFNC was successful .A cut-off value of 1.7 mg/L carried a high specificity (90.5%) and moderate sensitivity (80%) for the occurrence of HFNC failure. Radiographic severity scoring as per the BRIXIA score was comparable in both the groups(11 vs 10.5 out of 18, p=0.78 ). After screening 98 articles, total of seven studies were included for synthesis in the systematic review with a total of 820 patients, with mean age of the studies ranging from 44 to 83 years and including 62% males. After excluding 2 studies from the analysis, the pooled rates of HFNC failure were 36.3% (95% CI 31.1% - 41.5%) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 =0%, p=0.55). Conclusions Our study demonstrated successful outcomes with use of HFNC in an outside of ICU setting among two-thirds of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Lower room air SpO2 and higher D-dimer levels at presentation were associated with failure of HFNC therapy leading to ICU transfer for endotracheal intubation or death. Also, the results from the systematic review demonstrated similar rates of successful outcomes concluding that HFNC is a viable option with failure rates similar to those of ICU settings in such patients.","Aggarwal, A.; Arora, U.; Mittal, A.; Singh, K.; Ray, A.; Soneja, M.; Jorwal, P.; Nischal, N.; Singh, A.; Khanna, P.; Wig, N.; Trikha, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.23.21259045; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.23.21259045v1?rss=1,388

An experimental setup with two mannequin heads positioned at 1.70m high and at 25 cm each other was used. A fogger generated a particle's airflow with a speed of 5m/sec from the emitter to the receiver head mannequin. Our aerosol generator produced 3 000 times more particles than a physiological cough situation. A particle counter allowed us to evaluate the number of particles received on a mannequin head located at a very short distance of 25 cm. The amount of all particles up to the selected particle sizes were counted with an optical particle counter on channels 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 1 m, 2.5 m, 5 m and 10 m. The reduction factors with a protection worn by the receiver alone, by the emitter alone and then the double protection of emitter and receiver were calculated. When the receiver alone wore a face shield, the amount of total particles was reduced (54.8%), while the reduction was less when the receiver alone wore a mask (21.8%) (p = 0.003). Wearing a protection by the emitter alone reduced much more the level of particles received by 96.8% for both mask and face shield. The double protection allowed for even better results, but close to the protection of the emitter alone: 98% reduction for the face shields and 97.3% for the masks (p=0.022). Even with small particle size emission ([≤]0.3m), results were of the same order. Considering our results, protection of the emitter alone or double protection is much more effective than protection of the receiver only. Face shield should be included as part of strategies to safely and significantly reduce transmission in the community setting, in addition to masks or for people with disabilities or medical intolerance to masks.","Rochoy, M.; Fabacher, T.; Cosperec, I.; Wendling, J.-M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.20237149; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.23.20237149v1?rss=1,388

We aimed to investigate whether bone phosphorus retention and bone development might be regulated by related hormones and local bone-derived regulators in broilers. METHODS: Broilers were fed diets containing different levels of non-phytate phosphorus (NPP) 0.15%, 0.25%, 0.35%, 0.45% and 0.55% or 0.15%, 0.22%, 0.29%, 0.36% and 0.43% from 1 to 21 or 22 to 42 days of age. Serum and tibia samples were collected for determinations of bone phosphorus retention and bone development parameters, related hormones and local bone-derived regulators of broiler chickens on d 14, 28 and 42, respectively. RESULTS: Tibia ash phosphorus, total phosphorus accumulation in tibia ash (TP(TA)), bone mineral concentration (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), bone breaking strength (BBS), and ash on d 14, 28 or 42, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) on d 28 and 42, mRNA expressions of tibia fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) on d 14 and 28 increased linearly or quadratically (P < 0.05), while serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) on d 28, tibia alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on d 14, 28 and 42, bone gal protein (BGP) on d 14, and mRNA expression of tibia phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX) on d 14 and 28 decreased linearly or quadratically (P < 0.04) as dietary NPP level increased. TP(TA,) BMC, BMD, and ash on d 28 and 42, BBS on d 28, and ash phosphorus on d 42 were positively correlated (r = 0.389 to 0.486, P < 0.03) with serum 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). All of the above parameters were positively correlated (r = 0.380 to 0.689, P < 0.05) with tibia DMP1 mRNA expression on d 14, 28 and 42, but negatively correlated (r = − 0.609 to − 0.538, P < 0.02) with serum PTH on d 28, tibia ALP on d 14, 28 and 42, and BGP on d 14. TP(TA), BMC and ash on d 14 and BMD on d 28 were negatively correlated (r = − 0.397 to − 0.362, P < 0.03) with tibia PHEX mRNA expression, and BMD on d 28 was positively correlated (r = 0.384, P = 0.04) with tibia FGF23 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that bone phosphorus retention and bone development parameters had moderate to strong correlations with serum PTH and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and tibia DMP1, PHEX, FGF23, ALP and BGP in broilers during the whole growth period, and thus they might be partly regulated by these related hormones and local bone-derived regulators.

680302,COVID-19 Preparedness in U.S. Home Healthcare Agencies,2020-06-04,"OBJECTIVE: Population-level economic burden is essential for prioritizing healthcare resources and healthcare budget making in the future. However, little is known about the economic burden of lung cancer in China. METHODS: A prevalence-based approach was adopted to estimate the economic burden of lung cancer, including direct expenditure (medical and non-medical) and indirect cost (disability and premature death). Data on direct expenditure and work-loss days per patient in each year post-diagnosis were obtained from two primary surveys. Other parameters were obtained from literatures and official reports. Projections were conducted based on varying parameters. All expenditure data were reported in United States dollars (USD) using 2017 value (exchange rate: 1 USD= 6.760 CNY), with the discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: The total economic burden of lung cancer was estimated to be 25,069 million USD in China in 2017 (0.121% of gross domestic productivity, GDP). The estimated direct expenditure was 11,098 million USD, up to 1.43% of total healthcare expenditure for China, covering 10,303 million USD and 795 million USD for medical and non-medical expenditure, respectively. The estimated indirect cost was 13,971 million, including 1,517 million USD due to disability and 12,454 million USD due to premature death. Under current assumptions, the projected total economic burden would increase to 30.1 billion USD, 40.4 billion USD, and 53.4 billion USD in 2020, 2025, and 2030, accounting for 0.121%, 0.131%, and 0.146% of China’s GDP, respectively. However, if China meets the United Nation sustainable development goal of reducing premature death from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030, the total economic burden in 2030 would be 31.9 billion USD, 0.087% of China’s GDP. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of lung cancer in China in 2017 is substantial and more likely to increase significantly in the future. Policy makers need to take urgent actions in budget making for health systems. The economic burden could be alleviated by reducing the disease burden of lung cancer via effective control and prevention actions.","Liu, Chengcheng; Shi, Jufang; Wang, Hong; Yan, Xinxin; Wang, Le; Ren, Jiansong; Parascandola, Mark; Chen, Wanqing; Dai, Min",Chin J Cancer Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707931/; https://doi.org/10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2021.01.09,388

Progresses in these areas will be helpful to vaccine design and antiviral drugs discovery. Mass spectrometry based proteomics have shown exceptional display of capabilities, not only precisely identifying viral and cellular proteins that are functionally, structurally, and dynamically changed upon virus infection, but also enabling us to detect important pathway proteins. In addition, many isolation and purification techniques and quantitative strategies in conjunction with MS can significantly improve the sensitivity of mass spectrometry for detecting low-abundant proteins, replenishing the stock of virus proteome and enlarging the protein–protein interaction maps.

Recent advances regarding the utility of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to specifically inhibit HIV-1 replication have opened new possibilities for the development of gene-based therapies against HIV-1 infection. Here, the recent advances in siRNA-based therapies are reviewed.","Martínez, Miguel Angel",siRNA and miRNA Gene Silencing,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60327-547-7_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301656/,388

The demographic consequences of not measuring age correctly are manifold, including errors in mortality rates and population estimates, particularly at older ages. It also affects public programs because target populations depend on reliable population age distributions. In Brazil, the start of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 marked the collection of new administrative data. Every citizen must be registered and need to show an identity document to get vaccinated. The requirement of proof-of-age documentation provides a unique opportunity for measuring the elderly population using a different database. This article examines the reliability of age distributions of men and women 80 years and older. We calculate various demographic indicators using data from the vaccination registration system and compare them to those from the target population estimates of the National Vaccination Plan, censuses, and population projections for Brazil and countries with high-quality population data. We show that requiring proof-of-age, such as in the vaccination records, increases data quality, mainly through the reduction of age heaping and age exaggeration. However, I.D. cards cannot fully solve wrong birth dates that result from weak historical registration systems. Thus, one should be careful when using estimates of the old age population living in some of the Brazilian regions, particularly the North, Northeast, and Center-West. Also, our analysis reveals a mismatch between the projected population by age, sex, and region, which guided the vaccination plan, and the number of vaccinated at ages 80 and older. The methodology developed to adjust the mortality rates used in the demographic projections is probably the main factor behind the disparities found.","Turra, C.

688541,COVID-19: Magnifying the Effect of Health Disparities,2020-05-11,"Pannexin1 (PANX1) is a ubiquitously expressed, channel-forming protein found in a number of tissues thoughout the body (e.g. lung, vasculature, liver, central nervous system, immune system) that is important in many key physiological and immune responses. PANX1 channels passively flux ATP (predominantly), multiple metabolites, and likely other small anions. PANX1 channels regulate inflammation and host responses to several pathogens, including viruses. While there is currently no evidence suggesting novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and PANX1 directly interact, there is an urgent need for therapeutic strategies, especially those targeting the hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm that occurs in severe cases of COVID-19. Here we argue that PANX1, and drugs known to target PANX1 (including the FDA-approved drug probenecid), should be the focus of further investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated pathology in COVID-19 patients.","Swayne, Leigh Anne; Johnstone, Scott R.; Ng, Chen Seng; Sanchez-Arias, Juan C.; Good, Miranda E.; Penuela, Silvia; Lohman, Alexander W.; Wolpe, Abigail G.; Laubach, Victor E.; Koval, Michael; Isakson, Brant E.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519892/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00146.2020,388
