Although associated with these diseases there are vast ethical challenges, ethics has more focused on other health related issues – e.g. associated with rare diseases, embryo research, genetic diagnosis. Nowadays we are facing a possible influenza pandemic caused by a new human influenza virus subtype. This article presents issues and ethical challenges of the pandemic threat. The authors argue that it is necessary to consider ethical implications of pandemic influenza preparedness early on and to include ethical reasoning when deciding on the measures for the pandemic management.","Schröder-Bäck, P.; Sass, H.-M.; Brand, H.; Winter, S.

Infectious diseases are classified according to their etiology, affected body system or the life period during which the episode occurs. Specific challenges arise from emerging pathogens and the respective necessary adaptation. For epidemiologic analysis ICD-10 does not always offer enough additional information. ICD provides the basis for international comparison of infectious disease morbidity and mortality statistics, but it is also used to collect data for surveillance and research purposes, e. g. the notification system for infectious diseases, syndromic surveillance systems and the evaluation of data quality by using secondary data sources. ICD-11 offers the chance to better represent epidemiological concepts of infectious diseases by adding more relevant information as affected body system or manifestation. Due to the complexity of coding, ensuring continuity of morbidity and mortality statistics could be challenging.","Diercke, Michaela; Beermann, Sandra; Tolksdorf, Kristin; Buda, Silke; Kirchner, Göran",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079900/,448

PURPOSE: To provide direction for health care professionals in the preparation and management of emergency ICU situations during an influenza epidemic or mass disaster, standardize activities, and promote coordination and communication among the medical teams. METHODS: Based on a literature review and contributions of content experts, a list of essential categories for managing emergency situations in the ICU were identified. Based on three cycles of a modified Delphi process, consensus was achieved regarding the categories. A primary author along with an expert group drafted SOPs for each category. RESULTS: Based on the Delphi cycles, the following key topics were found to be important for emergency preparedness: triage, infrastructure, essential equipment, manpower, protection of staff and patients, medical procedures, hospital policy, coordination and collaboration with interface units, registration and reporting, administrative policies and education. CONCLUSIONS: The draft SOPs serve as benchmarks for emergency preparedness and response of ICUs to emergencies or outbreak of pandemics.","Sprung, Charles L.; Cohen, Robert; Adini, Bruria",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079978/,448

Pair-approximation models and individual-based network simulation have been used extensively to model contact networks with non-trivial properties. In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses. The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this. For a special class of graphs, we show how the lumped system can be obtained by using graph automorphisms. Finally, we discuss the advantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping.","Simon, Péter L.; Taylor, Michael; Kiss, Istvan Z.",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079990/,448

In this paper we use a paradigm model to show that environmental transmission appears like direct transmission in the case where the pathogen persists little time in the environment. Furthermore, we formulate conditions for the validity of this modeling approximation and we illustrate them numerically for the cases of cholera and influenza. According to our results based on recently published parameter estimates, the direct transmission approximation fails for both cholera and influenza. While environmental transmission is typically chosen over direct transmission in modeling cholera, this is not the case for influenza.","Breban, Romulus",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079992/,448

The mutants exhibited alterations in plaque morphology, hemagglutination, and virulence in mice, but were not temperature-sensitive. Agglutination of human erythrocytes by mengovirus was dependent on the presence of sialic acid on the erythrocyte surface; however, free sialic acid failed to inhibit hemagglutination. Glycophorin, the major sialoglycoprotein of human erythrocyte membranes, exhibited receptor specificity for wild-type virus, but not for mutants 205 or 280. Cross-linking studies indicated that glycophorin exhibited binding specificity for the alpha (1 D) structural protein. The LD(50) titers for wild-type mengovirus were 7 and 1500 plaque forming units (PFU) in mice infected intracranially (IC) and intraperitoneally (IP), respectively. However, mice infected IC or IP with 10(6) or 10(7) PFU of mutant 205 or 280 did not exhibit symptoms indicative of virus infection. Revertants were isolated from the brains of mice infected with mutant 205, but not from the brains of mice infected with mutant 280. The biological characterization of the revertants indicated that hemagglutination and virulence may be phenotypically-linked traits.","Anderson, Kevin; Bond, Clifford W.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087273/,448

6110,Mitteilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Innere Medizin,2009-06-16,"Hantaviruses belong to the group of “emerging” viruses. Pathogenic European hantaviruses can cause a human disease designated “hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome” of varying severity. In general, diagnostics of hantavirus infections are based on immunofluorescence assays using virus-infected cells or enzyme immunoassays and Western blot tests using recombinant nucleocapsid proteins. For highly sensitive detection of hantavirus-specific antibodies in the enzyme immunoassay, a homologous hantavirus nucleocapsid protein is needed as a diagnostic antigen. Serological typing of hantavirus infections can be obtained by neutralization assays, which in certain cases require the use of late convalescent sera. The seroprevalence in the normal German population is about 1%. In professionally exposed risk groups, e. g., forest workers, a seroprevalence higher than that in the normal population was observed. Endemic regions for hantavirus infections are located mainly in Baden-Württemberg. In the years 2001–2003 an annual number of about 200 clinically apparent hantavirus infections were registered in Germany. Neutralization assays detected almost exclusively human infections caused by Puumala and Dobrava viruses, only very rarely by Tula virus. Until this day in Germany mainly mild to moderate courses of human hantavirus infections have been documented. Besides infections caused by “German” hantaviruses, up to 10% of the clinically apparent hantavirus infections registered annually in Germany are caused by infections imported from other countries, mainly from Europe. So far only very limited molecular genetic data about the circulating hantaviruses in Germany are available. Additional investigations are needed to get a more precise picture about the distribution of hantaviruses in Germany and to calculate the resulting risk for the human population.","Ulrich, R.; Meisel, H.; Schütt, M.; Schmidt, J.; Kunz, A.; Klempa, B.; Niedrig, M.; Pauli, G.; Krüger, D.

Consistent with this old concept, the term “systemic inflammatory response syndrome” (SIRS) was coined about 25 years ago and has been regularly used ever since. In 2016, a sepsis task force was formed to re-evaluate the current definition on a scientific basis. The task force suggested a third definition (sepsis-3) of the disease that now focuses both on the pathological host response and on organ dysfunction as obligatory key features to diagnose sepsis. In this review article, the definition is explained in detail and we summarize the novel international sepsis guideline from 2017 with personal commentaries.","David, S.; Brunkhorst, F.

6153,Management der saisonalen Influenza 2017/2018: Erfahrungen an einem deutschen Universitätsklinikum,2019-06-14,"T helper cells can support the functions of CD8(+) T cells against persistently infecting viruses such as murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus and HIV. These viruses often resist complete elimination and remain detectable at sanctuary sites, such as the kidneys and other extralymphatic organs. The mechanisms underlying this persistence are not well understood. Here we show that mice with potent virus-specific T-cell responses have reduced levels and delayed formation of neutralizing antibodies, and these mice fail to clear LCMV from extralymphatic epithelia. Transfer of virus-specific B cells but not virus-specific T cells augmented virus clearance from persistent sites. Virus elimination from the kidneys was associated with the formation of IgG deposits in the interstitial space, presumably from kidney-infiltrating B cells. CD8(+) T cells in the kidneys of mice that did not clear virus from this site were activated but showed evidence of exhaustion. Thus, we conclude that in this model of infection, site-specific virus persistence develops as a consequence of potent immune activation coupled with reductions in virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that sanctuary-site formation depends both on organ anatomy and on the induction of different adaptive immune effector mechanisms. Boosting T-cell responses alone may not reduce virus persistence.

We provide a concise summary of the manner in which the scientific community has allocated its efforts to this issue in recent decades, and to illuminate trends that emerge from the literature. Our search yielded 620 publications encompassing 139 invasive zooplankton species, with invasive zooplankton reported from every region of the planet—including the Arctic and Antarctic. Most taxa were reported in a small number of publications, with the majority being mentioned in only a single paper. In contrast, approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned just four species: Bythotrephes longimanus, Mnemioposis leidyi, Cercopagis pengoi, and Daphnia lumholtzi. Our survey reveals strong geographic patterns among the literature, with most publications arising from economically developed western nations. We found that the majority of publications pertained to holoplanktonic organisms from freshwater habitats, especially from the North American Great Lakes.

One of these renowned approaches is Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are synthetic receptors with the ability to be expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and are specifically designed to target a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) of interest. CAR-expressing T cells have the capability of proliferating and maintaining their immunological functionality in the recipient body but like any other therapeutic approach, the safety, effectiveness, and specificity enhancement of CAR T cells still lingers in the ambiguity arena. Genetic manipulation methods, expansion protocols, infusion dosage, and conditioning regimens are all among crucial factors which can affect the efficacy of CAR T cell-based cancer therapy.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an enhanced recovery protocol after minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy. METHODS: Data were collected between January 2015 and April 2020 for patients who underwent esophagectomy. Of these patients, those who underwent minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy was selected for the investigation. Perioperative outcomes and nutritional index were compared using propensity score matching between the conventional group and the enhanced recovery group. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 73 and 46 were treated with conventional and enhanced recovery protocol, respectively. Forty-two pairs were matched in two groups. The enhanced recovery group showed a lower rate of pulmonary complications (9.5% vs. 28.5%, p = 0.0235), abdominal dysfunctions (16.7% vs. 42.9%, p = 0.0078), and shorter hospital stay as compared with the conventional group (17.5 days vs. 23 days, p = 0.0034). The loss of body weight (6.3% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.0065) and body mass index (5.6% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.0017) were significantly lower in the enhanced recovery group than in the conventional group.

16544,Mitteilungen der DGIIN,2021-04-01,"This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public’s willingness, attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research participation by providing health information and biological material. The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide ‘traditional’ types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health research efforts.","Brall, Caroline; Berlin, Claudia; Zwahlen, Marcel; Ormond, Kelly E.; Egger, Matthias; Vayena, Effy",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016315/,448

Kongress der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Innere Medizin e.V.,2021-04-19,"INTRODUCTION: Opioids are potent painkillers but can have severe adverse effects in the intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of fentanyl and morphine use among patients at risk for and with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We developed a dataset of real-world data to enable the comparison of the effectiveness and safety of opioids and the associated outcomes from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Patients who were admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of or at risk for ARDS and received mechanical ventilation for at least 12 h were included. Patients were enrolled sequentially into one of six groups in three cohorts: treated with fentanyl or not; treated with morphine or not; and treated with fentanyl or morphine. Propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fentanyl was associated with higher in-hospital mortality in the propensity score-matched model but not in the linear regression model. The use of morphine was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality in both models. Both fentanyl and morphine were associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospitalization and a decreased likelihood of being discharged home in both models. Notably, compared with morphine, fentanyl was associated with a lower mortality and an increased likelihood of being discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: Both fentanyl and morphine were independent risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with or at risk for ARDS. Compared with morphine, fentanyl may be preferred in these patients.

Although several researchers have used current state-of-the-art approaches and have produced impressive chest-related clinical outcomes, specific techniques may not contribute many advantages if one type of disease is detected without the rest being identified. Those who tried to identify multiple chest-related diseases were ineffective due to insufficient data and the available data not being balanced. This research provides a significant contribution to the healthcare industry and the research community by proposing a synthetic data augmentation in three deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures for the detection of 14 chest-related diseases. The employed models are DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet152V2; after training and validation, an average ROC-AUC score of 0.80 was obtained competitive as compared to the previous models that were trained for multi-class classification to detect anomalies in x-ray images.

17951,„Politische Kindermedizin“,2021-05-31,"Background: Military training plays an important protective role in enhancing mental health. However, the effects of military training on psychological resilience and depression among college freshmen in China remain unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate changes in psychological resilience and depression through military training among college freshmen, and to investigate associated psychosocial factors including childhood trauma that may influence its effects on psychological resilience. Methods: A prospective and self-comparison study design was employed. College freshmen who received 3 weeks of military training were recruited. Socio-demographic variables were collected and childhood trauma exposure was estimated by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to assess psychological resilience and depression before and after the military-style training. Results: The military training significantly increased the total and subscale scores of CD-RISC (p < 0.001), and decreased the PHQ-9 score (p < 0.001). The proportion of students with clinical depression reduced from 10.5% at baseline to 7.2% after the training (p < 0.001). Improvement of CD-RISC scores was positively affected by male gender and urban area, while negatively affected by older age, and higher baseline scores of PHQ-9 and CTQ. A significant correlation was found between changes in scores of CD-RISC and PHQ-9 through the training (r = −0.238, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Military training may have a positive effect on increasing psychological resilience and reducing depressive symptoms among college freshmen, especially in male students and those from an urban area, while older age, childhood trauma, higher depression levels, and resilience at baseline may weaken, or even mask its positive effect. Follow-up research should be considered for the long-term effects of military-style training.","Guo, Rui; Sun, Meng; Zhang, Chi; Fan, Zebin; Liu, Zhening; Tao, Haojuan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8166047/,448
18379,Amalgam und Alternativen – Diskussionen zur Quecksilberreduktion in der Umwelt,2021-06-18,"Opioids are perhaps the most effective analgesics in medicine. However, between 1999 and 2018, over 400,000 people in the United States died from opioid overdose. Excessive opioids make breathing lethally slow and shallow, a side-effect called opioid-induced respiratory depression. This doubled-edged sword has sparked the desire to develop novel therapeutics that provide opioid-like analgesia without depressing breathing. One such approach has been the design of so-called ‘biased agonists’ that signal through some, but not all pathways downstream of the µ-opioid receptor (MOR), the target of morphine and other opioid analgesics. This rationale stems from a study suggesting that MOR-induced ß-arrestin 2 dependent signaling is responsible for opioid respiratory depression, whereas adenylyl cyclase inhibition produces analgesia. To verify this important result that motivated the ‘biased agonist’ approach, we re-examined breathing in ß-arrestin 2-deficient mice and instead find no connection between ß-arrestin 2 and opioid respiratory depression. This result suggests that any attenuated effect of ‘biased agonists’ on breathing is through an as-yet defined mechanism.","Bachmutsky, Iris; Wei, Xin Paul; Durand, Adelae; Yackle, Kevin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213404/,448
18988,Parodontitis – Therapie einer Volkskrankheit,2021-07-08,"Diabetic patients are more vulnerable to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury and have a worse prognosis and higher mortality after ischemic stroke than non-diabetic counterparts. Melatonin can exert neuroprotective effects against CIR injury in nondiabetic animal models. However, its effects on diabetic CIR injury and the underlying mechanisms remain unclarified. Herein, we found that melatonin administration improved neurological deficit, cerebral infarct volume, brain edema, and cell viability, reduced mitochondrial swelling, reactive oxygen species generation, and cytoplasmic cytochrome C release, and increased mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes activities, adenosine triphosphate production, and mitochondrial membrane potential in both streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and high glucose-treated HT22 cells. Importantly, melatonin also activated protein kinase B (Akt) and sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)/superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) signaling and upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis-related transcription factors. However, these effects were largely attenuated by LY294002 (a specific Akt signaling blocker) administration. Additionally, 3-TYP (a selective SIRT3 inhibitor) and SIRT3 siRNA inhibited the above protective effects of melatonin as well as the upregulation of SIRT3 and the decrease of SOD2 acetylation but did not affect the p-Akt/Akt ratio. Overall, we demonstrate that melatonin can alleviate CIR injury in diabetic mice by activating Akt-SIRT3-SOD2 signaling and subsequently improving mitochondrial damage.","Liu, Lian; Cao, Quan; Gao, Wenwei; Li, Bingyu; Xia, Zhongyuan; Zhao, Bo",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8266371/,448

It is well documented that the use of immunosuppressant therapies dramatically increases this risk in patients with cancer, transplantation, and immunologic disease. Although immune monitoring has yet to be universally embraced, withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapies and use of immune restoration therapies is the standard of care when these patients develop sepsis. Critical illness stress can also induce a level of immunosuppression which is as life-threatening as is seen in the purposefully immunosuppressed patient. This chapter reviews the role of critical illness stress-induced immunosuppression in the development of nosocomial sepsis and MOF, and outlines clinical strategies which can be employed to maintain and restore immune function, and reduce morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.","Carcillo, J.

25189,Pädiatrie,2010-05-20,"The prevailing theory of autoimmune disease, that the body creates autoantibodies that attack “self,” was developed during an era when culture-based methods vastly underestimated the number of microbes capable of persisting in and on Homo sapiens. Thanks to the advent of culture-independent tools, the human body is now known to harbor billions of microbes whose collective genomes work in concert with the human genome. Thus, the human genome can no longer be studied in isolation. Some of these microbes persist by slowing the activity of the vitamin D receptor nuclear receptor, affecting the expression of endogenous antimicrobials and other key components of the innate immune system. It seems that bacteria that cause autoimmune disease accumulate over a lifetime, with individuals picking up pathogens with greater ease over time, as the immune response becomes increasingly compromised. Any one autoimmune disease is likely due to many different microbes within the metagenomic microbiota. This helps explain the high levels of comorbidity observed among patients with autoimmune conditions. What are commonly believed to be autoantibodies may instead be created in response to this metagenomic microbiota when the adaptive immune system is forced to deal with disintegration of infected cells. Similarly, haplotypes associated with autoimmune conditions vary widely among individuals and populations. They are more suggestive of a regional infectious model rather than a model in which an illness is caused by inherited variation of HLA haplotypes","Proal, Amy D.; Albert, Paul J.; Marshall, Trevor G.",Metagenomics of the Human Body,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121718/,448

The first function identified for Arf proteins was recruitment of cytosolic coat complexes to membranes to mediate vesicle formation. However, subsequent studies have uncovered additional functions, including roles in plasma membrane signalling pathways, cytoskeleton regulation, lipid droplet function, and non-vesicular lipid transport. In contrast to other families of G proteins, there are only a few Arf proteins in each organism, yet they function specifically at many different cellular locations. Part of this specificity is achieved by formation of complexes with their guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyse GTP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. Because these regulators outnumber their Arf substrates by at least 3-to-1, an important aspect of understanding Arf function is elucidating the mechanisms by which a single Arf protein is incorporated into different GEF, GAP, and effector complexes. New insights into these mechanisms have come from recent studies showing GEF–effector interactions, Arf activation cascades, and positive feedback loops. A unifying theme in the function of Arf proteins, carried out in conjunction with their regulators and effectors, is sensing and modulating the properties of the lipids that make up cellular membranes.","Jackson, Catherine L.",Ras Superfamily Small G Proteins: Biology and Mechanisms 2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123483/,448

MetaTrans is used to train a model to predict performance improvement ratio from historical transfer learning experiences, and can consider both the Transferability between tasks and the Discriminability emphasized on targets. We apply this method to both shallow and deep transfer learning algorithms, providing a detail explanation for the success of specific transfer learning algorithms. From experimental studies, we find that different transfer learning algorithms have varying dominant factor deciding their success, so we propose a multi-task learning framework which can learn both common and specific experience from historical transfer learning results.

Due to low-paid workers and inherent noise, the quality of acquired data could be easily degraded. To solve this, most previous studies have sought to infer the true answer from noisy labels in discrete multiple-choice tasks that ask workers to select one of several answer candidates. However, recent crowdsourcing tasks have become more complicated and usually consist of real-valued vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel inference algorithm for vector regression tasks which ask workers to provide accurate vectors such as image object localization and human posture estimation. Our algorithm can estimate the true answer of each task and a reliability of each worker by updating two types of messages iteratively. We also prove its performance bound which depends on the number of queries per task and the average quality of workers. Under a certain condition, we prove that its average performance becomes close to an oracle estimator which knows the reliability of every worker.

In general, ReID is an extremely challenging task due to complex background clutters, large pose variations and severe occlusions. To improve its performance, a robust and discriminative feature extraction methodology is particularly crucial. Recently, the feature alignment technique driven by human pose estimation, that is, matching two person images with their corresponding parts, increases the effectiveness of ReID to a certain extent. However, we argue that there are still a few problems among these methods such as imprecise handcrafted segmentation of body parts, and some improvements can be further achieved. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Mask-Guided Region Attention Network (MGRAN) for person ReID. MGRAN consists of two major components: Mask-guided Region Attention (MRA) and Multi-feature Alignment (MA). MRA aims to generate spatial attention masks and meanwhile mask out the background clutters and occlusions. Moreover, the generated masks are utilized for region-level feature alignment in the MA module. We then evaluate the proposed method on three public datasets, including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03.

In most cases these sound detection models are trained on publicly available sound databases, up to now, however, they do not include acoustic data from manufacturing environments. Within manufacturing industries, acoustic data can be exploited in order to evaluate the correct execution of assembling processes. As an example, in this paper the correct plugging of connectors is analyzed on the basis of multimodal contextual process information. The latter are the connector’s acoustic properties and visual information recorded in form of video files while executing connector locking processes. For the first time optical microphones are used for the acquisition and analysis of connector sound data in order to differentiate connector locking sounds from each other respectively from background noise and sound events with similar acoustic properties. Therefore, different types of feature representations as well as neural network architectures are investigated for this specific task. The results from the proposed analysis show, that multimodal approaches clearly outperform unimodal neural network architectures for the task of connector locking validation by reaching maximal accuracy levels close to 85[Formula: see text]. Since in many cases there are no additional validation methods applied for the detection of correctly locked connectors in manufacturing industries, it is concluded that the proposed connector lock event detection framework is a significant improvement for the qualitative validation of plugging operations.","Bricher, David; Müller, Andreas",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256605/,448

Many educators are hesitant to give authority to an automated system, especially in assessment tasks such as grading constructed response items. However, evaluating free-response text can be time and labor costly for one rater, let alone multiple raters. In addition, some degree of inconsistency exists within and between raters for assessing a given task. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing have resulted in subsequent improvements for technologies that rely on artificial intelligence and human language. New, state-of-the-art models such as BERT, an open source, pre-trained language model, have decreased the amount of training data needed for specific tasks and in turn, have reduced the amount of human annotation necessary for producing a high-quality classification model. After training BERT on expert ratings of constructed responses, we use subsequent automated grading to calculate Cohen’s Kappa as a measure of inter-rater reliability between the automated system and the human rater. For practical application, when the inter-rater reliability metric is unsatisfactory, we suggest that the human rater(s) use the automated model to call attention to ratings where a second opinion might be needed to confirm the rater’s correctness and consistency of judgement.","Condor, Aubrey",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334737/,448

Five challenges in particular are playing a central role for developed economies like Germany: firstly, growing criticism of international trade; secondly, increasing doubt about the reasonableness of further economic growth; thirdly, increasingly complex distributional conflicts; fourthly, diminishing political scope for policy actions by national governments; and fifthly, increased system competition between market economies and emerging markets. The corona pandemic will exacerbate numerous economic problems such as income inequality, the debts of states and companies, and growing protectionism. A central challenge for economic policy in Germany is that the conflicts of objectives are increasing while the possibilities for solutions in national policy-making are decreasing. It is becoming increasingly difficult to focus on allocation efficiency without considering issues of income and wealth distribution, environmental and climate impacts, immaterial aspects of life, etc. The development of appropriate economic policy responses to these challenges will therefore become even more demanding in the future than already being the case.

According to Georgian regulation, all patients with confirmed COVID-19 should be hospitalized. The data sources were hospitalization registry and the standardized case report forms. In this descriptive study, epidemiological characteristics of 500 COVID-19 cases confirmed with PCR tests were analyzed. Among variables were: gender, age and geographic distribution, disease characteristics, underlying health conditions, test-related features, etc. Majority of patients (72.0%) were admitted to hospitals by the ambulance. The mean age of the patients was 43 years. The sex distribution was merely the same for both genders (49.4% male and 50.6% female). The most common symptoms were fever (82.4%, 95% CI 78.4-85.9), fatigue (49.6%, 95% CI 44.7-54.5), and cough (38.3%, 95% CI 33.6-43.1). The proportion of asymptomatic cases during the PCR testing were 16.6%. More than one symptom was observed in 57.6% of patients. Most common underlying health conditions were cardiovascular diseases (21.8%), diabetes (7.6%), kidney disease (3.6%), chronic lung disease (2.4%), cancer (2.2%), and chronic hepatitis (1.8%).

Aim of the study was to assess concern, general and health-related knowledge (case management and Infection Prevention and Control [IPC] measures) among hospital staff on SARS-CoV-2 in Lombardy region (Italy). METHODS: One week after WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency we developed and online administered a 7-item questionnaire to all staff of San Raffaele Hospital, a referral and teaching hospital in Milan, exploring knowledge and attitudes on COVID-19. The survey remained accessible online for 72 hours. RESULTS: A total of 2,046, including HCWs and other staff, answered the survey (response rate 25%). Among the 2,027 responders included in the analysis, 1,102 were HCWs (54%), also in training, and 924 non-HCWs (46%). 60% of responders reported being worried or extremely worried about the epidemic. Concerning knowledge, the survey asked about modes of transmission, clinical forms, preventive measures in everyday life in Italy and cough etiquette. There were uniform trends in the two groups: HCWs were more aware and answered more properly (mean of correct answers 71,6%) than non-HCWs (mean 61,2%). HCWs were asked about IPC precautions, with only 41% providing correct answers, while over 74% knew only supportive therapy is currently available against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We were among the first to explore hospital staff knowledge on COVID-19 reporting data from a large study population.

40633,"""Die Qualität macht uns aus"": BVDD startet Online-Seminarreihe zur Telemedizin",2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND: Unaccompanied minors (UMs) are children under 18 settling in foreign countries without the care of a guardian. Host countries' governments are responsible for the care of UMs. In France, UMs theoretically receive child protection. However, assessment systems frequently deny their protection because of minority status rejection. As a result, they navigate through social precarity and have limited access to healthcare services. In Paris, the non-governmental organisation Médecins du Monde (MdM) offers them medico-psycho-social care. In March 2020, lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 further reduced unprotected UMs' access to social and healthcare services. This critical situation prompted MdM to adapt their care provision to the pandemic. In this research, we sought answers to the following research question: what were unprotected UMs' social and healthcare needs during lockdown and what was MdM's response? METHODS: First, we estimate the evolution of social and healthcare needs of a cohort of 58 unprotected UMs during the eight-week lockdown using secondary data. Second, using interview data with MdM volunteers and staff (n = 15) we further explore UMs' needs and document the experience of phone consultations with this cohort of UMs. PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Time series show a constant increase of UMs' needs through time. MdM's new form of care provision may have contributed to alleviate their feeling of isolation. It also had unintended consequences. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the alarming healthcare status of unprotected UMs, we recommend that France implements the public health authorities' recommendation to provide appropriate shelter to UMs regardless of their status, at least during health crises. KEY MESSAGES: This study fills a research gap related to a pressing political and public health issue. This study advances evidence-informed debates debates on the influence of models of care provision on UMs’ social and healthcare needs during health crises.","Gautier, L; Quesnel-Vallée, A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543403/,448

41902,Nutzen und Risiken sorgsam abwägen,2020-11-18,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (PSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affects exocrine glands. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in primary SS is extremely rare. In 10–20% of patients diagnosed with PSS, there are lesions in the central nervous system analogous to those presented in multiple sclerosis. We report a case of a 58-year-old female, diagnosed as PSS and multiple sclerosis (MS) (2007), but later, all neurological manifestations turned out to be related to PSS rather MS. This case illustrates how difficult it could be, distinguishing Sjögren’s with CNS involvement from MS, even to an expert clinician. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old lady presented to Rheumatology clinic in 2010 with polyarthralgia, sicca symptoms and Raynaud’s. Immunology tests (positive anti- RO & anti-LA antibodies) and lymph node biopsy were highly suggestive of primary Sjögren’s. She was commenced initially on HCQ and prednisolone. Then Methotrexate was added in because she continued to struggle with inflammatory arthritis. Her Sicca symptoms got gradually worse despite being on Acetylcysteine, Hylo Forte, cyclosporine and Dexamethasone eye drop. Therefore, autologous serum eye drops were tried with good response. Her past medical history included Hypertension and knee OA. She has been under Neurology since 2007 for MS. Her original neurological symptoms were imbalance, dizziness, headaches, and tremor of the right arm which seem to be persistent with no definite relapses. MRI brain and spine were reported as normal with a few non-specific white matter areas, but the lumbar puncture result was positive for unmatched bands in the CSF. Clinical examination revealed action tremor in the right upper limb. She had diminished vibration, pinprick, and cold temperature perception in a stocking distribution. INVESTIGATIONS: WBC 2.0, lymphocyte 0.62, DsDNA 1, C3 0.061, C4 0.01. CRP <5, PV 1.63, APS screen was negative NCS: evidence of sensory and axonal neuropathy predominantly affecting lower limbs. CTCAP 2018 – showed calcification of parotid. No evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder. The latest MRI 2019 showed two new lesions (right corpus &right striatum lesion) which according to Neuro-radiology MDT discussion were not typical of MS and more likely related to underlying CTD. Based on these MRI findings and the recent history of skin vasculitis, the deterioration in her neurological condition was put down to primary Sjögren’s. Therefore, her treatment was escalated to cyclophosphamide during the COVID-19 pandemic with a particularly good outcome. She was then switched to MMF and her condition remained stable. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Neurological disorders are one of the rare manifestations of primary Sjögren’s. The first reports regarding the involvement of the nervous system in PSS were published in 1980. Distinguishing between multiple sclerosis and CNS-SS is not easy. Not only because of similarities of the MRI findings, but also the course of the disease can be like MS, either chronic or relapsing and remitting. This usually leads to missing or delaying in the diagnosis as shown in this case. However, Peripheral neuropathy is far much common in PSS rather MS which can help in differentiating these two conditions. Distal axonal sensory polyneuropathy is the most usual form of neuropathy in PSS as illustrated in this case. Furthermore, up to 75% of patients with SS and active CNS disease have been shown to have concomitant active peripheral vasculitis affecting the skin, muscles, and nerves. Our patient later developed skin vasculitis and peripheral neuropathy which made us think that all the neurological findings including the lesions on the brain are more likely to be related to PSS rather MS. Cognitive disorders are common manifestations of CNS-SS such as attention disorder and memory deficit. Dementia-related to CNS-SS seems to be reversible after immunosuppressive treatment. A second MDT discussion took place and after considering the risk-benefit ratio, the decision was made to give cyclophosphamide. Patient was given all the information to make an informed decision. Patient asked for more time to think and discuss with her partner, but eventually, she had decided to have cyclophosphamide despite all the risks and uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic. Our patient has noticed significant improvement regarding cognition after completing cyclophosphamide treatment and she was pleased with this outcome. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: 1/ Distinguishing between multiple sclerosis and CNS-SS is difficult 2/ neurophysiological tests should be considered even in asymptomatic patients as they contribute to the detection of early and subtle damage to the nervous system. 3/ Successful outcome being achieved with intensive immunosuppression despite all the uncertainties around the COVID-19 -19 pandemic. 4/ This case highlights the importance of communication and openness in shared decisions, especially while confronting uncertainties such as in COVID-19 pandemic.","Mohamednour, Alaeldin; Durrani, Maumer",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607335/,448

The quantifying evaluation of the in vivo codes assigned by two raters for the categories “problems” and “coping” was carried out with the help of numerical ratios and detailed analyses of the codes that differentiate between the families. RESULTS: The lockdown resulted in a large number of problems in all families. While in families with mentally ill children the restrictions were the biggest problem, families with mentally ill parents reported mainly about a lack of support. Families with sick members more often reported about risky coping patterns, in particular rumination and denial, and less often about protective coping, especially the mobilization of social support.

Data art and other intersecting forms of art have been around for a while. Data artification, on the other hand, has hardly been discussed in the context of how non-art, i.e. data, is turned into art by artifying microprocesses (Shapiro 2019) or adaptive nano-processes (Dissanayake 2017). The existing body of research done so far in this area emphasize the social functions of artifying things, their makers, and users. The premise of this article is that social amelioration is secondary or even irrelevant in some cases where ratification, instead, plays cognitive and phenomenological roles in the face of intellectual crisis when datafied things and activities that are entangled with our lives in ubiquitous, automated, and overused ways lose their meaning. Data artification is not concerned with making data aesthetically appealing, hence it should not be confused with the notion of aestheticization. On the contrary, by drawing on the artwork of Fabio Lattanzi Antinori and Nathalie Miebach, I will argue that data artification is intellectually dissident in more radical ways than academia. It is critically meta-artistic and meta-scientific since it deconstructs empty data fetishes and produces new meanings or knowledge-making forms in interstitial and intersemiotic ways.","Salciute Civiliene, Gabriele",Advances in Design and Digital Communication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972457/,448

The H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus (AIV) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are common poultry pathogens that limit the development of the poultry industry. This study aimed to clarify the interaction between these two pathogens and their pathogenic mechanism using a mouse model. Co-infection with H9N2 AIV and E. coli significantly increased the mortality rate of mice compared to single viral or bacterial infections. It also led to the development of more severe lung lesions compared to single viral or bacterial infections. Co-infection further causes a storm of cytokines, which aggravates the host’s disease by dysregulating the JAK/STAT/SOCS and ERK1/2 pathways. Moreover, co-infection mutually benefited the virus and the bacteria by increasing their pathogen loads. Importantly, nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression was also significantly enhanced by the co-infection. It played a key role in the rapid proliferation of E. coli in the presence of the co-infecting H9N2 virus. Therefore, our study underscores the role of NOS2 as a determinant for bacteria growth and illustrates its importance as an additional mechanism that enhances influenza virus-bacteria synergy. It further provides a scientific basis for investigating the synergistic infection mechanism between viruses and bacteria.","Wang, Song; Jiang, Ning; Shi, Wenhao; Yin, Hang; Chi, Xiaojuan; Xie, Yanhui; Hu, Jingyun; Zhang, Yanwei; Li, Huangping; Chen, Ji-Long",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8097157/,448

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelets-to-lymphocyte ratios are newly emerging as more accessible and simple markers for the detection of the onset of infections. The objective of our study is to prove the value of these markers in the diagnosis of infections in hemodialysis patients. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study spread over one year including 85 chronic hemodialysis patients with duration of at least 6 months. patients with hemopathies, tumors, or with a history of hospitalization during the 3 months before the study were excluded. CRP was used as a biomarker of infections and N / L; P / L ratios were calculated to study the correlation between the two biomarkers. Based on the literature reviews, the threshold of the N / L ratio and the P / L ratio admitted for our stydy were respectively : > = 2.5 and > = 150. RESULTS: The mean age of our patients was 49 ± 19 years with a predominance of women (55%) .The average duration in hemodialysis was 67.2 months.

However, insufficient evidence has been found in relation to the environmental effect itself. Residential greenspace, as a convenient but limited natural environment for urban dwellers, has benefits and services yet to be discovered. Therefore, the current study recruited 24 young adults to evaluate the effects of physical visit to, or image viewing of, residential greenspace on pain perception and related psychophysiological outcomes, via simulated pain. Pain threshold and tolerance were recorded via the level of pain stimuli, and pain intensity was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The state scale of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and two adjective pairs were employed to measure the state anxiety and subjective stress, respectively. Meanwhile, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure (BP) were measured to investigate physiological responses. Besides, Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE) was also employed to assess participants’ preference regarding the experimental environments. The results revealed that visiting the greenspace significantly increased the pain threshold and tolerance, while no significant effect was observed for image viewing. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in pain-related psychophysiological indices between the experimental settings, but significantly negative associations were found between the scores of SBE and subjective stress and state anxiety.

Liquid crystals (LCs), as a branch of sensitive materials, offer promising applicability in the field of biosensing. Herein, we developed an ultrasensitive biosensor for the detection of low-concentration protein molecules, employing LC-amplified optofluidic resonators. In this design, the orientation of LCs was disturbed by immobilized protein molecules through the reduction of the vertical anchoring force from the alignment layer. A biosensing platform based on the whispering-gallery mode (WGM) from the LC-amplified optofluidic resonator was developed and explored, in which the spectral wavelength shift was monitored as the sensing parameter. The microbubble structure provided a stable and reliable WGM resonator with a high Q factor for LCs. It is demonstrated that the wall thickness of the microbubble played a key role in enhancing the sensitivity of the LC-amplified WGM microcavity. It is also found that protein molecules coated on the internal surface of microbubble led to their interactions with laser beams and the orientation transition of LCs. Both effects amplified the target information and triggered a sensitive wavelength shift in WGM spectra. A detection limit of 1 fM for bovine serum albumin (BSA) was achieved to demonstrate the high-sensitivity of our sensing platform in protein assays. Compared to the detection using a conventional polarized optical microscope (POM), the sensitivity was improved by seven orders of magnitude. Furthermore, multiple types of proteins and specific biosensing were also investigated to verify the potential of LC-amplified optofluidic resonators in the biomolecular detection. Our studies indicate that LC-amplified optofluidic resonators offer a new solution for the ultrasensitive real-time biosensing and the characterization of biomolecular interactions.

57965,Die Zukunft der Intensivmedizin,2021-09-16,"The obstacles and difficulties that science teachers face when teaching the nature of science (NOS) are well-known. Nonetheless, little is known of what science teacher educators (STEs) know, do, and think about this issue. Thus, a study with 142 Spanish STEs was conducted. This was aimed at analysing (i) what preparation the STEs have to teach NOS, (ii) what educational experience they have about NOS, (iii) what importance they give to NOS in their training plans, (iv) when NOS should be taught, (v) how to integrate NOS in science education, (vi) how to teach NOS, (vii) what to teach about NOS, and (viii) the influences interconnecting the STEs’ preparation, experience, and opinions regarding NOS teaching. Among the results, it was found that most STEs state that they have ample knowledge of NOS, are well prepared pedagogically to teach it, and have extensive experience in teaching it. However, there was some mismatch between their stated preparation and their experience teaching NOS. In addition, they think that NOS should be taught from early ages and be treated as cross-cutting content in science education. They also consider that, when teaching NOS, an implicit approach is just as effective as an explicit-reflective one. As for their selection of NOS content to include, they are fundamentally divided into two groups — those who select only epistemic aspects of NOS and those who select a balanced proportion of both epistemic and non-epistemic aspects. The limitations of the study are reported along with the issues that require further research.","García-Carmona, Antonio",Sci Educ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445499/,448
59775,Evidence-Based Abdominal Wall Reconstruction: The Maxi-Mini Approach.,2015,"Background: Teleneurology has become widely adopted during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic. However, provider impressions about the teleneurology experience are not well described. Methods: A novel questionnaire was developed to collect provider impressions about video teleneurology encounters. All providers in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) Neurology Department (N = 162) were asked to complete a questionnaire after each video teleneurology patient encounter between April and August 2020. Individual patient and encounter-level data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Results: One thousand six hundred three surveys were completed by 55 providers (response rate of 10.12%). The history obtained and the ability to connect with the patient were considered the same or better than an in-person visit in almost all encounters. The quality of the physician-patient relationship was good or excellent in 93%, while the overall experience was the same as an in-person visit in 73% of visits and better in 12%. Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported that none of the elements of the neurological examination if performed in person would have changed the assessment and plan. Assessment of the visit as the same or better increased from 83% in April to 89% in July and 95% in August. Headache (91%), multiple sclerosis and neuroimmunology (96%), and movement disorder (89%) providers had the highest proportion of ratings of same or better overall experience and neuromuscular providers the lowest (60%). Conclusions: Provider impressions about the teleneurology history, examination, and provider-patient relationship are favorable in the majority of responses. Important differences emerge between provider specialty and visit characteristics groups.","Tropea, Thomas F; Fuentes, Andrea; Roberts, Zachary; Spindler, Meredith; Yuan, Kristy; Perrone, Christopher; Do, David; Jacobs, Dina; Wechsler, Lawrence",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077285/,448

Identification of such contexts could be the key to defining gene function and also to develop novel therapeutic interventions. Here, we present Context-specific Essentiality Network-tools (CEN-tools), a website and python package, in which users can interrogate the essentiality of a gene from large-scale genome-scale CRISPR screens in a number of biological contexts including tissue of origin, mutation profiles, expression levels and drug responses. We show that CEN-tools is suitable for the systematic identification of genetic dependencies and for more targeted queries. The associations between genes and a given context are represented as dependency networks (CENs), and we demonstrate the utility of these networks in elucidating novel gene functions. In addition, we integrate the dependency networks with existing protein-protein interaction networks to reveal context-dependent essential cellular pathways in cancer cells. Together, we demonstrate the applicability of CEN-tools in aiding the current efforts to define the human cellular dependency map.","Sharma, Sumana; Dincer, Cansu; Weidemüller, Paula; Wright, Gavin J; Petsalaki, Evangelia",Molecular systems biology,https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20209698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073517/,448

To address the emerging mental health needs of older Veterans (e.g., social isolation) in the context of chronic underlying mental health needs (e.g., trauma), we developed an 8-week virtual group treatment manual. This article describes the results from a survey of geriatric mental health clinicians who used the COVID group manual to determine its acceptability and feasibility in these settings.Methods: Clinicians across three VA integrated care settings (home-based primary care, community living centers, and geriatric primary care) were surveyed about their experiences implementing this treatment (n = 21).Results: Clinicians found this intervention to be effective with their patients and useful and adaptable beyond the early pandemic period.Conclusions: This group teletherapy intervention was feasible and acceptable when treating Veterans in integrated geriatric healthcare settings. Despite technical challenges experienced by older Veterans, clinicians found this manual to be effective in addressing COVID-related worry and social isolation.Clinical Implications: This rapid response manual has remained clinically useful in geriatric mental health care settings beyond the initial weeks of the pandemic.","Weiskittle, Rachel; Tsang, William; Schwabenbauer, Anne; Andrew, Nathaniel; Mlinac, Michelle",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1906812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870881/,448

Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic effect of D-dimer testing in pregnant women with suspected PE. Methods This study recruited 100 women with confirmed pregnancy or six weeks after delivery or abortion with suspected PE symptoms. Wells criteria, D-dimer values, and pregnancy trimesters were recorded. Definitive PE results were obtained using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scans. Results D-dimer cut-off point in PE diagnosis was higher than 1,447 μg/L [sensitivity, 87.5%; specificity, 63.04%; area under the curve (AUC)=0.735; P=0.003]. In addition, the combination of Wells criteria with the D-dimer test indicated that the cut-off points of D-dimer in PE likely and unlikely women were 1,962 and 1,447 μg/L, respectively, and had acceptable and significant diagnostic value in PE detection. In addition, the diagnostic value of D-dimer in pregnancy trimesters was not found to be significant (P>0.05). Conclusion The new cut-off points of 1,447 and 1,962 μg/L were determined for D-dimer in pregnant women with likely and unlikely PE, respectively. Moreover, the new cut-off points in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy were 1,701 μg/L and 1,451 μg/L, respectively, which indicated no statistically acceptable diagnostic value.","Sadeghi, Somayeh; Golshani, Marjan; Safaeian, Bahareh",Blood research,https://doi.org/10.5045/br.2021.2021069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400590/,448

79260,Bioburden after Staphylococcus aureus inoculation in type 1 diabetic rats undergoing internal fixation.,2014,"BACKGROUND The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) still remains the gold standard in bariatric surgery. However, no consensus exists on the optimal limb lengths to induce maximum weight reduction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a longer alimentary limb (AL) length on weight reduction after RYGB. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent a primary laparoscopic RYGB between January 2001 and March 2011 was performed. Patients received a short AL (SAL; 100 cm) or a long AL (LAL; 150 cm). Primary outcome was weight loss, and secondary outcomes were short- and long-term complication rates. RESULTS A total of 768 patients received a RYGB during the study period. Of these, 730 consecutive patients were included for long-term analysis and had a mean follow-up (FU) of 37 ± 26 [range 0-120] months; 360 (47 %) patients received a SAL RYGB. Overall %TBWL was 33 ± 9 % after 2 years (FU 74 %) and 28 ± 12 % after 5 years (FU 20 %). No significant differences in %TBWL were found between SAL RYGB and LAL RYGB during the study period. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.13, 9 % overall short-term complication rate and 19 % cumulative long-term complication rate. No differences in complications were found between SAL and LAL RYGB patients. CONCLUSION Lengthening of the alimentary limb from 100 to 150 cm did not affect post-RYGB weight loss. Overall complication rates were low and comparable in this series of RYGB patients.","Dogan, Kemal; Homan, Jens; Aarts, Edo O; van Laarhoven, Cees J H M; Janssen, Ignace M C; Berends, Frits J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5188-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27553795/,448

81505,Reply by Authors.,2016,"CONTEXT Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is associated with elevated serotonin, diarrhea, flushing, and increased risk of valvular heart disease. Many patients respond to somatostatin analogs initially, but response diminishes in most patients. Additional options are needed. OBJECTIVE To assess whether telotristat etiprate (TE) can reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in CS and reduce urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (u5-HIAA; a biomarker of serotonin). DESIGN A prospective, exploratory, dose-escalating 12-week, open-label, multicenter study of TE with efficacy and safety analyses. SETTING A multicenter study. PATIENTS Eligible patients had metastatic, well-differentiated, neuroendocrine tumors and CS with ≥ four bowel movements (BMs) per day. Somatostatin analog use was allowed. INTERVENTIONS TE, a novel oral inhibitor of peripheral serotonin synthesis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary: safety. Secondary: daily BMs, stool form, and u5-HIAA. RESULTS Fifteen patients were enrolled, and 14 completed the treatment period. All patients experienced reductions in BMs per day (mean decrease, 43.5%). A 74.2% mean reduction in u5-HIAA, the main metabolite of serotonin, was observed, with generally greater reductions in patients with greater reductions in BMs per day. Nine patients (75%) reported ""adequate relief"" of gastrointestinal symptoms at 12 weeks, compared with two (17%) at baseline. Stool form and flushing also improved. Adverse events were mostly gastrointestinal (n = 10; 67%), consistent with underlying illness; three adverse events were serious (abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis) but were judged unrelated. CONCLUSION TE was generally safe and well tolerated. Patients experienced substantial improvement in CS and reductions in u5-HIAA, consistent with the mechanism of action of TE. These results support further evaluation in phase 3 studies.","Pavel, Marianne; Hörsch, Dieter; Caplin, Martyn; Ramage, John; Seufferlein, Thomas; Valle, Juan; Banks, Phillip; Lapuerta, Pablo; Sands, Arthur; Zambrowicz, Brian; Fleming, Douglas; Wiedenmann, Bertram",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-2247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636046/,448

Heated high-flow oxygen delivered through a nasal cannula (HHFNC) is one such intervention that can be delivered in the hospital yet is rarely available outside of this setting. During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, health care systems continue to face the possibility of rationing critical life-sustaining equipment that may include HHFNC. We present a clinical protocol designed for weaning HHFNC to allow a natural death and ensuring adequate symptom management throughout the process. This was a retrospective chart review of 8 patients seen by an inpatient palliative care service of an academic tertiary referral hospital who underwent terminal weaning of HHFNC using a structured protocol to manage dyspnea. Eight patients with diverse medical diagnoses, including COVID-19 pneumonia, underwent terminal weaning of HHFNC according to the clinical protocol with 4 down-titrations of approximately 25% for both fraction of inspired oxygen and liter flow with preemptive boluses of opioid and benzodiazepine. Clinical documentation supported good symptom control throughout the weaning process. This case series provides preliminary evidence that the clinical protocol proposed has the ability to ensure comfort through terminal weaning of HHFNC.","Brackett, Hareklia; Forman, Andrea; Foster, Laura A; Fischer, Stacy M",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081632/,448

Methods We studied synchronous (video visit) and asynchronous (store-and-forward, patient-portal evaluation, remote monitoring) TN utilization in the Mount Sinai Health System Neurology Department in New York, 2 months before and after the start of our department's response to the pandemic in mid-March 2020. Weekly division meetings enabled ongoing assessments and analysis of barriers and facilitators according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change models. We used postvisit surveys of clinicians (from April 13 to May 15, 2020) and patients (from May 11 to 15, 2020) to determine technology platforms used, and TN experience and acceptability, using Likert scales (1 = very poor/unlikely to 5 = very good/likely). Results Over the 4-month period, 117 TN clinicians (n = 14 subspecialties) conducted 4,225 TN visits with 3,717 patients (52 pre- vs 4,173 post-COVID-19). No asynchronous TN services were delivered. Post-COVID-19, the number of TN clinicians, subspecialties performing TN, and visits increased by 963%, 133%, and 7,925%, respectively. Mean acceptability among patients and clinicians was 4.7 (SD 0.6) and 3.4 (SD 1.6), respectively. Most video visits were completed using Epic MyChart (78.5%) and Zoom (8.1%). TN implementation facilitators included Medicare geographic restriction waivers, development of clinician educational materials, and MyChart outreach programs for patients experiencing technical difficulties. Conclusions A significant expansion of TN utilization accompanied the COVID-19 response. Patients found TN more acceptable than did clinicians. Proactive application of an implementation framework facilitated rapid and effective TN expansion.","Kummer, Benjamin R; Sweetnam, Chloe; Vickrey, Barbara G; Naasan, Georges; Harvey, Dayneen; Gallagher, Kimberly; Jetté, Nathalie",Neurology.

84303,"Pseudogynecomastia after massive weight loss: detectability of technique, patient satisfaction, and classification.",2008,"Integrins are involved in the binding and internalization of both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. By using 3 distinct cell systems-CHO cells lacking expression of alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin, HeLa cells treated with siRNA to alpha(5)-integrin, and mouse beta(1)-integrin knockout fibroblasts, we show that alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin is required for efficient infection by pseudovirions bearing the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). These integrins are necessary for viral entry but not for binding or internalization. Given the need for endosomal cathepsins B and L (CatB and CatL) to prime GPs for fusion, we investigated the status of CatB and CatL in integrin-positive and integrin-negative cell lines. Alpha(5)beta(1)-Integrin-deficient cells lacked the double-chain (DC) forms of CatB and CatL, and this correlated with decreased CatL activity in integrin-negative CHO cells. These data indicate that alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin-negative cells may be refractory to infection by GP pseudovirions because they lack the necessary priming machinery (the double-chain forms of CatB and CatL). In support of this model, we show that GP pseudovirions that have been preprimed in vitro to generate the 19-kDa form of GP overcome the requirement for alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin for infection. These results provide further support for the requirement for endosomal cathepsins for ebolavirus infection, identify the DC forms of these cathepsins as previously unrecognized factors that contribute to cell tropism of this virus, and reveal a previously undescribed role for integrins during viral entry as regulators of endosomal cathepsins, which are required to prime the entry proteins of ebolavirus and other pathogenic viruses.","Schornberg, Kathryn L; Shoemaker, Charles J; Dube, Derek; Abshire, Michelle Y; Delos, Sue E; Bouton, Amy H; White, Judith M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0807578106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416892/,448

For the purpose of this review, self-direction refers to the organization and/or coordination of your own life, including professional and other care, with the objective of having what you perceive to be a good life. The aim of this systematic review was to assess and describe interventions that aim to improve self-direction of people with dementia. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Library. Empirical studies up to April 2020 were included that used qualitative and/or quantitative methods and reported on interventions for people with dementia aimed at improving self-direction. Stepwise study selection and the assessment of methodological quality were conducted independently by two authors. Data on study and intervention characteristics, outcomes related to self-direction and well-being of people with dementia and factors influencing the feasibility were extracted systematically and described narratively. RESULTS Ten studies were identified describing a total of nine interventions. Interventions varied in terms of goals, content, target population and duration. Overall, interventions consisted of multiple components focusing on identifying ""Who am I?"" (beliefs, strengths, values, goals), identifying ""What is important to me?"" (meaningful activities and goal setting) and/or communicating about preferences with professionals and/or caregivers. The review provides indications that people with dementia may benefit from the interventions included. Overall, positive effects were found in studies on outcomes related to self-direction and wellbeing. However, outcomes measured using quantitative methods showed inconsistent effects between the studies. CONCLUSIONS Although the methodological quality of all the studies included was 'good' or at least 'fair', the evidence base of interventions aiming to improve self-direction is still limited due to the low number of studies, the low number of participants and the frequent use of and their authors' own non-standardized measures. Nevertheless, the review points towards positive effects on self-direction and well-being. Identifying individual beliefs, strengths, values, goals and meaningful activities can be essential components of these interventions, as well as communication about the desired care and support.","Döpp, Carola M E; Drenth, Hermijntje; Verkade, Paul-Jeroen; Francke, Anneke F; van der Heide, Iris",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02133-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743599/,448
91486,Why does continuity of care with family doctors matter? Review and qualitative synthesis of patient and physician perspectives.,2021-09-01,"Enteral nutrition (EN) is commonly interrupted in burn patients for many reasons, which leads to discrepancies between prescribed and actual EN delivery. The magnitude and origin of these discrepancies have never been well documented among burn patients. The purpose of this study was to examine differences between prescribed and actual EN delivery and to identify the specific causes of EN interruption and to quantify these. Retrospective review of patients treated between June 6, 2009 and June 6, 2012 at an adult regional American Burn Association-verified burn center who had ≥10% TBSA burns and who were prescribed EN for at least 24 hours. On postburn days (PBD) 0 to 14 the daily volume of EN prescribed by the dietitian was compared with the actual volume received by the patient. The cause and duration of interruptions to EN delivery were recorded. A total of 90 subjects, [mean (± SD) age 47 ± 18 years, 32% female, median %TBSA burn size 28, median %TBSA full-thickness burn size 11, and a 54% incidence of inhalation injury], were studied. EN was initiated at a median of 9.5 hours after burn center admission. Received calories were significantly less than prescribed calories on every study day. The median daily caloric deficit ranged between 172 and 930 kcal. The median percent of prescribed calories received each day ranged from 19% on PBD 0 to 91% on PBD 14. The mean (± SD) total duration of EN interruption was 8.9 ± 3.0 hours per day. Gradually increasing the feed rate to reach the prescribed EN goal rate (""ramping-in"") was the most common cause of a discrepancy between prescribed and actual EN delivery, accounting for 35% of total discrepancy time. Interruptions for surgery accounted for 24% of total discrepancy time. Other causes of discrepancies were physician- or nurse-directed interruptions (16% of time), planned extubation (7%), feed intolerance (11%), tube malfunction (2%), bedside procedures (2%), and dressing changes (3%).Enterally fed burn patients received significantly less nutrition than prescribed. Some of the causes for discrepancies between prescribed and received EN are unavoidable, but many are not, suggesting the need for careful review and possible alteration of existing EN practices.","Sudenis, Tess; Hall, Kathryn; Cartotto, Robert",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0000000000000069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722665/,448

94940,Technical Refinements in Autologous Hand Rejuvenation.,2015,"BACKGROUND Three different data sources exist for monitoring COVID-19-associated hospitalisations in Norway: The Directorate of Health, the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry (NIPaR), and the linking of the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). A comparison of results from different data sources is important to increase understanding of the data and to further optimise current and future surveillance. We compared results from the three data sources from March to June 2020. MATERIAL AND METHOD We analysed the number of new admissions, as well as the total number of hospitalised patients and those on ventilatory support, reported per day and by regional health authority. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS The cumulative number of new admissions according to NPR-MSIS (n=1260) was higher than NIPaR (n=1153). The discrepancy was high early in the epidemic (93 as of 29 March). The trend in the number of hospitalised patients was similar for all three sources throughout the study period. NPR-MSIS overestimated the number of hospitalised patients on ventilatory support. INTERPRETATION The discrepancy in new admissions between NIPaR and NPR-MSIS is primarily due to missing registrations for some patients admitted before NIPaR became operational. Basic information retrieved daily by the Directorate of Health give comparable results to more comprehensive daily information retrieval undertaken in NIPaR and NPR-MSIS, adjusted retrospectively. Further analysis is necessary regarding whether NIPaR and NPR-MSIS provide timely data and function as required in an emergency preparedness situation.","Whittaker, Robert; Grøsland, Mari; Buanes, Eirik Alnes; Beitland, Sigrid; Bryhn, Bente; Helgeland, Jon; Sjøflot, Olav Isak; Berild, Jacob Dag; Seppälä, Elina; Tønnessen, Ragnhild; Telle, Kjetil","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322870/,448

Decentralization of testing can put tremendous stresses on fragile health systems if the laboratory is not involved in the planning, introduction, and scale-up strategies. RECENT FINDINGS The impact of investments in novel technologies can only be realized if these tests are evaluated, adopted, and scaled up within the healthcare system with appropriate planning and understanding of the local contexts in which these technologies will be used. SUMMARY In this digital age, the laboratory needs to take on the role of the Command Centre for technology introduction and implementation. Implementation science is needed to understand the political, cultural, economic, and behavioural context for technology introduction. The new paradigm should include: building a comprehensive system of laboratories and point-of-care testing sites to provide quality-assured diagnostic services with good laboratory-clinic interface to build trust in test results and linkage to care; building and coordinating a comprehensive national surveillance and communication system for disease control and global health emergencies; conducting research to monitor the impact of new tools and interventions on improving patient care.","Boeras, Debrah I; Nkengasong, John N; Peeling, Rosanna W",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079592/,448

PM2.5 samples were collected using mid-volume samplers during the autumn of 2017 in all six cities. The samples were analyzed to determine the ambient PM2.5 compositions, including the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), carbonaceous aerosols, and elements concentrations. The chemical ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon and nitrate to sulfate as well as the enrichment factors of elements were calculated to establish the possible sources of PM2.5 in all six cities. The highest PM2.5 concentration was 152 μg/m3 in SJZ, while the lowest concentration was 47 μg/m3 in HRB. During the sampling period in these six cities, the PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization recommended daily average air quality guidelines by 2.4-6.1 times, and WSIIs, carbonaceous aerosols, and elements accounted for 31.8%-61.6%, 9.8%-35.1%, and 0.9%-2.5% of the PM2.5, respectively. In 2013, the Chinese government formulated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) for controlling air pollution, and effective measures have been implemented since then. Compared with previous studies conducted during 2009-2013 before the implementation of the APPCAP, the concentrations of PM2.5 and most of its components decreased to varying degrees, and large changes in the chemical ratios of PM2.5 components were observed. These results indicate that PM2.5 sources vary among these six cities and that China has improved the ambient air quality in these cities through the implementation of air pollution control policies. The APPCAP have achieved considerable results in continuously reducing pollution concentrations, although the air pollution concentrations observed in this study remain high compared with those of other countries.","Wang, Qiong; Fang, Jianlong; Shi, Wanying; Dong, Xiaoyan",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818727/,448

The first response of states to the COVID-19 outbreak was to impose lock-down and social barrier measures, such as wearing a surgical mask or social distancing. One of the consequences of this pandemic in terms of public health was the suspension or slowdown of infant vaccination campaigns, in almost all countries. The indirect effects of COVID-19 may therefore weigh on mortality from measles and polio in developing countries. In this pandemic chaos, the only hope lies in the rapid development of an effective vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

112878,Use of SERI Surgical Scaffold for Soft-tissue Support in a Massive Weight Loss Patient.,2013,"BACKGROUND The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) comprises a complex molecular cascade with two counter-regulatory axes, the classical and the alternative. Angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7), the main peptides of the RAS, exert opposite effects in multiple organs and systems, including the cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary and immune systems. Strong evidence supports the hypothesis of a local RAS in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and its modulatory roles in neuroendocrinology and neurotransmission. OBJECTIVE In this narrative review, we provide a comprehensive approach on experimental and clinical data regarding RAS molecules expression and possible roles in physiology and physiopathology of CNS diseases. METHODS This non-systematic review summarizes evidence on RAS implications in CNS diseases and its possible relationships with COVID-19. RESULTS We divided the possible RAS mechanisms in distinct conditions during lifespan, approaching from congenital infections to neurodegenerative alterations, passing through mood disorders and cerebrovascular diseases. We also gathered current evidence about the possible effects of RAS in Covid-19, particularly the described cases that course with neurological manifestations. CONCLUSION Although there are limitations and controversies, the analysis of RAS mechanisms in the CNS certainly represents an interesting field of research. However, further investigation is necessary to support the noteworthy interactions and provide a better comprehension of the cross-talk between RAS and the CNS. Investigations in this research field may shed lights to novel therapeutic targets.","Lanza, Katharina; Dias, Raphael; Dos Santos Oliveira, Rafaela; Belotto, Luís; Miranda, Aline Silva; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210212101854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583366/,448

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, have been suggested as potential mechanisms linking the intrauterine environment with offspring health status. The present systematic review compiles peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of maternal nutritional interventions on DNA methylation patterns of the offspring. The results of the included trials are consistent with micronutrient supplementation not significantly affecting offspring tissue DNA methylation patterns, yet subgrouping by sex, BMI, and smoking status increased the significance of nutritional supplementation on DNA methylation. Maternal BMI and smoking status as well as offspring sex were factors influencing offspring DNA methylation responsiveness to nutritional interventions during pregnancy. Future research should aim at assessing the impact of nutritional interventions on DNA methylation patterns of neonates comparing single versus multi-micronutrient supplementation, within populations having high versus low baseline nutritional statuses.","Andraos, Stephanie; de Seymour, Jamie Violet; O'Sullivan, Justin Martin; Kussmann, Martin",Molecular nutrition & food research,https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201800034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30035846/,448

In this study, a murine model of renal ischemia/reperfusion was established to investigate the repairing effect and mechanism of miR-101a-3p on renal injury. The pathological damage of renal tissue was observed by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining. The levels of miR-101, profibrotic cytokines, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were analyzed using Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and/or immunofluorescence. MiR-101 overexpression caused the downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin, collagen-1, and vimentin, as well as upregulation of E-cadherin, thereby alleviating the degree of renal tissue damage. MiR-101 overexpression mitigated hypoxic HK-2 cell damage. Collagen, type X, alpha 1 and transforming growth factor β receptor 1 levels were downregulated in hypoxic cells transfected with miR-101 mimic.

115986,Reply by Authors.,2019,"OBJECTIVES Previous studies have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was associated with the physical and psychological stress of those infected. However, research is sparse regarding the long-term health consequence of community SARS exposure for older adults. METHODS Using data from the 2011 and 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we estimated multilevel regression models of allostatic load in the years after the SARS epidemic among 7735 respondents. Interaction terms between SARS epidemic exposure and social participation or community environment were included to examine potential effects. RESULTS We found that community SARS exposure was associated with greater allostatic load for those who had no social participation. Among those who were in worse community environment, community SARS exposure was strongly related to elevated load in the cardiovascular system. However, for those had social participation and lived in better community environment, community SARS exposure manifested no association with allostatic load years later. Active social participation and better community environment could offset the negative association between SARS exposure and allostatic load. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these findings helped determine the positive direction of future social efforts and policy decisions to guide the global recovery from the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.

The vaccine preparation was tested with or without adjuvants. Adjuvant Systems AS01(B) and AS03(A) were selected and tested for their capacity to elicit high humoral and cellular immune responses to WI-SARS vaccine. We evaluated the effect of vaccine dose and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect of vaccine dose with or without the AS01(B) adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters. Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination). A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, even in the absence of adjuvant. The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS01(B)-adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS03(A)-adjuvanted vaccine. Two doses of WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice. In hamsters, two doses of WI-SARS with and without AS01(B) were immunogenic, and two doses of 2 μg of WI-SARS with and without the adjuvant provided complete protection from early challenge. Although antibody titers had declined in all groups of vaccinated hamsters 18 wk after the second dose, the vaccinated hamsters were still partially protected from wild-type virus challenge. Vaccine with adjuvant provided better protection than non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine at this later time point. Enhanced disease was not observed in the lungs or liver of hamsters following SARS-CoV challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.","Roberts, Anjeanette; Lamirande, Elaine W; Vogel, Leatrice; Baras, Benoît; Goossens, Geneviève; Knott, Isabelle; Chen, Jun; Ward, Jerrold M; Vassilev, Ventzislav; Subbarao, Kanta",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2010.0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883165/,448

METHODS From January 2012 through April 2014, a total of 7 patients with spinal dural AVFs in the thoracic region underwent open microsurgical obliteration at Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital. The microvascular anatomy of spinal dural AVFs was comprehensively assessed by using advanced microangiography, including 3D computer graphics and intraoperative indocyanine green video angiography, and by histological findings. RESULTS The 2 microangiography techniques revealed the spatial course and in vivo blood flow of the meningeal vessels and their relationships with the dura mater in sufficient detail. The meningeal branch of the intercostal artery split into multiple meningeal vessels on the outer dural surface adjacent to the root sleeve. After crossing the dura mater to the inner dural surface, these vessels gathered and joined a single intradural draining vessel. On the inner dural surface, the single draining vessel was fed by the surrounding multiple meningeal vessels, which appeared to be caput medusae. Histological findings revealed that the structure of the meningeal branch of the intercostal artery corresponded to that of a normal artery. The structure of intradural draining vessels corresponded to that of a vein modified by retrograde arterial inflow. On the inner dural surface, more than 1 meningeal artery gathered and joined with the proximal radiculomedullary vein. CONCLUSIONS Spinal dural AVFs are located on the inner dural surface, where multiple direct AV connections between more than 1 meningeal feeding artery and a single proximal radiculomedullary vein occur at the site where the vein connects to the dura mater.","Takai, Keisuke; Komori, Takashi; Taniguchi, Makoto",Journal of neurosurgery.

METHODS Online databases were used to identify studies published between 2013-2019, from which we selected 747 articles that involved survivors of acute physical traumatic injury aged 18 or older at time of injury and used PROMs to evaluate recovery between six months and 10 years post-injury. Data was extracted and summarized using descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis of the results. RESULTS Most studies were observational, with relatively small sample sizes, and predominantly on traumatic brain injury or orthopedic patients. The number of PROs assessed per study varied from one to 12, for a total of 2052 PROs extracted, yielding 74 unique constructs [physical health: 25 (34%), mental health: 27 (37%), social health: 12 (16%), cognitive health: 7 (10%), and quality of life: 3 (4%)]. These 74 constructs were assessed using 355 different PROMs. Mental health was the most frequently examined outcome domain followed by physical health. Health-related quality of life, which appeared in more than half of the studies (n=401), was the most common PRO evaluated, followed by depressive symptoms. Physical health was the domain with the highest number of PROMs used (N= 157), and lower extremity functionality was the PRO that contributed most PROMs (N=33). CONCLUSION We identified a wide variety of PROMs available to track long-term PROs after injury in five different health domains: physical, mental, social, cognitive, and quality of life. However, efforts to fully understand the health outcomes of trauma patients remain inconsistent and insufficient. Defining PROs that should be prioritized and standardizing the PROMs to measure them will facilitate the incorporation of long-term outcomes in national registries to improve research and quality of care.

133329,Are Prophylactic Postoperative Antibiotics Necessary after Masculinizing Mastectomy with Free Nipple Graft? A Single-institution Retrospective Review.,2020-01-01,"BACKGROUND Low molecular weight carrageenan (Cg) is a seaweed-derived sulfated polysaccharide widely used as inflammatory stimulus in preclinical studies. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cg-induced inflammation are not fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular basis involved in Cg-induced macrophages activation and cytokines production. METHODS Primary culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Kappa Cg. The supernatant and cell lysate were used for ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence. Cg-induced mouse colitis was also developed. RESULTS Here we show that Cg activates peritoneal macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1β. While Cg-induced TNF production/secretion depends on TLR4/MyD88 signaling, the production of pro-IL-1β relies on TLR4/TRIF/SYK/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. The maturation of pro-IL1β into IL-1β is dependent on canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Pannexin-1/P2X7/K+ efflux signaling. In vivo, Cg-induced colitis was reduced in mice in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome components. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we unravel a critical role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in Cg-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and colitis, which is an important discovery on the pro-inflammatory properties of this sulfated polysaccharide for pre-clinical studies. Video abstract Carrageenan (Cg) is one the most used flogistic stimulus in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of Cg-induced inflammation is not totally elucidated. Herein, Lopes et al. unraveled the molecular basis for Cg-induced macrophages production of biological active IL-1β.

Taxonomic position of Pachynomidae has been debated for a long time. Knowledge about mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of this family also remain limited. In the present study, we describe the complete mitogenome of Camarochiloides weiweii, the first mitogenome sequenced for this family. This mitogenome consists of 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes and 21 tRNA genes. Two tRNA gene rearrangements in this genome, including the translocation of trnA and trnR as well as the transposition of trnH, were observed and could be explained by the tandem duplication-random loss (TDRL) model. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses based on sequences of three different mitogenomic datasets recovered the monophyly of Reduvioidea, and the sister relationship between Reduvioidea and the remaining Cimicomorpha lineages. This study enlightens the future application of mitogenomic data in the phylogenetic study of Cimicomorpha based on the large-scale sampling.","Chen, Zhuo; Liu, Yingqi; Wu, Yunfei; Song, Fan; Cai, Wanzhi; Li, Hu",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069822/,448

METHODS A cross-sectional randomised experimental survey was conducted among 3247 adult (aged 18+ years) participants in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2017, using quotas for age group, gender and smoking status. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four HWL themes. Each participant viewed eight HWLs and rated how effective these themed-labels were in terms of credibility, raising awareness of health harms of smoking on family and children, improving compliance with public smoking bans, stopping the practice of gifting cigarettes, thinking about quitting and preventing smoking using a 10-point scale, with 10 being most effective. Analysis of variance and independent t-tests were used to analyse these data. FINDINGS All four HWL themes performed well for each outcome with average ratings >6.5. Harming family or children with secondhand smoke was the theme that received the highest ratings for each outcome, with credibility (8.0, 95% CI 7.86 to 8.09) and prevention of smoking (8.8, 95% CI 8.63 to 8.91) outcomes being significantly higher (p<0.05). Overall, analysis of ratings by gender, income and education did not impact outcomes. CONCLUSION All four HWL themes tested could be effective in China; the theme of secondhand smoke harming family or children may be a particularly credible/effective theme.","Nian, Qinghua; Hardesty, Jeffrey J; Cohen, Joanna E; Xie, Xiangqiang; Kennedy, Ryan David",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2021-056703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400570/,448

An important example is beta-casomorphins, which are opioid peptides derived from A1 beta-casein in bovine milk and have been associated to be risk factors for non-communicable diseases in humans. A1 and A2 beta-casein are different with respect to the release of bioactive peptides, in particular BCM-7. However, evidence from human studies is limited and could be complemented with evidence derived from animal studies. We conducted a scoping review to identify animal studies investigating the effects of A1 beta-casein or BCM-7 compared to A2 beta-casein or any other intervention on health-related outcomes. METHODS We systematically searched for relevant studies in two electronic databases (Medline, Embase; last search performed March 2020). Two reviewers independently undertook study selection and data extraction of included references. Results were summarized tabularly and narratively. RESULTS We included 42 studies investigating various animal models, including rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs. Six studies investigated health-related outcomes of A1- vs. A2 milk, while most studies (n = 36) reported on physiological properties (e.g., analgesic effect) of BCM-7 as an opioid peptide. Included studies were extremely heterogeneous in terms of the study population, type of intervention and dose, and type of outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Only a few studies comparing the effects of A1- and A2 milk were identified. More studies addressing this research question in animal models are needed to provide essential information to inform research gaps. Results from future studies could eventually complement research for humans, particularly when the body of evidence remains uncertain as is the case in the A1- and A2 milk debate.","Kuellenberg de Gaudry, Daniela; Lohner, Szimonetta; Bischoff, Karin; Schmucker, Christine; Hoerrlein, Simone; Roeger, Christine; Schwingshackl, Lukas; Meerpohl, Joerg J",European journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02551-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075432/,448
144482,Transgender and Gender-nonbinary Patient Satisfaction after Transmasculine Chest Surgery.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND As part of community-based initiatives to strengthen integrated care and promote patient recovery, GPs are asked to play a greater part in treating serious mental disorder (SMD) patients. All current healthcare reforms favour the reinforcement of primary care. More information on enhancing the role of GPs in mental health would benefit policymakers, especially as regards SMD patients, where little research has been published as yet. This article assesses variables associated with GPs taking on SMD patients. METHODS The study, encompassing multiple sites, is based on a sample of 398 GPs, representative of the GP population in the Canadian province of Quebec. GPs were asked to answer a 143-item questionnaire on their socio-demographic and clinical practice profiles, patient characteristics, perceived inter-professional relationships and quality of care. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Our data highlighted that GPs currently followed up only a minority of SMD patients on a continuous basis and far fewer for both physical and mental health problems. A linear regression model that accounts for 43% of the variance was generated. The best variables associated positively with GPs taking on SMD patients were: frequency of referrals for joint follow-up with other resources, and involvement in post-hospitalization follow-up. Conversely, lack of expertise in mental health (related in our model to frequency of mental disorder patient transfer due to insufficient mental health training) is associated with a lower incidence of GPs taking on patients. CONCLUSION As advocated in current healthcare reforms, our study confirms the need to promote greater GP involvement in integrated care models and enhance their training in mental health--thereby helping to reverse the trend among GPs of transferring SMD patients to specialized care. Patients with stable SMDs ought to have the same care access as the general population.","Fleury, Marie-Josée; Bamvita, Jean-Marie; Tremblay, Jacques",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2296-10-41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515248/,448

Objective: To study symptoms and symptom relief during the last week of life, comparing nursing homes with hospitals. Design: The Swedish Register of Palliative Care with national coverage was used. Breakthrough symptoms were registered as Yes/No. Symptom relief was recorded on a 3-grade scale as complete-partial-no relief. All deaths in COVID-19 were contrasted to deaths in a reference population (deaths 2019). Deaths at nursing homes were compared with deaths in hospitals. Setting and Subjects: All deaths in hospitals or nursing homes (n = 490) were analyzed. Deaths in other settings (specialized palliative care wards [n = 11], in palliative home care [n = 2], or in their own homes [n = 8]) were excluded (n = 21). Only patients with expected deaths (n = 390) were entered in the final analysis. Results: Breathlessness as a breakthrough symptom was more common in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 reference population (p < 0.001) and relief of breathlessness, as well as anxiety, delirium, and death rattles was less successful in COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01 in different comparisons). Patients were older in nursing homes than in hospitals (86.6 years vs. 80.9 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (48% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Breakthrough of breathlessness was much more frequently reported in hospital settings than in nursing homes, 73% versus 35% (p < 0.0001), and complete relief was more rarely possible in hospitals, 20% versus 42% (p < 0.01). The proportion of partial relief+complete relief was comparable, 92% versus 95% (ns). Also, anxiety and pain were more often completely relieved in nursing homes (p < 0.01 in both comparisons). Conclusion: The lower symptom prevalence in nursing homes may be explained by elderly frail residents dying already in the first phase of the COVID-19 disease, before acute respiratory distress syndrome develops.","Strang, Peter; Bergström, Jonas; Lundström, Staffan",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746685/,448

BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery disease with nitinol self-expanding stents is associated with high rates of in-stent restenosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of diabetic patients to investigate whether post-dilation of superficial femoral artery nitinol self-expanding stents using a cryoplasty balloon reduces restenosis compared to a conventional balloon. Inclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, and superficial femoral artery lesions requiring implantation of stents>5 mm in diameter and >60 mm in length. Primary endpoint was binary restenosis at 12 months, defined as ≥2.5-fold increase in peak systolic velocity by duplex ultrasonography. RESULTS Seventy-four patients, with 90 stented superficial femoral artery lesions, were randomly assigned to post-dilation using cryoplasty (n=45 lesions) or conventional balloons (n=45 lesions). Mean lesion length was 148±98 mm, mean stented length was 190±116 mm, mean stent diameter was 6.1±0.4 mm, and 50% of the lesions were total occlusions. Post-dilation balloon diameters were 5.23±0.51 mm versus 5.51±0.72 mm in the cryoplasty and conventional balloon angioplasty groups, respectively (p=0.02). At 12 months, binary restenosis was significantly lower in the cryoplasty group (29.3% vs. 55.8%, p=0.01; odds ratio: 0.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.89). CONCLUSIONS Among diabetic patients undergoing implantation of nitinol self-expanding stents in the superficial femoral artery, post-dilation with cryoplasty balloon reduced binary restenosis compared to conventional balloon angioplasty.

153007,Reply by Authors.,2019,"As angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) was identified as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, there have been many reports concerning its role in several tissues, including the kidney. However, the role of ACE2 during the development of diabetic nephropathy remains undetermined, as previous reports did not necessarily support a protective role against renal injury. Thus, we performed detailed observations of kidneys in ACE2-knockout (ACE2-KO) mice at early (4 weeks) and advanced (18 weeks) stages of diabetes. ACE2-KO and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed earlier onset and more severe progression of albuminuria than those did wild-type mice. The elevation of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels at 18 weeks of diabetes was more prominent in ACE2-KO mice. Periodic acid-Schiff-stained cross-section of diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed a more severe time-dependent increase in glomerular/tubulointerstitial damage than did that of wild-type mice, confirmed by the immunostaining of alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and F4-80 antigen. Glomeruli of diabetic ACE2-KO mice showed earlier and more severe decrease in the expression of nephrin, whose degradation is involved in the onset of albuminuria, and more potent increase of vascular endothelial growth factor expression. In addition, treatment with AT1 receptor blocker olmesartan significantly, but not totally, ameliorated the functional and morphological deterioration of diabetic nephropathy in ACE2-KO mice. These results suggest that ACE2 might continuously protect from both glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury during the development of diabetic nephropathy. The renal-protective effect of ACE2 might involve more than just suppressing angiotensin II-mediated AT1 receptor signaling.","Shiota, Atsushi; Yamamoto, Koichi; Ohishi, Mitsuru; Tatara, Yuji; Ohnishi, Miyuki; Maekawa, Yoshihiro; Iwamoto, Yoshihiro; Takeda, Masao; Rakugi, Hiromi",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/hr.2009.231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186149/,448

184082,Innovative collaborations are improving mental health care.,2020-10-01,"Infrared imaging of the colliding-wind binary Apep has revealed a spectacular dust plume with complicated internal dynamics that challenges standard colliding-wind binary physics. Such challenges can be potentially resolved if a rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system, implicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. One of the difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that the spectral composition of the stars in the system was unclear. Here we present visual to near-infrared spectra that demonstrate that the central component of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon- (WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes. We argue that such an assignment represents the strongest case of a classical WR+WR binary system in the Milky Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be $2100 \pm 200$ and $3500 \pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. If the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of the colliding winds is expected to be $\approx$ 0.4. Since the expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind velocity consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star produces a significantly slow equatorial wind with a velocity of $\approx$530 km s$^{-1}$. Such slow wind speeds can be driven by near-critical rotation of a Wolf-Rayet star.","Callingham, J. R.; Crowther, P. A.; Williams, P. M.; Tuthill, P. G.; Han, Y.; Pope, B. J.

A standardized, confidential, self-administered, close-ended questionnaire was used to assess respondents' knowledge, attitudes, self-reported practices, perception and behaviors toward cross-infection control measures in dental clinics. 71.4% (n 407) of participants were females and 28.6% (n 163) were males. 72.6%, 63.2%, and 62.5% of respondents agreed that they can catch during dental treatment HCV, HBV and AIDS/HIV respectively, while 50.5% and 55.8% mentioned about TB and respiratory infectious (RI) diseases respectively. 80% of participants are concerned about the risk to be infected during the dental treatment. 62.5% of participants responded that they would not receive treatment in dental clinic where HIV and HBV/HCV patients are being treated. Overall, the study suggests that participants' knowledge, attitude and perception regarding cross-infection control in dentistry need some improvements. This study will assist in planning more effective interventions to enhance public awareness about infection control in dentistry in Georgia.","Chitaladze, T; Kazakhashvili, N",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526748/,448

HPV transcription varies within the different layers of the epithelium. The correlation between HPV transcription patterns and disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Understanding these patterns is critical to designing and testing new HPV-specific therapeutic strategies. We examined HPV gene expression in homogenous populations of cells microdissected from the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, and stratum corneum of lesions from the transgenic mice using PALM microlaser technology. RNA extracted from each cell layer was subjected to two-step gene-specific RT-PCR and real-time quantitative nested PCR. To ensure specific amplification of spliced transcripts, the primers used for real-time nested PCR spanned the splice sites. High levels of E2 were detected in the basal and supra-basal layers of hyperplastic and dysplastic lesions. E7 and E6* levels increased significantly over time in stratum basale and stratum spinosum. E6** was expressed at much lower levels. We showed that the transgenic mice express correctly spliced E2 transcripts and are suitable as a preclinical model to test a therapeutic strategy using transcriptional regulation by the E2 protein.","Sethi, Neerja; Palefsky, Joel",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15180960/,448

Three of these clones, which contain the complete sequences of mRNA A for both strains, except for the leader sequences which are only present on the subgenomic messenger RNAs, have been sequenced using the dideoxy method. The sequences are similar for both strains, each containing a single long open reading frame of 1227 bases which predicts a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 45 000. The genome position and size of this predicted polypeptide are consistent with it being the gene for the nucleocapsid protein. The amino acid sequence shows considerable homology with those of the nucleocapsids of murine hepatitis virus strains A59 and JHM. The major difference between the sequences determined for the two IBV strains is that the 3' non-coding region of the Beaudette strain contains a 184 base segment which is not present in the M41 strain.","Boursnell, M E; Binns, M M; Foulds, I J; Brown, T D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2983001/,448

This study measured public health workers' opinions on disaster preparedness, assessed workers' likelihood of reporting to various types of disasters, and evaluated conditions that will encourage workers to report to work. A focus group and literature search were conducted to inform a survey that would assess attitudes about disasters. Frequencies were calculated on survey responses. Most respondents believed other employees could perform their jobs during a disaster; however, fewer than two thirds thought their coworkers would report to work under such circumstances. Fewer than three fourths of respondents would report to work during an emergency involving a known chemical, an unknown biological, a radiological, a biological incurable, or an unknown chemical agent. These results indicate training gaps that should be addressed in future training sessions at the two health departments surveyed.","DeSimone, Cristi L",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248746/,448

METHODS An abdominal hernia rabbit model was used to evaluate retraction, solidity, and elasticity of the principal types of PP prostheses currently available, i.e., three large pore size monofilament prostheses, one heavy weight (HWPP), a second low weight (LWPP), and a third coated with atelocollagen (CPP). A small pore size multifilament PP (MPP) implant was also tested. RESULTS In comparison with HWPP (12%), LWPP (15%), and MPP (30%), CPP had less retraction (8% of the original size). Unlike pore size, weight prosthesis is not an influencing factor for retraction. Atelocollagen coating reduced retraction. HWPP and MPP were the most solid prostheses. MPP supported the greatest elastic force. CONCLUSIONS When the biomechanical parameters were comparatively assessed, HWPP was considered to have the most advantageous properties for prolapse surgery.","Sergent, Fabrice; Desilles, Nicolas; Lacoume, Yann; Bunel, Claude; Marie, Jean-Paul; Marpeau, Loïc",International urogynecology journal and pelvic floor dysfunction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221679/,448
193051,How infectious disease outbreaks affect community-based primary care physicians: comparing the SARS and H1N1 epidemics.,2014,"OBJECTIVE With the increasing number of aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling, more recurrences are being encountered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of microsurgical clipping in the treatment of recurrent, previously coiled cerebral aneurysms and to identify risk factors that can affect the outcomes of this procedure. METHODS One hundred eleven patients with recurrent aneurysms whose lesions were managed by surgical clipping between January 2002 and October 2014 were identified. The rates of aneurysm occlusion, retreatment, complications, and good clinical outcome were retrospectively determined. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS The mean patient age was 50.5 years, the mean aneurysm size was 7 mm, and 97.3% of aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. The mean follow-up was 22 months. Complete aneurysm occlusion, as assessed by intraoperative angiography, was achieved in 97.3% of aneurysms (108 of 111 patients). Among patients, 1.8% (2 of 111 patients) had a recurrence after clipping. Retreatment was required in 4.5% of patients (5 of 111) after clipping. Major complications were observed in 8% of patients and mortality in 2.7%. Ninety percent of patients had a good clinical outcome. Aneurysm size (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.08-1.7; p = 0.009) and location in the posterior circulation were significantly associated with higher complications. All 3 patients who had coil extraction experienced a postoperative stroke. Aneurysm size (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.02-1.45; p = 0.025) and higher number of interventions prior to clipping (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.3-21.4; p = 0.019) were significant predictors of poor outcome. An aneurysm size > 7 mm was a significant predictor of incomplete obliteration and retreatment (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS Surgical clipping is safe and effective in treating recurrent, previously coiled cerebral aneurysms. Aneurysm size, location, and number of previous coiling procedures are important factors to consider in the management of these aneurysms.","Daou, Badih; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert M; Barros, Guilherme; Ya'qoub, Lina; Do, John; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894462/,448

However, their use can be limited by resistances and allergic reactions. Allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics account for only a small proportion of reported adverse drug reactions, but they are related with an important morbidity, mortality and increase of the health care costs. Drug-specific IgE antibodies cause early reactions, whereas T cells play a predominant role in delayed hypersensitivity reactions. For penicillin a major antigenic determinant and several minor determinants have been identified. Clinical assessment is mandatory by medical history, skin and other testing, including provocation. If the beta-lactam should be avoided or a desensitization procedure should be performed depends on the nature and severity of the reaction. Several new antibiotics are currently available (tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin, etc.) that are as effective and safe as beta-lactams. In this article we have developed a few recommendations for the management of patients with allergy to beta-lactams on the basis of evidence and expert opinion.","Barberán, J; Mensa, J; Fariñas, C; Llinares, P; Olaechea, P; Palomar, M; Torres, Mj; Moreno, E; Serrano, R; García, Ja",Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443934/,448

The aim of this study was to observe the behaviour of FM symptoms during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS Patients who had been diagnosed as having FM for ≥3 months were recruited between February and May 2020. The collected data were age, sex, educational level and marital status; height and weight; and the scores of the revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), the modified Fibromyalgia Assessment Status 2019 (FASmod), and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale (PDS). The patients were divided into those with or without concomitant COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Eight hundred and ninety-seven (93%) of the 965 patients (881 women [91.3%] and 84 men [8.7%]) were followed up on an outpatient basis because of FM and 68 (7.0%) were either followed up as out-patients or hospitalised because of COVID-19. There was no difference in the sociodemographic data of the two groups, but there were statistically significant between-group differences in the results of the clinimetric tests. The major differences between the score of the items (those with the greatest disease impact) were the following related symptoms: sleep quality (FIQR15), fatigue/energy (FIQR13), pain (FIQR12), stiffness (FIQR14). CONCLUSIONS The mean total and subdomain scores of all the tests were significantly higher in the patients with COVID-19, which suggests that global FM symptoms are more severe in patients with infection. Further studies of the post-COVID19 patients are being carried out in order to discover whether the worsened symptomatology continues because of their hypersensitised state.","Salaffi, Fausto; Giorgi, Valeria; Sirotti, Silvia; Bongiovanni, Sara; Farah, Sonia; Bazzichi, Laura; Marotto, Daniela; Atzeni, Fabiola; Rizzi, Maurizio; Batticciotto, Alberto; Lombardi, Giovanni; Galli, Massimo; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200740/,448

The identification of the putative natural reservoir suggests that a re-emergence is possible. The functions of many coronaviral proteins have now been elucidated, resulting in many novel approaches to therapy. OBJECTIVE To review anticoronaviral therapies based on inhibition of viral entry into the host cell and to cast light on promising approaches and future developments. METHOD The published literature, in particular patent publications, is searched for relevant documents. The information is organized and critiqued. RESULTS/CONCLUSION The approaches to combating coronaviral infections are built on the foundation of antivirals against other viruses and the fundamental insights gained by dissection of the coronaviral lifecycle. These approaches include the prevention of viral entry, reviewed here, and interference with the intracellular lifecycle of the virus in the infected cell, reviewed next. Of the viral-entry inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy, clinical application in other viral infections, and the potential to impact a future epidemic.

196929,Choosing our narrative wisely.,2020-08-01,"Renal transplant recipients are susceptible to infection by a wide array of pathogens. Impaired inflammatory responses due to immunosuppressive therapies suppress clinical and radiologic findings engendered by microbial invasion. As a result, patients are often minimally symptomatic and evaluation and diagnosis are delayed. Specific microbiologic diagnosis is essential both for the optimization of antimicrobial therapy and to avoid unnecessary drug toxicities. Differential diagnosis is guided by knowledge of organisms commonly involved in infection in immunocompromised hosts and understanding of the limitations of prophylactic strategies. The risk of infection in the organ transplant recipient is determined by the interaction between the individual's epidemiologic exposures and net state of immunosuppression. Epidemiology includes environmental exposures in the community and hospital, organisms derived from donor tissues and latent infections activated in the host during immune suppression. The net state of immune suppression is determined by the interaction of all factors contributing to infectious risk. Routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is aimed at common infections and unique risk factors in individual patient groups. This includes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (for Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma, most Nocardia and Listeria, common urinary pathogens), perioperative (eg, anti-fungal prophylaxis for pancreas transplants), or antiviral (for herpesviruses in high risk recipients).","Fishman, Jay A",Seminars in nephrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17616276/,448

METHODS Sixteen domestic pigs (8 per group) underwent thermoablations. Group A consisted of 8 pigs in which microwave left lateral liver resection was performed. Group B consisted of 8 pigs which underwent left lateral liver resection by the Aquamantys system. After 28 days of close follow-up, the animals were sacrificed in order to study the macroscopic and microscopic findings of each intervention on the liver edge. RESULTS An average of 47.13 min was enough for the entire operation to take place using Aquamantys, whereas an average of 59.13 min was needed in the microwave liver resection group. Mean blood loss was 40 ml (range 5-85) with Aquamantys whereas mean blood loss was 72.37 ml (range 42-100) using microwave. Postoperative complications rates were extremely low in both groups. There was no intra- or postoperative mortality.

Inconsistencies of the infectious disease model as it applies to the spongiform encephalopathies may result in failure of these policies. METHODS Review of historical, political and scientific literature to determine the appropriate disease model of spongiform encephalopathy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Spongiform encephalopathy has always occurred sporadically in man and other animals. Hippocrates may have described it in goats and cattle. Transmission of spongiform encephalopathy between individuals is too uncommon for it to be usefully considered an infection. Spongiform encephalopathy is a somatic disorder whose dissemination within a host or transmission between individuals is more like cancer than infectious disease. Spongiform encephalopathy transmission within a species is facilitated in comparison to transmission between species so that cannibalism may amplify the prevalence of the disease. CONCLUSION Agricultural policy should be directed toward an absolute prohibition on occult cannibalism and away from surveillance, quarantine and slaughter, the principal measures of infectious disease containment used to control bovine spongiform encephalopathy.","McAlister, Vivian",Clinical and investigative medicine.

210023,Modelling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: Assessing the usefulness of protective measures to reduce the pandemic at population level,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Several antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi&#8482;-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%).

The purpose of this work is to report the bat specimens from Caatinga localities currently housed in the Mammal Collection of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, a regional collection with important records. A total of 256 specimens were examined, from 40 localities and seven families. Families present in the collection are Phyllostomidae (18 species), Molossidae (6 species), Vespertiolinidae (three species), Noctilionidae (two species), and Emballonuridae, Furipteridae and Mormoopidae, all with one species. The majority of records were from the Caatinga of Pernambuco, including several new municipality records and some species reported for the first time for the state of Pernambuco or neighbouring states. However, the localities sampled represent only 14% ca. of the existing municipalities in the Caatinga of Pernambuco, and in only three of these more than 10 species have been recorded. This shows the scarcity of Caatinga bat records in the main mammal collection of the state, strengthening the importance of further and thorough inventories.","Astúa, Diego; Q.

PED causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, which has led to substantial economic losses in many countries and is a great threat to the global swine industry. Interferons (IFNs) are major cytokines involved in host innate immune defense, which induce the expression of a broad range of antiviral effectors that help host to control and antagonize viral infections. PEDV infection does not elicit a robust IFN response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled. PEDV evades the host innate immune response by two main strategies including: (1) encoding IFN antagonists to disrupt innate immune pathway, and (2) hiding its viral RNA to avoid the exposure of viral RNA to immune sensors. This review highlights the immune evasion mechanisms employed by PEDV, which provides insights for the better understanding of PEDV-host interactions and developing effective vaccines and antivirals against CoVs.","Li, Shasha; Yang, Jinping; Zhu, Zixiang; Zheng, Haixue",,,448

He was admitted and started on a combination of antiviral and antimicrobial therapy. He developed respiratory distress 2 days later, and O2 saturation declined. Blood tests showed an increased N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, and echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction and E/e' ratio of 16. Computed tomography scan showed interstitial pulmonary oedema and prominent peripheral pulmonary vascular markings. Given these findings, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was considered. Low-dose diuretic was started, and fluid administration was restricted, resulting in a decrease in NT-proBNP level, clinical and haemodynamic stabilization, and improved oxygenation.

Total Environ. 750 (2021) 141483]",2020,"The golden era of antibiotics, heralded by the discovery of penicillin, has long been challenged by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Host defense peptides (HDPs), previously known as antimicrobial peptides, are emerging as a group of promising antimicrobial candidates for combatting AMR due to their rapid and unique antimicrobial action. Decades of research have advanced our understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical properties of HDPs and their underlying antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial functions, including immunomodulatory, anti-biofilm, and wound healing properties. However, the mission of translating novel HDP-derived molecules from bench to bedside has yet to be fully accomplished, primarily attributed to their intricate structure-activity relationship, toxicity, instability in host and microbial environment, lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacies, and dwindling interest from large pharmaceutical companies. Based on our previous experience and the expanding knowledge gleaned from the literature, this review aims to summarize the novel strategies that have been employed to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy, proteolytic stability, and cell selectivity, which are all crucial factors for bench-to-bedside translation of HDP-based treatment. Strategies such as residues substitution with natural and/or unnatural amino acids, hybridization, L-to-D heterochiral isomerization, C- and N-terminal modification, cyclization, incorporation with nanoparticles, and ""smart design"" using artificial intelligence technology, will be discussed.

The shortages of PPE, such as N95 respirators, is something that will persist until an effective vaccine is made available. Thus, devices that while being easy to operate can also be rapidly deployed in health centers, and long-term residences without the need for major structural overhaul are instrumental to sustainably use N95 respirators. In this report, we present the design and validation of a decontamination device that combines UV-C & B irradiation with mild-temperature treatment. The device can decontaminate up to 20 masks in a cycle of < 30 min. The decontamination process did not damage or reduce the filtering capacity of the masks. Further, the efficacy of the device to eliminate microbes and viruses from the masks was also evaluated.

The prosocial orientation was measured with individuals' performance in the dictator game (DG), social value orientation (SVO), and the personal norm of reciprocity. Prosocial and proself punishers were established with responses in advantage and disadvantage offers in the UG. Results showed that prosocial and proself punishers coexisted in the UG, and prosocial punishers were more likely to be prosocial in SVO and allocated more resources to the recipient in the DG than proself punishers, but differences in positive/negative reciprocity between prosocial and proself punishers were not found. Further regression analysis found that SVO type and generosity in the DG could predict the type of punishers in the UG, but not positive/negative reciprocity. These findings indicate that individuals rejecting unfair offers in the UG may be motivated by either prosocial motivation with strict fairness concern (prosocial punishment) or selfish motivation with maximizing self-interest concern (proself punishment). Moreover, SVO type and generosity in the DG might be effective measures to discriminate prosocial and proself punishers in the UG.","Li, Jing; Cheng, Nanhua; Hou, Wenwen",PsyCh journal (Online),,448

This study offers a reflection on the current pandemic time through a close reading of selected American classic literary works. The imagination of fear, isolation, and maskwearing in Edgar Allan Poe’s short stories is resonant with the new expressions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three short stories by Poe, i.e., ‘The Masque of the Red Death’, ‘The Cask of Amontillado’, and ‘The Sphinx’ are chosen for examination using the thematic analysis method. Repeated reading of the short stories shows that parallels can be drawn between these stories and today’s phenomenon about anxiety, social restriction, and health protocols. What can be implied from the analysis are as follows: (1) Fear of the disease results in the characters’ added distress, (2) The characters’ aberrant behaviour as to overprotect themselves is exacerbated by the dreadful situation, and (3) Poe’s obsession with dread and death to shock the readers can be historically traced through his own inner predicaments, ill-health, and the 1832 Cholera contagion.

Currently, there are no effective therapies available for corona virus infections. Since the three viruses belong to the same family and share many common features, we can theoretically design a drug that can be effective on all the three of them. In this study, using computational approach, we designed a peptide (Peptide 7) that can bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV thereby preventing the entry of the viruses into the host cell. The peptide inhibitor was designed as a consensus peptide from three different peptides that might individually bind to the RBD of the three viruses. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations using Peptide 7 has shown that it binds with higher affinity than the native receptors of the RBD and forms a stable complex thereby preventing further viral-receptor interaction and inhibiting their cellular entry. This effective binding is observed for the three RBDs, despite the Peptide 7 interactions being slightly different. Hence; this peptide inhibitor can be used as a potential candidate for the development of peptide based anti-viral therapy against Corona viruses.","V K, Priya; Rath, Satish Prasad; Abraham, Parvin",PLoS One,,448

The three deltas considered here were perceived by colonial administrations as ""food bowls"" that would generate wealth in British India (the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta) and Burma (the Ayeyarwady Delta), and for French colonial interests in Indo-China (the Mekong Delta). Delta regions in South and Southeast Asia have historically been key sites of trade, exchange and wealth-creation. What remains difficult to answer is the question of how future delta economies and residents' livelihoods will change, particularly for the resource-poor, should the social-ecological delta systems cross tipping points and reach a point of collapse (Renaud I et al i ., 2014).

Elective medical treatment was substantially reduced but urgent diagnostics and treatment including cancer care should not have been affected. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the number of oncology admissions to 75 German Helios hospitals during 2 time periods in 2020 and compared the data with the respective periods in 2019. The study included nearly 69,000 admissions in total. RESULTS: A highly significant reduction in overall cancer admissions was seen for the early lockdown period from 13 March to 28 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. After an official communication advising the health system to return to normal practice on 29 April 2020, we again found a highly significant difference in admissions compared to the respective time in the previous year. Subgroup analysis shows a significant impact of age >75 years, high hospital volume, and intermediate or high COVID-19 case volume in the federal states. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. The effects and significance levels were comparable in nearly all different diagnostic subgroups according to the ICD codes.

508243,Surface swabbing could predict COVID-19 cases,2021,"Widespread and rapid dissemination of false news has made fact-checking an indispensable requirement. Given its time-consuming and labor-intensive nature, the task calls for an automated support to meet the demand. In this paper, we propose to leverage commonsense knowledge for the tasks of false news classification and check-worthy claim detection. Arguing that commonsense knowledge is a factor in human believability, we fine-tune the BERT language model with a commonsense question answering task and the aforementioned tasks in a multi-task learning environment. For predicting fine-grained false news types, we compare the proposed fine-tuned model's performance with the false news classification models on a public dataset as well as a newly collected dataset. We compare the model's performance with the single-task BERT model and a state-of-the-art check-worthy claim detection tool to evaluate the check-worthy claim detection. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that commonsense knowledge can improve performance in both tasks.","Schlicht, Ipek Baris; Sezerer, Erhan; Tekir, Selma; Han, Oul; Boukhers, Zeyd",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03731v1.pdf,448

Findings of the OBECHO project have formed the unprecedentedly inclusive evidence for policy-making and the establishment of the future research agenda regarding the obesogenic environment. Furthermore, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made this evidence become an important benchmark record of how youths have interacted with the obesogenic environment in the pre-COVID-19 era. The implementation of lockdown measures worldwide for curbing COVID-19 transmission has been affecting not mere youth's lifestyle behaviours and weight status but, more fundamentally, obesogenic environments and hence youth-environment interaction patterns. However, COVID-19, although causing unfavoured changes, will speed up the transformation of the research landscape from traditional to modern modes for more reliable evidence. We should closely track and study those abnormalities caused by COVID-19 and the accompanying interventions.","Jia, Peng",Obes. rev,,448

These programs have permitted a safer return to campus for students by identifying infected persons and temporarily isolating them from the campus population (2,3). The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) implemented COVID-19 prevention measures in Fall 2020* including the following testing programs: clinic-based diagnostic testing, voluntary community screening, and targeted screening (testing of specific student populations in situations of increased transmission risk). During September 30-November 30, 2020, UT Austin students participated in tests for SARS-CoV-2, which resulted in the detection of 401 unique student cases of COVID-19 from among 32,401 tests conducted.† Among students who participated in one targeted screening program for students attending campus events, 18 (37.5%) of 48 infected students were asymptomatic at the time of their positive test result compared with 45 (23%) of 195 students identified through community testing and nine (5.8%) of 158 students identified through clinic-based testing. Targeted screening also identified a different population of students than did clinic-based and community testing programs. Infected students tested through targeted screening were more likely to be non-Hispanic White persons (chi square = 20.42; p<0.03), less likely to engage in public health measures, and more likely to have had interactions in settings where the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is higher, such as restaurants, gyms, and residence halls. In addition to clinic-based SARS-CoV-2 testing at colleges and universities, complementary testing programs such as community and targeted screening might enhance efforts to identify and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among asymptomatic persons and disproportionately affected populations that might not otherwise be reached.","Nerhood, Kayleigh J.; James, Emily R.; Hardin, Allen; Bray, James E.; Hines, Terrance S.; Young, Amy E.; Bhavnani, Darlene",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7035a4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473686/,448

(2020) Pandemic danger to the deep: The risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Although reports suggest that most individuals with COVID-19 develop detectable antibodies post infection, the kinetics, durability, and relative differences between IgM and IgG responses beyond the first few weeks after symptom onset remain poorly understood. METHODS: Within a large, well-phenotyped, diverse, prospective cohort of subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infection and historical controls derived from cohorts with high prevalence of viral coinfections and samples taken during prior flu seasons, we measured SARS-CoV-2 serological responses (both IgG and IgM) using commercially available assays. We calculated sensitivity and specificity, relationship with disease severity and mapped the kinetics of antibody responses over time using generalised additive models. RESULTS: We analysed 1,001 samples from 752 subjects, 327 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (29.7% with severe disease) spanning a period of 90 days from symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower (44.1-47.1%) early (<10 days) after symptom onset but increased to >80% after 10 days. IgM positivity increased earlier than IgG-targeted assays but positivity peaked between day 32 and 38 post onset of symptoms and declined thereafter, a dynamic that was confirmed when antibody levels were analysed, with more rapid decline observed with IgM. Early (<10 days) IgM but not IgG levels were significantly higher in those who subsequently developed severe disease (signal / cut-off 4.20 (0.75-17.93) versus 1.07 (0.21-5.46), P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that post-infectious antibody responses in those with confirmed COVID-19 begin to decline relatively early post infection and suggests a potential role for higher IgM levels early in infection predicting subsequent disease severity","Mallon, P W G; Tinago, W; Garcia Leon, A; McCann, K; Kenny, G; McGettrick, P; Green, S; Inzitari, R; Cotter, A G; Feeney, E R; Savinelli, S; Doran, P",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377721/,448
608849,A Computational Approach to Identify Potential Novel Inhibitors against the Coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND: passive immunotherapy is a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19. Equine polyclonal antibodies (EpAbs) could represent a source of scalable neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess efficacy and safety of EpAbs (INM005) in hospitalized adult patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia in 19 hospitals of Argentina. Primary endpoint was improvement in at least two categories in WHO ordinal clinical scale at day 28 or hospital discharge (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04494984). FINDINGS: between August 1st and October 26th, 2020, a total of 245 patients were enrolled. Enrolled patients were assigned to receive two blinded doses of INM005 (n = 118) or placebo (n = 123). Median age was 54 years old, 65•1% were male and 61% had moderate disease at baseline. Median time from symptoms onset to study treatment was 6 days (interquartile range 5 to 8). No statistically significant difference was noted between study groups on primary endpoint (risk difference [95% IC]: 5•28% [-3•95; 14•50]; p = 0•15). Rate of improvement in at least two categories was statistically significantly higher for INM005 at days 14 and 21 of follow-up. Time to improvement in two ordinal categories or hospital discharge was 14•2 (± 0•7) days in the INM005 group and 16•3 (± 0•7) days in the placebo group, hazard ratio 1•31 (95% CI 1•0 to 1•74). Subgroup analyses showed a beneficial effect of INM005 over severe patients and in those with negative baseline antibodies. Overall mortality was 6•9% the INM005 group and 11•4% in the placebo group (risk difference [95% IC]: 0•57 [0•24 to 1•37]). Adverse events of special interest were mild or moderate; no anaphylaxis was reported. INTERPRETATION: Albeit not having reached the primary endpoint, we found clinical improvement of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, particularly those with severe disease.","Lopardo, Gustavo; Belloso, Waldo H.; Nannini, Esteban; Colonna, Mariana; Sanguineti, Santiago; Zylberman, Vanesa; Muñoz, Luciana; Dobarro, Martín; Lebersztein, Gabriel; Farina, Javier; Vidiella, Gabriela; Bertetti, Anselmo; Crudo, Favio; Alzogaray, Maria Fernanda; Barcelona, Laura; Teijeiro, Ricardo; Lambert, Sandra; Scublinsky, Darío; Iacono, Marisa; Stanek, Vanina; Solari, Rubén; Cruz, Pablo; Casas, Marcelo Martín; Abusamra, Lorena; Luciardi, Héctor Lucas; Cremona, Alberto; Caruso, Diego; de Miguel, Bernardo; Lloret, Santiago Perez; Millán, Susana; Kilstein, Yael; Pereiro, Ana; Sued, Omar; Cahn, Pedro; Spatz, Linus; Goldbaum, Fernando",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100843; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537021001231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870149/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021001231,448

To overcome these inherent problems, in the last decades, innovative nanocarriers have been developed to encapsulate active molecules and offer novel promising strategies to efficiently modulate the immune system. This review provides an overview of how it is possible, exploiting the favorable features of nanocarriers, especially with regard to their immunogenicity, to improve the bioavailability of novel drugs that selectively target immune cells in the context of autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases.

To identify molecules regulating peripheral B cell survival and tolerance to self-antigens (Ags), a gene modifier screen was performed with B cells from CD22-deficient C57BL/6 (CD22(−/−[B6])) mice that undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD) and fail to up-regulate c-Myc expression after B cell Ag receptor ligation. Likewise, lysozyme auto-Ag–specific B cells in Ig(Tg) hen egg lysozyme (HEL) transgenic mice inhabit the spleen but undergo AICD after auto-Ag encounter. This gene modifier screen identified EndoU, a single-stranded RNA-binding protein of ancient origin, as a major regulator of B cell survival in both models. EndoU gene disruption prevents AICD and normalizes c-Myc expression. These findings reveal that EndoU is a critical regulator of an unexpected and novel RNA-dependent pathway controlling peripheral B cell survival and Ag responsiveness that may contribute to peripheral B cell tolerance.","Poe, Jonathan C.; Kountikov, Evgueni I.; Lykken, Jacquelyn M.; Natarajan, Abirami; Marchuk, Douglas A.; Tedder, Thomas F.",J Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20130648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24344237/,448

627904,Structural dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot molecules reveal topologically distinct conformers,2021-08-06,"COVID-19 is by convention characterised by a triad of symptoms: cough, fever and loss of taste/smell. The aim of this study was to examine clustering of COVID-19 symptoms based on underlying chronic disease and geographical location. Using a large global symptom survey of 78,299 responders in 190 different countries, we examined symptom profiles in relation to geolocation (grouped by country) and underlying chronic disease (single, co- or multi-morbidities) associated with a positive COVID-19 test result using statistical and machine learning methods to group populations by underlying disease, countries, and symptoms. Taking the responses of 7980 responders with a COVID-19 positive test in the top 5 contributing countries, we find that the most frequently reported symptoms differ across the globe: For example, fatigue 4108(51.5%), headache 3640(45.6%) and loss of smell and taste 3563(44.6%) are the most reported symptoms globally. However, symptom patterns differ by continent; India reported a significantly lower proportion of headache (22.8% vs 45.6%, p<0.05) and itchy eyes (7.0% vs. 15.3%, p<0.05) than other countries, as does Pakistan (33.6% vs 45.6%, p<0.05 and 8.6% vs 15.3%, p<0.05). Mexico and Brazil report significantly less of these symptoms. As with geographic location, we find people differed in their reported symptoms, if they suffered from specific underlying diseases. For example, COVID-19 positive responders with asthma or other lung disease were more likely to report shortness of breath as a symptom, compared with COVID-19 positive responders who had no underlying disease (25.3% vs. 13.7%, p<0.05, and 24.2 vs.13.7%, p<0.05). Responders with no underlying chronic diseases were more likely to report loss of smell and tastes as a symptom (46%), compared with the responders with type 1 diabetes (21.3%), Type 2 diabetes (33.5%) lung disease (29.3%), or hypertension (37.8%). Global symptom ranking differs markedly from the well-known and commonly described symptoms for COVID-19, which are based on a few localised studies. None of the five countries studied in depth recorded cough or temperature as the most common symptoms. The most common symptoms reported were fatigue and loss of smell and taste. Amongst responders from Brazil cough was the second most frequently reported symptom, after fatigue. Moreover, we find that across countries and based on underlying chronic diseases, there are significant differences in symptom profiles at presentation, that cannot be fully explained by the different chronic disease profiles of these countries, and may be caused by differences in climate, environment and ethnicities. These factors uncovered by our global comorbidity survey of COVID-19 positive tested people may contribute to the apparent large asymptotic COVID-19 spread and put patients with underlying disease systematically more at risk.","Kadirvelu, B.; Burcea, G.; Quint, J.; Costelloe, C.

Here we comprehensively characterize serological, cellular and functional immune parameters of wild mice and compare them with laboratory mice, finding that wild mouse cellular immune systems are, comparatively, in a highly activated (primed) state. Associations between immune parameters and infection suggest that high level pathogen exposure drives this activation. Moreover, wild mice have a population of highly activated myeloid cells not present in laboratory mice. By contrast, in vitro cytokine responses to pathogen-associated ligands are generally lower in cells from wild mice, probably reflecting the importance of maintaining immune homeostasis in the face of intense antigenic challenge in the wild. These data provide a comprehensive basis for validating (or not) laboratory mice as a useful and relevant immunological model system.","Abolins, Stephen; King, Elizabeth C.; Lazarou, Luke; Weldon, Laura; Hughes, Louise; Drescher, Paul; Raynes, John G.; Hafalla, Julius C.

To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization. Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system. Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms. In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation. Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight. Conclusions: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we have identified over 500 symptomatic employees that otherwise would have possibly come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","Zhang, H.; Dimitrov, D.; Simpson, L.; Singh, B.; Plaks, N.; Penney, S.; Charles, J.; Sheehan, R.; Flammini, S.; Murphy, S.; Landman, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069211; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069211v1?rss=1,448

Appropriate glycemic management contributes to a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in acute illness but also requires intensive patient interactions for bedside glucose monitoring, intravenous and subcutaneous insulin administration, as well as rapid intervention for hypoglycemia events. These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On site and remote glucose management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.","Korytkowski, Mary; Antinori-Lent, Kellie; Drincic, Andjela; Hirsch, Irl B; McDonnell, Marie E; Rushakoff, Robert; Muniyappa, Ranganath",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498085/,448

We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000-2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2,114 excess suicides in 2020-2021.

A case study from Quito, Ecuador",2021-01-17,"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The aim of this study was to construct Sars-CoV membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike 2 (S2) gene eukaryotic expression plasmids, and identify their expression in vitro. Gene fragments encoding N protein, M protein and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were amplified by PCR using cDNA obtained from lung samples of SARS patients as template, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector to form eukaryotic expression plasmids. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were transfected respectively into CHO cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV in transfected cells. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were successfully constructed by identification with digestion of restriction enzymes and sequencing. M, N and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV were detected in the cytoplasm of transfected CHO cells. It was concluded that these recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed successfully, and SARS-CoV encoding proteins could activate transcription and expression of hfgl2 gene.","Wang, Hongwu; Han, Meifang; Yao, Huaning; Wang, Zhanhui; Xi, Dong; Yan, Weiming; Hou, Jinlin; Luo, Xiaoping; Ning, Qin",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19513614/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-009-0311-1,448
670566,Costs of inequity.,2021-06-01,"Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical. This article reviews the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the basic principles of molecular techniques commonly used for their detection and characterization. The principles of good laboratory practices for handling pathogenic viruses are also discussed. This review aims at providing researchers and laboratory personnel with an overview of the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the principles of molecular techniques and good laboratory practices commonly implemented for their detection and characterization.","Artika, I Made; Wiyatno, Ageng; Ma'roef, Chairin Nisa",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820300472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006706/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820300472,448

677350,Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into novel wild hosts in North America: A conceptual model for perpetuation of the pathogen,2020-05-12,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been shown to infect both humans and dromedary camels using dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as its receptor. The distribution of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and camels reflects MERS-CoV tropism. Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus). In the frugivorous bats, DPP4 was present in epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the intestinal tract, similar to what has been reported for camels and humans. In the insectivorous bats, however, DPP4 expression in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was almost absent. The preferential expression of DPP4 in the intestinal tract of insectivorous bats, suggests that transmission of MERS-like-CoVs mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route. Our results highlight differences in the distribution of DPP4 expression among MERS-CoV susceptible species, which might influence variability in virus tropism, pathogenesis and transmission route.","Widagdo, W.; Begeman, Lineke; Schipper, Debby; Run, Peter R. van; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Kley, Nils; Reusken, Chantal B.; Haagmans, Bart L.; van den Brand, Judith M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online experiment with 371 participants who viewed a COVID-19 screening session between a hotline agent (chatbot or human) and a user with mild or severe symptoms. RESULTS: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agent’s ability. When ability is the same, users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the user’s trust in the hotline provider, with a slight negative bias against chatbots’ ability. Asians perceived higher ability and benevolence than Whites. CONCLUSION: Ensuring that COVID-19 screening chatbots provide high quality service is critical, but not sufficient for widespread adoption. The key is to emphasize the chatbot’s ability and assure users that it delivers the same quality as human agents.","Dennis, Alan R; Kim, Antino; Rahimi, Mohammad; Ayabakan, Sezgin",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984890/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa167,448
