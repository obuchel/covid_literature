9486,Editorial-Introduction special issue transport & health in Latin America,2020-04-08,"Efforts to develop effective and safe drugs for treatment of tuberculosis require preclinical evaluation in animal models. Alongside efficacy testing of novel therapies, effects on pulmonary pathology and disease progression are monitored by using histopathology images from these infected animals. To compare the severity of disease across treatment cohorts, pathologists have historically assigned a semi-quantitative histopathology score that may be subjective in terms of their training, experience, and personal bias. Manual histopathology therefore has limitations regarding reproducibility between studies and pathologists, potentially masking successful treatments. This report describes a pathologist-assistive software tool that reduces these user limitations, while providing a rapid, quantitative scoring system for digital histopathology image analysis. The software, called ‘Lesion Image Recognition and Analysis’ (LIRA), employs convolutional neural networks to classify seven different pathology features, including three different lesion types from pulmonary tissues of the C3HeB/FeJ tuberculosis mouse model. LIRA was developed to improve the efficiency of histopathology analysis for mouse tuberculosis infection models, this approach has also broader applications to other disease models and tissues.

This caused left bronchial compression by the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, for which an external stenting was successfully performed. The patient had features suggestive of skeletal dysplasia with tracheobronchial malacia. One possible mechanism of vascular compression could be an association of fragility of the thoracic cavity and inspiratory dyspnea, causing thoracic deformity.","Ando, Makoto; Ichimori, Yuki; Sakamoto, Shigeru",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223673/,569

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the expression of the major capsid protein (VP1) of the Genogroup II, genotype 17 (GII.17) NoV, using recombinant baculovirus system in insect cells, as well as a saliva binding blockade assay to detect their protective potency. RESULTS: Our results showed that GII.17 VLPs could be successfully generated in sf9 insect cells, and electron microscopic revealed that GII.17 VLPs appeared as spherical particles with a − 35 nm diameter. Immunized mice with purified VLPs produced GII.17 specific sera and could efficiently block GII.17 VLPs binding to the saliva histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggested that GII.17 VLPs represent a promising vaccine candidate against NoV GII.17 infection and strongly support further preclinical and clinical studies.","Chen, Wei; Kang, Tao; Yuan, Rongliang; Shao, Congwen; Jing, Shenrong",Biotechnol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223773/,569

11728,Supporting your team during a global pandemic,2020-05-05,"Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial bones. The goal of this study was to determine if delivery of recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) could prevent or diminish the severity of craniosynostosis in a C57BL/6 FGFR2(C342Y/+) model of neonatal onset craniosynostosis or a BALB/c FGFR2(C342Y/+) model of postnatal onset craniosynostosis. Mice were injected with a lentivirus encoding a mineral targeted form of TNAP immediately after birth. Cranial bone fusion as well as cranial bone volume, mineral content and density were assessed by micro CT. Craniofacial shape was measured with calipers. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) activity levels were measured in serum. Neonatal delivery of TNAP diminished craniosynostosis severity from 94% suture obliteration in vehicle treated mice to 67% suture obliteration in treated mice, p<0.02) and the incidence of malocclusion from 82.4% to 34.7% (p<0.03), with no effect on cranial bone in C57BL/6 FGFR2(C342Y/+) mice. In contrast, treatment with TNAP increased cranial bone volume (p< 0.01), density (p< 0.01) and mineral content (p< 0.01) as compared to vehicle treated controls, but had no effect on craniosynostosis or malocclusion in BALB/c FGFR2(C342Y/+) mice. These results indicate that postnatal recombinant TNAP enzyme therapy diminishes craniosynostosis severity in the C57BL/6 FGFR2(C342Y/+) neonatal onset mouse model of Crouzon syndrome, and that effects of exogenous TNAP are genetic background dependent.","Nam, Hwa Kyung; Vesela, Iva; Schutte, Sara Dean; Hatch, Nan E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7259715/,569
14345,The Development and Evaluation of a Structured Continuing Professional Development Programme for Pharmacists in Kuwait: A Feasibility Study,2020-11-05,"CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) mimicking the function of microbial CpG-dideoxynucleotides containing DNA (CpG-DNA) are potent immune stimuli. The immunostimulatory activity and the species-specific activities of a CpG-ODN depend on its nucleotide sequence properties, including CpG-hexamer motif types, spacing between motifs, nucleotide sequence, and length. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODNs in mammalian species, while TLR21 is the receptor in avian species. Mammalian cells lack TLR21, and avian cells lack TLR9; however, both TLRs are expressed in fish cells. While nucleotide sequence properties required for a CpG-ODN to strongly activate mammalian TLR9 and its species-specific activities to different mammalian TLR9s are better studied, CpG-ODN activation of TLR21 is not yet well investigated. Here we characterized chicken and duck TLR21s and investigated their activation by CpG-ODNs. Chicken and duck TLR21s contain 972 and 976 amino acid residues, respectively, and differ from TLR9s as they do not have an undefined region in their ectodomain. Cell-based TLR21 activation assays were established to investigate TLR21 activation by different CpG-ODNs. Unlike grouper TLR21, which was preferentially activated by CpG-ODN with a GTCGTT hexamer motif, chicken and duck TLR21s do not distinguish among different CpG-hexamer motifs. Additionally, these two poultry TLR21s were activated by CpG-ODNs with lengths ranging from 15 to 31 nucleotides and with different spacing between CpG-hexamer motifs. These suggested that compared to mammalian TLR9 and grouper TLR21, chicken and duck TLR21s have a broad CpG-ODN sequence recognition profile. Thus, they could also recognize a wide array of DNA-associated molecular patterns from microbes. Moreover, CpG-ODNs are being investigated as antimicrobial agents and as vaccine adjuvants for different species. This study revealed that there are more optimized CpG-ODNs that can be used in poultry farming as anti-infection agents compared to CpG-ODN choices available for other species.","Chuang, Yu-Chen; Tseng, Jen-Chih; Yang, Jing-Xing; Liu, Yi-Ling; Yeh, Da-Wei; Lai, Chao-Yang; Yu, Guann-Yi; Hsu, Li-Chung; Huang, Chun-Ming; Chuang, Tsung-Hsien",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7712946/,569
14483,Creating a Virtual Postoperative Check‐in Service,2020-11-30,"Proprioception, the sense of self-movement and position, is mediated by mechanosensory neurons that detect diverse features of body kinematics. Although proprioceptive feedback is crucial for accurate motor control, little is known about how downstream circuits transform limb sensory information to guide motor output. Here we investigate neural circuits in Drosophila that process proprioceptive information from the fly leg. We identify three cell types from distinct developmental lineages that are positioned to receive input from proprioceptor subtypes encoding tibia position, movement, and vibration. 13Bα neurons encode femur-tibia joint angle and mediate postural changes in tibia position. 9Aα neurons also drive changes in leg posture, but encode a combination of directional movement, high frequency vibration, and joint angle. Activating 10Bα neurons, which encode tibia vibration at specific joint angles, elicits pausing in walking flies. Altogether, our results reveal that central circuits integrate information across proprioceptor subtypes to construct complex sensorimotor representations that mediate diverse behaviors, including reflexive control of limb posture and detection of leg vibration.","Agrawal, Sweta; Dickinson, Evyn S; Sustar, Anne; Gurung, Pralaksha; Shepherd, David; Truman, James W; Tuthill, John C",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7752136/,569
14973,"Two-stage topic modelling of scientific publications: A case study of University of Nairobi, Kenya",2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: As the use of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) becomes more widespread, improvements in resource utilization and cost-effectiveness are necessary. Currently, there are limited data on same-day discharge (SDD) after LAAC. We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDD versus non-SDD in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who underwent LAAC. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 211 patients who underwent the WATCHMAN procedure in a tertiary hospital (June 2016 to June 2019). The primary safety outcome was the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications requiring endovascular intervention, or death through 7 days (periprocedural) and 45 days post-procedure. The secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome and all-cause readmission. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients who had SDD and non-SDD post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients with procedure-related complications on the day of LAAC and patients who were admitted for acute clinical events before LAAC were excluded. One hundred ninety patients were included in the final analysis. Seventy-two of 190 (38%) patients had SDD, and 118 of 190 (62%) had non-SDD. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary safety outcome through 7 days (1.4% versus 5.9%; P=0.26) and 45 days post-procedure (2.8% versus 9.3%; P=0.14) between the two groups. The secondary outcomes were similar in both groups. No patients had device-related thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography at 45 days. Only 1 patient from the non-SDD group had clinically significant peri-device flow (>5 mm) at 45 days. CONCLUSIONS: In a selected cohort of patients who underwent successful elective LAAC with WATCHMAN without same-day procedure-related complications, the primary safety outcome and secondary outcomes through 7 and 45 days post-procedure were similar in the SDD and non-SDD groups. Our findings are hypothesis generating and warrant further investigation in prospective trials.","Tan, Bryan E-Xin; Boppana, Leela Krishna Teja; Abdullah, Abdullah S.; Chuprun, Dmitry; Shah, Abrar; Rao, Mohan; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Depta, Jeremiah P.",Circ Cardiovasc Interv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813443/,569
15460,Endemic chikungunya fever in Kenyan children: a prospective cohort study,2021-02-18,"Critically ill patients are often initially treated by out-of-hospital emergency medicine services. A major challenge—especially at the interface between out-of-hospital and in-hospital care—is to continue patient care without wasting time, while maintaining a high level. These include the stabilization of vital functions (e.g., airway management, noninvasive/invasive ventilation, circulatory stabilization) and implementation of a suitable diagnostic and therapeutic strategy (e.g., laboratory examinations, sonography, radiological imaging). In recent years, therefore, interest and research has focused on the topic of “nontraumatic resuscitation room care”. The first monocentric data recently became available and work is ongoing to develop nontraumatic resuscitation room management for optimal care of critically ill patients in the emergency department. Based on initial studies, experiences and expert opinions, this paper describes a structured approach to nontraumatic resuscitation room management.","Michael, M.; Kumle, B.; Pin, M.; Kümpers, P.; Gröning, I.; Bernhard, M.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891119/,569
15976,Ethics Consultation in Surgical Specialties,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND: Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) is approved in 70 countries, including the United States, for the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible Gram-negative pathogens. C/T is of particular importance as an agent for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The current study summarizes 2018–2019 data from the United States on lower respiratory tract isolates of Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART global surveillance program. The CLSI reference broth microdilution method was used to determine in vitro susceptibility of C/T and comparators against isolates of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales. RESULTS: C/T inhibited 96.0% of P. aeruginosa (n = 1237) at its susceptible MIC breakpoint (≤4 μg/ml), including > 85% of meropenem-nonsusceptible and piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T)-nonsusceptible isolates and 76.2% of MDR isolates. Comparator agents demonstrated lower activity than C/T against P. aeruginosa: meropenem (74.8% susceptible), cefepime (79.2%), ceftazidime (78.5%), P/T (74.4%), and levofloxacin (63.1%). C/T was equally active against ICU (96.0% susceptible) and non-ICU (96.7%) isolates of P. aeruginosa. C/T inhibited 91.8% of Enterobacterales (n = 1938) at its susceptible MIC breakpoint (≤2 μg/ml); 89.5% of isolates were susceptible to cefepime and 88.0% susceptible to P/T. 67.1 and 86.5% of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) screen-positive isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 85) and Escherichia coli (n = 74) and 49.6% of MDR Enterobacterales were susceptible to C/T. C/T was equally active against ICU (91.3% susceptible) and non-ICU (92.6%) Enterobacterales isolates. CONCLUSION: Data from the current study support the use of C/T as an important treatment option for lower respiratory tract infections including those caused by MDR P. aeruginosa.

16384,A Medical Pearl Harbor: Pandemic Uncovers Societal Fissures and Leadership Breaches,2021-01-16,"In this work, we performed an analysis of the networks of interactions between drugs and their targets to assess how connected the compounds are. For our purpose, the interactions were downloaded from the DrugBank database, and we considered all drugs approved by the FDA. Based on topological analysis of this interaction network, we obtained information on degree, clustering coefficient, connected components, and centrality of these interactions. We identified that this drug-target interaction network cannot be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, i.e., it is not bipartite. In addition, the connectivity or associations between every pair of nodes identified that the drug-target network is constituted of 165 connected components, where one giant component contains 4376 interactions that represent 89.99% of all the elements. In this regard, the histamine H1 receptor, which belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors and is activated by the biogenic amine histamine, was found to be the most important node in the centrality of input-degrees. In the case of centrality of output-degrees, fostamatinib was found to be the most important node, as this drug interacts with 300 different targets, including arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase or ALOX5, expressed on cells primarily involved in regulation of immune responses. The top 10 hubs interacted with 33% of the target genes. Fostamatinib stands out because it is used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults. Finally, 187 highly connected sets of nodes, structured in communities, were also identified. Indeed, the largest communities have more than 400 elements and are related to metabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and cancer. Our results demonstrate the possibilities to explore these compounds and their targets to improve drug repositioning and contend against emergent diseases.","Galan-Vasquez, Edgardo; Perez-Rueda, Ernesto",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968663/,569
16605,"The Effect of Perceived Value, Trust, and Commitment on Patient Loyalty in Taiwan",2021-04-02,"Progress in our understanding of MR1-restricted mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells has raised interest in harnessing these cells for immunotherapy. The innate-like response characteristics, abundance in the blood, donor-unrestricted nature, and tropism for tissues make MAIT cells suitable candidates for adoptive cell transfer therapies. However, reliable methods and tools to utilize MAIT cells in such approaches are lacking. Here, we established methodology for efficient expansion of human MAIT cells in culture with high purity and yield, while preserving their functional response toward their natural ligand and increasing their cytotoxic potential. The cultured MAIT cells retained their effector memory characteristics without signs of terminal differentiation and expressed a more diverse set of chemokine receptors, potentially widening their already broad tissue tropism. To investigate the potential of MAIT cells in a context outside their main role in controlling bacterial infection, we engineered cultured MAIT cells with a new TCR specificity to mediate effective antiviral HLA class I–restricted effector function. In summary, we developed robust and effective methodology for the expansion of human MAIT cells with enhanced cytolytic capacity and for their engineering with a new specificity. These findings form a basis for the development of MAIT cells as a platform for adoptive immunotherapy.","Parrot, Tiphaine; Healy, Katie; Boulouis, Caroline; Sobkowiak, Michał J.; Leeansyah, Edwin; Aleman, Soo; Bertoletti, Antonio; Sällberg Chen, Margaret; Sandberg, Johan K.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021122/,569

Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.","Swanson, Elliott; Lord, Cara; Reading, Julian; Heubeck, Alexander T; Genge, Palak C; Thomson, Zachary; Weiss, Morgan DA; Li, Xiao-jun; Savage, Adam K; Green, Richard R; Torgerson, Troy R; Bumol, Thomas F; Graybuck, Lucas T; Skene, Peter J",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034981/,569

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) effectively mitigates this burden; however, utilization is low. CR barriers in China have not been well characterized; this study sought to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and psychometrically validate the CR Barriers Scale in Chinese/Mandarin (CRBS-C/M). METHODS: Independent translations of the 21-item CRBS were conducted by two bilingual health professionals, followed by back-translation. A Delphi process was undertaken with five experts to consider the semantics and cross-cultural relevance of the items. Following finalization, 380 cardiac patients from 11 hospitals in Shanghai were administered a validation survey including the translated CRBS. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency was assessed. Validity was tested through assessing the association of the CRBS-C/M with the CR Information Awareness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Items were refined and finalized. Factor analysis of CRBS-C/M (Kaiser Meyer Olkin = 0.867, Bartlett's test p < 0.001) revealed five factors: perceived CR need, external logistical factors, time conflicts, program and health system-level factors, and comorbidities/lack of vitality; Cronbach's alpha (α) of the subscales ranged from 0.67 to 0.82. The mean total CRBS score was significantly lower in patients who participated in CR compared with those who did not, demonstrating criterion validity (2.35 ± 0.71 vs. 3.08 ± 0.55; p < 0.001). Construct validity was supported by the significant associations between total CRBS scores and CR awareness, sex, living situation, city size, income, diagnosis/procedure, disease severity, and several risk factors (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CRBS-C/M is reliable and valid, so barriers can be identified and mitigated in Mandarin-speaking patients.","Liu, Xia; Fowokan, Adeleke; Grace, Sherry L.; Ding, Biao; Meng, Shu; Chen, Xiu; Xia, Yinghua; Zhang, Yaqing",Rehabil Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8233091/,569

With over 200 hereditary disease pathologies reported in the cat, the clinical and physiological study of these feline hereditary diseases provides a strong comparative medicine opportunity for prevention, diagnostics, and treatment studies in a laboratory setting. Causal mutations have been characterized in 19 felid genes, with the largest representation from lysosomal storage enzyme disorders. Corrective therapeutic strategies for several disorders have been proposed and examined in the cat, including enzyme replacement, heterologous bone marrow transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Genomics tools developed in the cat, including the recent completion of the 2-fold whole genome sequence of the cat and genome browser, radiation hybrid map of 1793 integrated coding and microsatellite loci, a 5-cM genetic linkage map, arrayed BAC libraries, and flow sorted chromosomes, are providing resources that are being utilized in mapping and characterization of genes of interest. A recent report of the mapping and characterization of a novel causative gene for feline spinal muscular atrophy marked the first identification of a disease gene purely from positional reasoning. With the development of genomic resources in the cat and the application of complementary comparative tools developed in other species, the domestic cat is emerging as a promising resource of phenotypically defined genetic variation of biomedical significance.

26897,An empirical study on the impact of quality antecedents on tax payers' acceptance of Internet tax-filing systems,2005-07-14,"In his paper from 2003, Peter Keller postulates that a strategic pricing policy can pose an opportunity for Swiss tourism, strengthening the competitiveness and growth of the industry. This contribution from Peter Keller’s celebratory publication on the occasion of his 20th presidency of the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism (AIEST) picks up on this assumption and discusses the touristic development and enhancement of strategic pricing over the past ten years of Swiss tourism. In the first section of this paper, empirical evidence of the development of Swiss tourism over time and a discussion of its challenges are presented. The second section addresses the postulated value-based pricing concept, including practical examples from Swiss tourism over the past ten years. The third section offers a conclusion, which discusses the relevance of strategic pricing as a means to strengthen competitiveness with respect to future terms. Peter Keller has been involved in scientific tourism research as the president of the AIEST for 20 years. Believing strongly in the fact that sustainable tourism research should be dedicated to a holistic, systemic as well as pragmatic approach, he constantly warned of disciplinary and autarchic traits of tourism research (Keller 2007, S. 96ff.). As an advocate of tourism science, which should be concerned with a human, social and cultural scientific reflection without excluding the viewpoint of economics or business administration, he also crucially influenced national tourism politics as a head of the Tourism Department at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). In his article ""Strategic pricing policy as a chance for Swiss tourism"" (Keller, 2003, S. 193ff.), he emphasises a ""back-to-growth strategy"" for Swiss tourism by focusing on a strategic marketing approach, which is oriented towards the ""value-based pricing principle"" and focuses more on price as a constitutive element. The following paper discusses the past development of the Swiss tourism industry since Peter Keller’s article was published in 2003 and notes the valuebased pricing approach. For this purpose, we examine the development of Swiss tourism, outline the postulated ""value-based pricing principle"" and discuss some practical applications from daily touristic business. Finally, we draw a conclusion about the applicability of strategic pricing in the future.","Bandi, Monika; Friedli, Therese Lehmann",Tourism and Leisure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123928/,569

To account for the time-variability of conditional correlation, a dynamic correlation structure is included in the volatility model specification. The empirical results demonstrate that the renminbi non-deliverable forward (NDF) has been a driver of various Asian currency markets but that such co-movements exhibit a substantial degree of heterogeneity. As to the determinants of the magnitude of these co-movements, we test the relevance of potential factors and find that it is the degree of real and financial integration, in particular, that exerts the largest influence on volatility transmission.","COLAVECCHIO, Roberta; FUNKE, Michael",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148942/,569

32403,Voorkom burn-out en PTSS,2020-05-22,"Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a fundamental task in location-based social networks. Different from traditional item recommendation, POI recommendation is highly context-dependent: (1) geographical influence, e.g., users prefer to visit POIs that are not far away; (2) time-sensitivity, e.g., restaurants are preferred in dinner time; (3) dependency in a user’s check-in sequence, e.g., POIs planned in a trip. Yet, existing methods either partially leverage such context information or combine different types of contexts using a global weighting scheme, failing to capture the phenomenon that the importance of each context is also context-dependent rather than the same for all recommendation. In this paper, we propose a model to exploit spatial-temporal contexts in a POI-guided attention mechanism for POI recommendation. Such an attention mechanism offers us high flexibility to capture the POI-specific importance of each context. Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla demonstrate that the POI-specific context importance significantly improves the performance of POI recommendation.","Wang, Hao; Shen, Huawei; Cheng, Xueqi",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206255/,569

For applications like ranking and cost-sensitive classification, probability estimation trees (PETs) are used. These are built using smoothing or calibration techniques. Older smoothing techniques used counts local to a leaf node, but a few more recent techniques consider the broader context of a node when doing estimation. We apply a recent advanced smoothing method called Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to PETs, and then propose a novel hierarchical smoothing approach called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) as an alternative. HGS smooths leaf nodes up to all the ancestors, instead of recursively smoothing to the parent used by HDP. HGS is made faster by efficiently optimizing the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) loss measure using gradient descent, instead of sampling used in HDP. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on 143 datasets showing that our HGS estimates are not only more accurate but also do so within a fraction of HDP time. Besides, HGS makes a single tree almost as good as a Random Forest with 10 trees. For applications that require more interpretability and efficiency, a single decision tree plus HGS is more preferred.","Zhang, He; Petitjean, François; Buntine, Wray",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206292/,569

However, most event recorder (ER) data shows only regular driving events. To utilize near-miss data for safe-driving education, we need to be able to easily and rapidly locate the appropriate data from large amounts of ER data through labels attached to the scenes/events of interest. This paper proposes a method that can automatically identify near-misses with objects such as pedestrians and bicycles by processing the ER data. The proposed method extracts two deep feature representations that consider car status and the environment surrounding the car. The first feature representation is generated by considering the temporal transitions of car status. The second one can extract the positional relationship between the car and surrounding objects by processing object detection results. Experiments on actual ER data demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify and tag near-miss events.","Yamamoto, Shuhei; Kurashima, Takeshi; Toda, Hiroyuki",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206299/,569
33220,Pandemic Parliaments: Canadian Legislatures in a Time of Crisis,2020-05-15,"ABSTRACT: Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal infections. Its main etiological agent is Gardnerella vaginalis, which produces several virulence factors involved in vaginal infection and colonization, in particular, sialidase (SLD), a potential clinical biomarker that participates in immune response modulation and mucus degradation. The main objective of this work was the production and evaluation of a monoclonal antibody against G. vaginalis sialidase and its validation in immunoassays. For immunization of mice, a synthetic multiantigenic peptide was used, and hybridomas were generated. After fusion, hybridomas were evaluated for antibody production and cloned by limited dilution. One clone producing IgG1 was selected and characterized by indirect ELISA, dot blot, and Western blot, and we also tested clinical isolates and HeLa cells infected with G. vaginalis. The results showed that the anti-SLD antibody recognized a single protein of ~90 kDa that correlated with the estimated molecular weight of SLD. In addition, anti-SLD antibody recognized SLD from complete bacteria and from culture supernatants of infected Hela cells. In conclusion, our results showed that the anti-SLD antibody recognized SLD from different sources and could be considered a new tool for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. KEY POINTS: • Anti-sialidase mAb was generated using a synthetic peptide • The mAb recognizes synthetic peptide and intact protein from multiple sources • The antibody was characterized by several immunological methods","Cortés-Sarabia, Karen; Rodríguez-Nava, Cynthia; Medina-Flores, Yolanda; Mata-Ruíz, Olga; López-Meza, Joel E.; Gómez-Cervantes, Miying Dessire; Parra-Rojas, Isela; Illades-Aguiar, Berenice; Flores-Alfaro, Eugenia; Vences-Velázquez, Amalia",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253150/,569

Given a static digraph G, and a subset [Formula: see text], a spanning branching with root R is a subdigraph of G that has exactly one path from R to each [Formula: see text]. In this paper, we consider the temporal version of Edmonds’ classical result about the problem of finding k edge-disjoint spanning branchings respectively rooted at given [Formula: see text]. We introduce and investigate different definitions of spanning branchings, and of edge-disjointness in the context of temporal graphs. A branching [Formula: see text] is vertex-spanning if the root is able to reach each vertex v of G at some time where v is active, while it is temporal-spanning if v can be reached from the root at every time where v is active. On the other hand, two branchings [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are edge-disjoint if they do not use the same edge of G, and are temporal-edge-disjoint if they can use the same edge of G but at different times. This lead us to four definitions of disjoint spanning branchings and we prove that, unlike the static case, only one of these can be computed in polynomial time, namely the temporal-edge-disjoint temporal-spanning branchings problem, while the other versions are [Formula: see text]-complete, even under very strict assumptions.","Campos, Victor; Lopes, Raul; Marino, Andrea; Silva, Ana",Combinatorial Algorithms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254906/,569

Hence, in search of political solutions to ‘wicked’ and similarly complex problems, deploying polysemic ideas would be critical to effective policy-making. This paper scopes the policy-making potential of polysemic ideas by examining the impact of an ambiguous concept known as ‘One Health’ on responses to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Australia and the UK. It offers two primary arguments. Firstly, polysemic ideas can help mobilise broad attention to complex problems: since One Health became associated with AMR, political and administrative attention has grown more intense and coordinated than previously. Secondly, however, a polysemic idea alone may be insufficient to generate effective action: the contrast between Australian and UK AMR policies illustrates that polysemic ideas do not suspend interests, institutions, or ideas that can be readily deployed.

34014,"Keep your mission student‐centered, even in the face of crisis",2020-05-19,"Power quality analysis involves the measurement of quantities that characterize a power supply waveform such as its frequency. The measurement of those quantities are regulated by internationally accepted standards from IEEE or IEC. Monitoring the delivered power quality is even more important due to recent advances in power electronics and also due to the increasing penetration of renewable energies in the electrical power grid. The primary suggested method by IEC to measure the power grid frequency is to count the number of zero crossings in the voltage waveform that occur during 0.2 s. The standard zero crossing method is usually applied to a filtered signal that has a non deterministic and frequency dependent delay. For monitoring the power grid a range between 42.5 and 57.5 Hz should be considered which means that the filter must be designed in order to attenuate the delay compensation error. Fuzzy Boolean Nets can be considered a neural fuzzy model where the fuzziness is an inherent emerging property that can ignore some outliers acting as a filter. This property can be useful to apply zero crossing without false crossing detection and estimate the real timestamp without the non deterministic delay concern. This paper presents a comparison between the standard frequency estimation, a Goertzel interpolation method, and the standard method applied after a FBN network instead of a filtered signal.","Rodrigues, Nuno M.; Carvalho, Joao P.; Janeiro, Fernando M.; Ramos, Pedro M.",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274345/,569

With no clear remedies to treat the disease, doctors are repurposing drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. In parallel, research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans. Since animal models are critical for vaccine development and SARS-CoV-2 has different transmission dynamics, in this review we compare different animal models of SARS-CoV-2 with humans for their pathogenic, immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for COVID-19. Another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research; thus, we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies.","Deb, Bijayeeta; Shah, Hemal; Goel, Suchi",J Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291183/,569

Devising computational models of visitor engagement shows significant promise for enabling adaptive support to enhance visitors’ learning experiences and for providing analytic tools for museum educators. A salient feature of science museums is their capacity to attract diverse visitor populations that range broadly in age, interest, prior knowledge, and socio-cultural background, which can significantly affect how visitors interact with museum exhibits. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for predicting learner engagement with Future Worlds, a tabletop science exhibit for environmental sustainability. We utilize multi-channel data (e.g., eye tracking, facial expression, posture, interaction logs) captured from visitor interactions with a fully-instrumented version of Future Worlds to model visitor dwell time with the exhibit in a science museum. We demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach outperforms competitive baseline techniques.

The causes of PHH are still not entirely understood, and its prevention and treatment are controversial. We tried to analyze the risk factors for such complication in our cohort. METHODS: We reviewed our neonatology data bank and included all preterms below 28 weeks who were born in the period between 1999 and 2014 and suffered from an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). We reviewed gestational age, gender, birth weight, type of birth, IVH degree, comorbidities, therapy, complications, time to event, protein content of cerebrospinal fluid, and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 180 patients, divided into two subgroups, “B1” with 37 cases (IVH + PHH) and “B2” with 143 cases (IVH − PHH). In group B1, the presence of IVH grades I, II, III, or IV was in 11%, 19%, and 70% respectively. Nineteen patients were treated with a ventricular access device (VAD) or external ventricular drain (EVD). A total of 20 shunts were implanted, with 11 revisions (55%). One patient suffered from thrombocytopenia. In subgroup B2, 51% showed IVH grade I, whereas severe IVH grades were only present in 22%. 25.9% suffered from thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was significantly higher in patients who did not develop PHH (p value: 0.002). CONCLUSION: According to our results, thrombocytopenia could play a decisive role in avoiding development of PHH as a sequel of IVH. We recommend a randomized controlled trial to assess the possible efficacy of antiplatelet drugs in avoiding PHH in this vulnerable group.","El Damaty, Ahmed; Giannoni, Luca; Unterberg, Andreas; Baechli, Heidi",Childs Nerv Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358285/,569

OBJECTIVES: To report on the rate of major complications following spinal fusion and instrumentation to treat spinal deformity in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Understanding the risk of major complications following the surgical treatment of spine deformities in patients with CP is critical. METHODS: A prospectively collected, multicenter database of patients with CP who had surgical correction of their spinal deformity (scoliosis or kyphosis) was reviewed for all major complications. Patients with ≥ 2 year follow-up or who died ≤ 2 years of surgery were included. A complication was defined as major if it resulted in reoperation, re-admission to the hospital, prolongation of the hospital stay, was considered life-threatening, or resulted in residual disability. Overall complication and revision rates were calculated for the perioperative (Peri-op; occurring ≤ 90 days postoperative) and delayed postoperative (Delayed; > 90 days) time periods. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-seven patients met inclusion. Seventy-eight (30%) patients had a major complication, 18 (7%) had > 1. There were 92 (36%) major complications; 64 (24.9%) occurred Peri-op. The most common Peri-op complications were wound (n = 16, 6.2%) and pulmonary issues (n = 28, 10.9%), specifically deep infections (n = 12, 4.7%) and prolonged ventilator support (n = 21, 8.2%). Delayed complications (n = 28, 10.9%) were primarily deep infections (n = 8, 3.1%) and instrumentation-related (n = 6, 2.3%). There were 42 additional surgeries for an overall unplanned return to the operating room rate of 16% (Peri-op: 8.6%, Delayed: 7.8%). Thirty-six (14.0%) reoperations were spine related surgeries (wound or instrumentation-related). Eleven (4.3%) patients died between 3 months to 5.6 years postoperatively; 4 occurred ≤ 1 year of surgery. Two deaths were directly related to the spinal deformity surgery. CONCLUSION: Spinal deformity surgery in CP patients with greater than 2 years of follow-up have a postoperative major complication rate of 36% with a spine-related reoperation rate of 14.0%.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in the PICU of children’s hospital in Shanghai from July 2016 to June 2019. Sixty-seven children over 29 days to 14 years old with adenovirus pneumonia who were admitted to PICU with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were included in this study. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital and PICU length of stay (LOS), and risk factors of worse outcome. RESULTS: Of 67 children with severe adenovirus pneumonia, the hospital mortality was 16.42% (11/67) and 28-day mortality was 14.93% (10/67). Median Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) score at admission was 13 (interquartile range [IQR], 10–15). Median PICU LOS stay was 11 days (8-18d) and hospital LOS was 22 days (16-31d).

However, DNA extracted from these tissues is often not optimal for most downstream molecular analysis due to fragmentation and chemical modification. In this study, the complete genome of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was reconstructed from ~ 2-year-old archived Davidson’s-fixed paraffin-embedded (DFPE) shrimp tissue using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). A histological analysis was performed on archived DFPE shrimp tissue and a sample showing a high level of WSSV infection was selected for molecular analysis. The viral infection was further confirmed by molecular methods. DNA isolated from DFPE and fresh frozen (FF) tissues were sequenced by NGS. The complete genome reconstruction of WSSV (~ 305 kbp) was achieved from both DFPE and FF tissue. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion and deletions were compared between the genomes. Thirty-eight mutations were identified in the WSSV genomes from the DFPE and FF that differed from the reference genome. This is the first study that has successfully sequenced the complete genome of a virus of over 300 kbp from archival DFPE tissue. These findings demonstrate that DFPE shrimp tissue represents an invaluable resource for prospective and retrospective studies, evolutionary studies and opens avenues for pathogen discovery.","Cruz-Flores, Roberto; Mai, Hung N.; Kanrar, Siddhartha; Aranguren Caro, Luis Fernando; Dhar, Arun K.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7417530/,569

38512,Report published on returning to clinic,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Young people have become disillusioned with mainstream electoral politics in established democracies, and are increasingly likely to engage in democracy on a case-by-case basis in issues that hold meaning for their everyday lives. These issues are most likely to be local and involve interconnected economic, social and environmental concerns. RESULTS: The following study contributes to the understanding of the everyday politics of young people within a single urban environment (London) regarding sustainability-related issues. It departs from many previous studies of sustainability by employing a youth-centred approach, focussing on the authentic voices of young Londoners. The article shows how narrative structures can provide an effective way of understanding everyday politics and the interconnectedness of key issues through the words of these young people. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identifies young people’s relatively low prioritisation of most environmental issues – due to an overwhelming sense of economic precarity and a lack of opportunity to reflect upon the relevance of environmental issues for their everyday lives. The article emphasizes the importance of opening up spaces for deliberation and channels for youth engagement, to embed sustainability in global cities.","Sloam, James",Sustain Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453695/,569

In this paper, GaN MOSHEMT based biosensor is proposed for detection of biomolecules such as ChOx, protein, streptavidin and Uricase. The effect of biomolecule species on the performance parameters of the device has been studied. It has been observed that there is a significant increase in the drain current and g(d) is observed with the addition of biomolecule in the nanocavity. The electron concentration contour is studied which shows the rise of carrier concentration with biomolecule. Maximum positive shift is observed in threshold voltage for Uricase due to lowest dielectric constant. Similarly, the change in transconductance is also obtained with biomolecules. The effect of cavity dimensions on sensitivity is also studied. The maximum increase of 10% in channel potential is noted due biomolecule presence in the cavity. This device has shown good sensing and can be used for biosensing applications efficiently in addition to the high power performance of MOS-HEMTs.","Shaveta; Ahmed, H. M.

Licorice root-associated bacterial communities shaped by soil characteristics are supposed to regulate the accumulation of root secondary metabolites. METHODS: The soil characteristics, root secondary metabolites, and root-associated bacterial communities were analyzed in licorice plants of different ages to explore their temporal dynamics and interaction mechanisms. RESULTS: Temporal variation in soil characteristics and root secondary metabolites was distinct. The alpha-diversity of root-associated bacterial communities decreased with root proximity, and the community composition was clustered in the rhizosphere. Different taxa that were core-enriched from the dominant taxa in the bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere displayed varied time–decay relationships. Soil total potassium (TK) as a key factor regulated the temporal variation in some individual taxa in the bulk and rhizosphere soils; these taxa were associated with the adjustment of root secondary metabolites across different TK levels. CONCLUSIONS: Licorice specifically selects root-associated core bacteria over the course of plant development, and TK is correlated with root secondary metabolites and individual core-enriched taxa in the bulk and rhizosphere soils, which may have implications for practical licorice cultivation.

The elements of globalization include international movement of goods and people, financial capital, and information along with technological developments, political dynamics, tourism, and ecological consequences. This study used the Globalization Convergence Index (GCI) as a measure of multi-dimension globalization and linked it with health indicators to analyze if high-ranking countries were doing better in terms of mortality rates. Different statistical tests were performed to measure the impact of the globalization process on mortality indicators of public health. Findings suggest that highly globalized countries have better health measured in the form of low mortality rates. On domain level, technology was found to be the major driving force for reducing mortality rates followed by social-cultural and ecological domains. In globalization debate, the top-ranked countries were usually lauded as “achievers”, while low-ranked ones were regarded as “losers”. In our opinion, care should be taken while interpreting the observed positive association as simple evidence that globalization is mostly good for our health.","Raza, Mohsin; Afzal, Muhammad Inam; Elahi, Muhammad Ather",Arab J Geosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518947/,569

The present pandemic made obvious to the general public the central role of vaccines in the support of modern lifestyle. It also revealed the possibility (or near certainty) of totally new pandemics, for which the world had ample warnings, with AIDS, Ebola, Zika, Lassa, Hendra, SARS, MERS, and many other emerging viruses threatening the world order. We entered a new era of pandemics as the last areas of the planet become members of the global village and due to climate change. Therefore, the world will go through a period of new threats that become more intense due several factors. These include the climate change, the dense co-habitation of large number of humans and their food, the rapid, cheap and universal travel, and the public health rules and traditions. Vaccines and immunotherapies are among the best and most cost-effective ways to address new and established epidemic threats. Work on a safe and effective coronavirus vaccines progresses with unprecedented speed and substantial resources. Vaccines may be available in a year, and this time could be shortened if emergency approval of a safe but not fully tested vaccine is allowed. Production ability is expected to address the challenge of high demand, but the worrisome signals are that, even under the conditions of a spreading epidemic, a sector of the population is not convinced about the remedies, whether they are public health measures, or preventive vaccines. Addressing the reasons for the denial of scientific method and conclusions is a major priority for everybody involved in the fight of this and other epidemics.

Subsequent, mass vaccination campaigns coupled with widespread elimination of the YF mosquito vector significantly decreased YF cases and reduced outbreaks to the tropical and subtropical forested regions of Africa and South America. However, recent (2016) large outbreaks in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and South-Eastern Brazil, where previously had been demarcated as low-risk regions, have highlighted the possibility of a rapidly changing epidemiology and the potential re-emergence of yellow fever virus (YFV). Furthermore, the first-ever importation of YFV into Asia has highlighted the potential fear of YFV emerging as a global threat. In this review, we describe the changing epidemiology of YF outbreaks, and highlight the use of public health policies, therapeutics, and vaccination as tools to help eliminate future YFV outbreaks.","Bifani, Amanda Makha; Ong, Eugenia Z.; de Alwis, Ruklanthi",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7644428/,569

42221,"COVID‐19 and the New Technologies of Organizing: Digital Exhaust, Digital Footprints, and Artificial Intelligence in the Wake of Remote Work",2020-10-17,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic that has required mobilization to meet urgent needs. In this mobilization, emergency use authorizations (EUA) have been issued by the FDA to expedite the deployment of these tests. This has led to a situation whereby sensitivity has not been rigorously studied for any of the assays with EUAs. Estimates can be extrapolated from the limited samples documented by the company in their instructions for use (IFU). Although the nationwide shortage of testing reagents prevent parallel testing of multiple platforms on all specimens, observations of repeat specimens at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) provides the first study in the literature of more complete data for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RT-PCR) assay on sensitivity on the Abbott (Abbott Park Ill) and Cepheid (Sunnyvale CA) assays. METHODS: A retrospective search was performed for all test results for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from 3/1/2020 to 4/14/2020 at Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Medical Center, in order to evaluate the sensitivity on Abbott m2000 and Cepheid platforms. Results across multiple reference laboratories and in-house testing platforms were collated in a table with all patients clinically requiring repeat testing recorded. RESULTS: 114/863 patients had repeat testing. The tests were performed initially by outside reference laboratories (25 patients), on the Abbott m2000 (63 patients), and Cepheid Infinity (26 patients). 15/114 (13%) had discordant results on repeat testing. This included 1 test initially done by a reference laboratory. 8 days after the initial result from the reference lab, a positive for the same patient was identified on the Abbott platform. 11 initial Abbott results were discordant on further repeat testing on two platforms - Abbott (6 patients) and Cepheid (5 patients) 1-6 days later. In addition, 3 initial Cepheid were discordant on further repeat testing by the same Cepheid platform (1-16 days later). CONCLUSION: While the instructions for use for both platforms suggest 100% sensitivity and specificity (due to the 100% positive and negative percent agreement in limited specimens), the true sensitivity is less than 100%, particularly early in the course of the infection. In our study, the positive percent agreement (surrogate for sensitivity) was 83% for initial Abbott tests, 88% for initial Cepheid tests, and 95% by Reference laboratory platform.","Dalal, S; Patel, S; Petersen, J M; Jhala, D",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665288/,569

43559,On Kantian tendencies during the early corona pandemic in Germany,2020-12-23,"Public health messages during the COVID-19 pandemic have indicated a higher risk for older people and/or those who have multiple health conditions. Subsequent societal discourse, however, has at times arguably protested the full protection and treatment of older people from COVID-19, potentially contributing to internalized ageism. To date, how older people interpret age-related pandemic messaging and discourse has not been explored. This study examined older adults’ perspectives of age-related COVID-19 messaging and societal discourse, as well as their perceptions of vulnerability, using a social constructionism framework. Adults age 65 to 89 years participated in semi-structured interviews about their thoughts and experiences with ongoing pandemic-related public messaging. Preliminary analysis suggests that participant perspectives of COVID-19 messaging are situated along a continuum of concern associated with contracting the virus. While some, for example, describe minimal concern, others express being fearful. Individual perceptions of safety appear to be informed, in part, by the presence or absence of an underlying health condition. Individual approaches to media criticism and consumption, personal risk-taking thresholds, financial stability, and social connectedness also appear to influence how the participants perceive pandemic-related messaging. Findings suggest the framing of COVID-19 and pandemic protocols, as well as the media’s sensationalization of age-related issues, can impact older peoples’ perceived vulnerability of contracting the virus. Future research is needed to understand the long-term implications of ongoing pandemic-related messaging on older adults’ experiences of aging, as well as the consequences such messaging could pose to for their health and social behaviors.","Sangrar, Ruheena; Chesser, Stephanie; Porter, Michelle",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741996/,569

Indeed, speaking about the present, OR has been already contributing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic from its beginning, integrated with other techniques to forecast and simulate future scenarios. For instance, OR can help decide how to optimally allocate resources and how to manage the supply chain of food, medical and essential items. We illustrate a few examples of the efforts done to tackle several aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We screened the core active components and the action targets of Shiyifang Vinum through the TCMSP database and literature mining and drew a Venn map of the intersection with anti-inflammatory and analgesic-related gene targets. Go and KEGG analyses were enriched with the David database. The compound target pathway network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.6.1. The binding strength of core active compounds and target proteins was verified through molecular docking, and the direct effects of Shiyifang Vinum and four monomer compounds on COX-2 enzyme activity were detected through an in vitro enzyme activity test. RESULTS: 14 active compounds and 11 targets were screened out from Shiyifang Vinum through TCMSP database and literature mining; 252 GO entries were obtained by GO analysis, and 114 signal pathways were screened by KEGG analysis. The results of the molecular docking showed that the core compounds and target proteins had strong binding activity. In vitro validation experiments showed that both the Shiyifang Vinum and the four monomer compounds could inhibit the activity of COX-2. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily explored the potential active compounds and target proteins of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of Shiyifang Vinum, which could provide a scientific basis for further study on the anti-inflammatory and analgesic mechanism and material basis of this recipe.","Tian, Hui; Wei, Linli; Yao, Yunxiu; Zeng, Zhaoqing; Liang, Xue; Zhu, Hua",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817263/,569
45269,Geographically Weighted Method Integrated with Logistic Regression for Analyzing Spatially Varying Accuracy Measures of Remote Sensing Image Classification,2021-02-01,"This paper describes the development of a new topology optimization framework that controls, captures, isolates, switches, or separates particles depending on their material properties and initial locations. Controlling the trajectories of particles in laminar fluid has several potential applications. The fluid drag force, which depends on the fluid and particle velocities and the material properties of particles, acts on the surfaces of the particles, thereby affecting the trajectories of the particles whose deformability can be neglected. By changing the drag or inertia force, particles can be controlled and sorted depending on their properties and initial locations. In several engineering applications, the transient motion of particles can be controlled and optimized by changing the velocity of the fluid. This paper presents topology optimization schemes to determine optimal pseudo rigid domains in fluid to control the motion of particles depending on their properties, locations, and geometric constraints. The transient sensitivity analysis of the positions of particles can be derived with respect to the spatial distributed design variables in topology optimization. The current optimization formulations are evaluated for effectiveness based on different conditions. The experimental results indicate that the formulations can determine optimal fluid layouts to control the trajectories of multiple particles.","Yoon, Gil Ho; So, Hongyun",Struct Multidiscipl Optim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838481/,569

45638,Kleinbeeld,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND: Being a newly emerging disease, little is known about its long-lasting post-COVID-19 consequences. The aim of this work is to assess the frequency, patterns, and determinants of persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the value of a proposed novel COVID-19 symptom score. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in a hospital-based registry were included in a cross-sectional study (the hospitals including Assiut University Hospital, Assiut Chest Hospital, Aswan University Hospital, and Aswan Specialized Hospital). The patient demographics, comorbid disorders, the mean duration since the onset of the symptoms, history of hospital or ICU admittance, and the treatment taken during the acute state, as well as symptom score before and after convalescence, were recorded. RESULTS: The most frequent constitutional and neurological symptoms were myalgia (60.0%), arthralgia (57.2%), restriction of daily activities (57.0%), and sleeping troubles (50.9%), followed by anorexia (42.6%), chest pain (32.6%), gastritis (32.3%), cough (29.3%), and dyspnea (29.1%). The mean total score of acute stage symptoms was 31.0 ± 16.3 while post-COVID 19 symptom score was 13.1 ± 12.6 (P < 0.001). The main determinants of the persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms were the need for oxygen therapy (P < 0.001), pre-existing hypertension (P = 0.039), chronic pulmonary disorders (P = 0.012), and any chronic comorbidity (P = 0.004). There was a correlation between the symptom score during the acute attack and post-COVID-19 stage (P < 0.001, r = 0.67). The acute phase score had 83.5% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity for the cutoff point > 18 to predict occurrence of post-COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can present with a diverse spectrum of long-term post-COVID-19 symptoms. Increased acute phase symptom severity and COVID-19 symptom score > 18 together with the presence of any comorbid diseases increase the risk for persistent post-COVID-19 manifestations and severity.","Galal, Islam; Hussein, Aliae A.

45926,Testing as an approach to control the Corona epidemic dynamics and avoid lockdowns,2021-02-19,"Neoliberalism has been key term of political and academic debate since the 1990s. Nevertheless, in spite of this centrality, the concept remains vague and highly contested. An influential approach to grasp neoliberalism is the governmentality approach. Nonetheless, academics have pointed to the limitations of using Foucault’s oeuvre on governmentality for understanding neoliberalism. In particular, they have urged to develop a more sober assessment of the theoretical possibilities of using Foucault’s method and concepts to understand (the hegemony of) globalized neoliberalism. In this article, I argue that Foucault’s method on governmentality is far from a limitation in social science. The latter deals with the study of social change. Scholars who want to study social change have to deal with an important epistemological problem: how to study social change without presupposing a certain outcome. Or how to study social change without feeding the hegemonic beast (neoliberalism) you want to slay in the first place? Starting from the argument that we have to go beyond neoliberalism in social theory, this article deals with the question how this could be achieved. I argue that Foucault’s (extended) notion of governmentality (taking into account the notion of counter-conduct) is a methodological concretization of the work of Leitner and colleagues who developed a research agenda in order to decenter neoliberalism in the analysis of contestation and change.","Rondelez, Pieter",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882247/,569

RECENT FINDINGS: The most relevant advances in the study of these arboviruses’ infections have been in the epidemiological distribution, mainly due to international travel, migration, and climate change; in the clinical manifestations of these diseases, the development of clinical decision-making software, which can help improve the management and outcomes of these patients; and in the prevention of this disease. SUMMARY: Although arboviruses infections constitute a clinical challenge for the attending physician in the scope of a febrile returning traveler, a thorough clinical history and exam can help to aid diagnostic reasoning. The characteristics of the rash are a very helpful clue in the evaluation of these patients. Currently, there are clinical decision aid tools that help to get the diagnosis more quickly.","Wong, Eduardo; Suárez, José Antonio; Naranjo, Laura; Castrejón-Alba, María Mercedes",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900380/,569
46227,The Creative Synthesis and the Global Psychology,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND: Good sleep hygiene plays an important role in human health. Medical students are notorious for insufficient and irregular sleep habits which are linked with students' learning abilities, poor academic performance, and poor interpersonal relationship which predispose them to mental illnesses. However, it has not been studied among medical students in Ethiopia. METHOD: This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 576 undergraduate medical students selected by using a stratified sampling technique. Sleep hygiene (SHI) was assessed by a 13-item sleep hygiene questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the potential determinants of poor sleep hygiene among undergraduate medical students. Variables with p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the strength of the association was presented by adjusted odds ratio with 95% C.I. RESULT: The prevalence of poor sleep hygiene practice among undergraduate medical students was 48.1% (95% 43.7, 52.1). After adjusting for the possible confounders, being female (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.03, 2.26), having depressive symptoms (AOR = 3.55, 95% CI 2.26, 5.59), with stress symptoms (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI 1.61, 3.60), and having anxiety symptoms (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.42, 3.31) were associated with poor sleep hygiene practice at p value < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the medical students had poor sleep hygiene practice. Routine screening of depressive and stress symptoms and education about sleep hygiene are warranted among medical students.","Molla, Alemayehu; Wondie, Tirusew",Sleep Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7902132/,569

47589,The Impact of Visual Communication in COVID-19’s Prevention and Risk Mitigation,2020-09-19,"Contemporary organizations function in a complex business and operational environment composed of closely interdependent systems. They are also complex by their internal structure, management and deployed modern technologies. This complexity is not always well understood, and cannot be efficiently controlled. As the complexity and interdependencies increase, man-made systems become more unstable creating conditions for cascading, system-level failures causing serious threats to both themselves and society in general. Such breakdowns may consist of a) serious physical damages and destruction of their physical assets (caused by natural disasters, extreme weather phenomena and climate change, malicious human actions, etc.), and/or b) large functional disruptions with no physical damages of assets (caused by major organization’s internal disturbances, market crashes, pandemics, disruptions of supply chains, etc.). Those sources of risks are basically external to organizations. They are unable to control them, but are deeply affected by those risks. The latest case of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the above. It is affecting both all sectors of life and businesses worldwide. It convincingly shows that we need to think, plan and act globally in order to deal with such situations that will also take place in the future. Thus, organizations have to find ways of coping with this reality to remain economically viable. We are of opinion that the concepts of structured Asset Management (AM) and resilience put together may provide an efficient framework in this regard. Two case studies in a major North American electrical utility demonstrate the applicability of this approach: i) during an exceptional ice storm with significant damages of its physical assets, and ii) coping with challenges of COVID-19 with no destruction of its physical assets.","Komljenovic, Dragan",14th WCEAM Proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972113/,569

This includes handling numerous architectural dependencies and requirements as a result of blending a variety of future generation technologies. Examples of recent approaches are proposals of a unified format for medical records to facilitate efficient healthcare provision, transparent data access control using blockchain technology, and emergent authentication mechanisms and privacy-preserving techniques for data analytics. The Serums project proposes an innovative design for a Smart Health Centre System in a distributed development effort. The goal is a comprehensive solution for integration and access of transnational medical records. This paper focuses on the architectural design workflow as a way of delivering artefacts for development iterations and contribute towards module integration planning in the software development process. Our experience shows that in data integration projects for healthcare provision, system architects and developers can profit from the designed viewpoints as artefacts to reveal integration challenges and highlight quality attributes.","Webber, Thais; Santana, Juan Mendoza; Vermeulen, Andreas Francois; Bowles, Juliana K.

The project aims to support participants to become aware of Industry 4.0 related topics such as machine learning, data mining, industrial automation, human-machine interface, and product life cycle, and to stimulate the curiosity of them towards these topics. The scope of the project consists of presentations, experimental applications, observations, individual and collaborative studies, assessment and evaluation practices, e-learning applications, and a social program. The project was conducted as a one- week program at a public university in Turkey with the participation of 18 undergraduate 3rd-year students. Participants consist of students from computer engineering and software engineering departments of the engineering faculties and the business department of the faculty of economics and administrative sciences. Thus, participants of the project had the opportunity to exchange information with students and faculty members from different academic backgrounds. The study utilized the mixed methods approach by performing both quantitative and qualitative measurements. To collect data, mini projects and project evaluation forms were used for quantitative measurements and daily virtual classroom sessions and a general evaluation session (focus group interview) were used for qualitative measurements. The success rates of the participants based on the evaluation of the reports they presented were obtained as 91% in data mining, 95% in industrial automation and human-machine interface, and 89% in machine learning course, respectively. It was observed that the overall satisfaction level of the participants from the project activities was over 95%. These findings were also supported by the qualitative findings as the students indicated their overall satisfaction from the organization of the project and stated that working in teams and attending the social program contributed to developing positive relationships with each other and increasing their success.","Inceoglu, Mustafa M.; Ciloglugil, Birol",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978600/,569

These two battles marked a final stage of the showdown between protestors and police. The confrontations at the PolyU led to the defeat of many radical protestors, who were arrested, surrendered to the police or escaped. After the battle at the PolyU, the protest movement has died down although it has been lingering on since early 2020. The outbreak of Covid-19 in China in February 2020 and then in Hong Kong from late February onward have become the dampers minimizing the quantity of protests. The whole protest movement became far more moderate than ever before when District Council elections were held on November 25, when the democrats won many of the directly elected seats. The elections were functional as they provided safety-valves for the disgruntled citizens to vent their anger through the exercise of their ballots. On the other hand, the US Congress passed the US Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was then signed into law by President Trump.

This traditional paradigm is not inherently better than a more equitable one that accounts for the unique contributions of women physicians as well as the demands and biases facing them. A more inclusive approach has the potential to generate superior outcomes within our industry, incentivize the right types of care, and engage the full talents of a considerable portion of the workforce. Closing the gender pay gap is achievable with organizational commitment and openness to culture and process change. It also requires funding, especially up front. Our road map emphasizes the importance of robust salary studies and efforts to clarify how the cost of equity will be forecasted, managed, and monitored. Closing the gender pay gap is a business proposition and, by treating it with the same attention to detail and rigor as they do other operating expenses, organizations can assess progress and cost and also normalize it as an ongoing enterprise effort.","Gottlieb, Amy S.",Closing the Gender Pay Gap in Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991112/,569

The emphasis is on the digitization of service operational processes and their impacts. This is a tension between the role service workers play in creating and delivering service experiences through face-to-face encounters versus the substitution of service workers by technology. On the one hand, service customization and the quality of a service experience is still founded around interactions between service producers and service consumers. On the other hand, there is the emergence of service encounters in which service workers are a hidden rather than a visible part of the service experience.

This chapter explores the ways in which demographers and other social scientists have sought to understand the relationships that occur in a full range of population dynamic changes and environmental changes that now characterize contemporary Nepal. In addition, it also explains how ecosystem services have been deteriorating in Nepal with many working-age people out-migrating each day to acquire jobs that provide them and their families back home with remittances. Also explained are the ways in which this trend of emigration distorting the traditional families’ social cohesion and how various government policies and programs have been ineffective to address the resultant population-environmental dilemmas. This chapter serves as the preliminary foundation for the remaining chapters that follow in order to link various demographic issues with the location-specific socioeconomic conditions and environment.","Bhattarai, Keshav; Conway, Dennis",Contemporary Environmental Problems in Nepal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991433/,569
50900,SMEs’ line of credit under the COVID-19: evidence from China,2021-03-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Routinely collected data on the performance of dairy cows are a valuable source of information on the beginning, course, and completion of their productive life. As a result, when using sufficiently accurate methods, one can analyze and optimize the milk production process at a herd level from the breeding and economic point-of-view. In this context, it is important to have a possibility to early predict culling reasons for cows, since, in the case of finding an effective method, it would be possible to modify breeding actions and farm management practices without anticipating the end of the animals’ productive lives. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks and a general discriminant analysis may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation data. It turned out that they were most effective in predicting culling due to old age and reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks (ANN) may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation records. Data on Holstein-Friesian cows culled in Poland between 2017 and 2018 were used in the present study. A general discriminant analysis (GDA) was applied as a reference method for ANN. Considering all predictive performance measures, ANN were the most effective in predicting the culling of cows due to old age (99.76–99.88% of correctly classified cases). In addition, a very high correct classification rate (99.24–99.98%) was obtained for culling the animals due to reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. The correct classification rate for individual culling reasons obtained with GDA (0.00–97.63%) was, in general, lower than that for multilayer perceptrons (MLP). The obtained results indicated that, in order to effectively predict the previously mentioned culling reasons, the following first-lactation parameters should be used: calving age, calving difficulty, and the characteristics of the lactation curve based on Wood’s model parameters.","Adamczyk, Krzysztof; Grzesiak, Wilhelm; Zaborski, Daniel",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998856/,569

These relationships are still not examined in the Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of alcohol consumption and maternal diet during pregnancy on maternal and infant’s gut microbiota. (2) Methods: Twenty-nine mother-child dyads were enrolled in central China. Fecal samples of mothers during late pregnancy and of newborns within 48 h were collected. The V3–V4 regions of 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed. A self-administrated questionnaire about simple diet frequency in the past week was completed by mothers before childbirth. The demographic information was finished by mothers at 24 h after childbirth. (3) Results: Among these 29 mothers, 10 mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The PCoA (β-diversity) showed significant difference in maternal gut microbiota between the alcohol consumption group vs. the non-alcohol consumption group (abund-Jaccard, r = 0.2, p = 0.006). The same phenomenon was observed in newborns (unweighted-UniFrac full tree, r = 0.174, p = 0.031). Maternal alcohol consumption frequency showed positive associations with maternal Phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.032) and Blautia (p = 0.019); maternal Faecalibacterium (p = 0.013) was negatively correlated with frequency of alcohol consumption. As for newborns, a positive relationship showed between Megamonas (p = 0.035) and newborns with maternal alcohol consumption. The diet was not associated with both maternal and infant’s gut microbiota. (4) Conclusions: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy influenced the gut microbiota on both mothers and the newborns. Future research is needed to explore these relationships in a lager birth cohort. Understanding the long-term effect of alcohol consumption on maternal and newborns’ gut microbiota is needed.","Wang, Ying; Xie, Tianqu; Wu, Yinyin; Liu, Yanqun; Zou, Zhijie; Bai, Jinbing",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001387/,569
50955,Purchase of government bonds by a supranational central bank: its impact on business cycles,2021-03-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis and tends to develop peritoneal dissemination. It is becoming increasingly clear that mesothelial cells that cover the peritoneal cavity are involved in ovarian cancer progression. Mesothelial cells are numerous in the peritoneal cavity and normally play many functions to maintain the peritoneal environment. In the tumor microenvironment, mesothelial cells that gain mesenchymal features and cooperate with ovarian cancer are called ovarian cancer-associated mesothelial cells, and they must help ovarian cancer cells to adhere to the peritoneum, invade, and disseminate. Elucidating and targeting these processes may improve the prognosis of ovarian cancer, which is difficult to cure. ABSTRACT: Ovarian cancer has one of the poorest prognoses among carcinomas. Advanced ovarian cancer often develops ascites and peritoneal dissemination, which is one of the poor prognostic factors. From the perspective of the “seed and soil” hypothesis, the intra-abdominal environment is like the soil for the growth of ovarian cancer (OvCa) and mesothelial cells (MCs) line the top layer of this soil. In recent years, various functions of MCs have been reported, including supporting cancer in the OvCa microenvironment. We refer to OvCa-associated MCs (OCAMs) as MCs that are stimulated by OvCa and contribute to its progression. OCAMs promote OvCa cell adhesion to the peritoneum, invasion, and metastasis. Elucidation of these functions may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can delay OvCa progression, which is difficult to cure.","Mogi, Kazumasa; Yoshihara, Masato; Iyoshi, Shohei; Kitami, Kazuhisa; Uno, Kaname; Tano, Sho; Koya, Yoshihiro; Sugiyama, Mai; Yamakita, Yoshihiko; Nawa, Akihiro; Tomita, Hiroyuki; Kajiyama, Hiroaki",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8002484/,569
51032,Environment Practices Mediating the Environmental Compliance and firm Performance: An Institutional Theory Perspective from Emerging Economies,2021-03-31,"INTRODUCTION: Since the emergence of COVID 19 in December 2019, its clinical and radiological features are still being discovered and their prognostic implications evaluated. Chest X-ray (CXR) typically shows patchy or diffuse asymmetric airspace opacities. Regardless of the different classifications of radiological findings that have been used, it is becoming clear that multi-lobar changes in the lungs are associated with poorer outcomes than single lobar involvement or minimal/no radiological abnormalities. Aim: To assess the correlation of age with the extent of CXR findings in hospitalized COVID 19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was carried out on inpatients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID 19. Chest X-ray findings were classified as minimal/no radiological changes, single lobar opacification and multi-lobar changes (involving 2 or more lobes and/or ARDS changes). SPSS 26 software was used for statistical analysis. Spearman’s correlation and linear regression were used to assess correlation. RESULTS: 211 patients were included in the analysis; 124 males and 87 females. Mean age of the patients was 72.4 years; SD +/−16.15. There was significant positive correlation between age and degree and extent of radiological changes in all patients (r = 0.367; p < 0.01). This correlation persisted even when broken down by gender (r = 0.448; p < 0.01) for males and (r = 0.322; p < 0.01) for females. Discussion: Older age has been repeatedly reported as a risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID 19. The main findings of COVID-19 on CXR are those of atypical or organizing pneumonia. Older people tend to have more extensive involvement of the lungs. There could be many explanations for the CXR correlation with age including the diminished cardiovascular reserve with ageing, the accumulation of comorbidities and decreased or abnormal immune response. CONCLUSION: Age significantly correlate with the extent of chest radiographic findings in inpatients with COVID 19.","Fernandez, A; Michael, A; Obiechina, N; Nandi, A; Koh, J",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989602/,569

51114,How to save the world during a pandemic event. A case study of frugal innovation,2021-02-17,"Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) belongs to a class of highly homologous Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. Its structure consists of a core region composed of four homologous repeats arranged in a compact, hydrolysis-resistant structure and an N-terminal region with a Ca(2+)-dependent conformation. ANXA1 is involved in several processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and the inflammatory response. Therefore, the development of antibodies blocking selected regions on ANXA1 holds great potential for the development of novel therapeutics treating inflammatory and cancer diseases. Here, we report the interaction site between an ANXA1-specific antibody known to inhibit T cell activation without adverse cytotoxic effects and ANXA1 using amide hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). For the epitope determination, we applied two bottom-up HDX-MS approaches with pepsin digestion in solution and immobilized on beads. Both strategies revealed the interaction region within domain III of ANXA1 in Ca(2+)-bound conformation. The antibody-binding region correlates with the hydrophobic binding pocket of the N-terminal domain formed in the absence of calcium. This study demonstrates that even cryptic and flexible binding regions can be studied by HDX-MS, allowing a fast and efficient determination of the binding sites of antibodies which will help to define a mode of action profile for their use in therapy.","Gramlich, Marius; Hays, Henry C.

Data generated by more than six thousand students from three different countries who solved more than 1.1 million problem sets using a dedicated mathematics software are analyzed regarding the effect of study time on students’ achievements in mathematics. Results showed that more study time led to higher performance scores in mathematics. Further analyses revealed that low-performing students in the first school year (2017-2018) who increased their study time in the following year (2018-2019) revealed greatest gains in performance in the same school year (2018-2019) and even in the year after (2019-2020). Finally, results replicated previous observations of robust performance scores within students over the three school years, with performance scores in 2017-2018 predicting those of 2018-2019 which predicted those of 2019-2020. These results support the idea that students, in particular low-performing students, can boost their academic abilities to upper levels when increasing their study time.","Spitzer, Markus Wolfgang Hermann",Eur J Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025066/,569

The causation of a positive self-concept created by physical exercise is empirically supported by Sonstroem and Morgan’s (1988) exercise and self-esteem model (EXSEM). However, various drawbacks of maintaining high self-esteem have been identified; thus, the concept of self-compassion was conjectured to be a form of “true self-esteem.” Hence, the current study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity and self-compassion by examining the exercise and self-esteem model revised with self-compassion (EXSEM-SC).

We describe a community-based program to manage stress and reduce depressive symptoms among low-income Spanish-speaking Latinos. Methods: Mentes Positivas en Acción (MPA) (Positive Minds in Action) is an 8-week group program, delivered by trained promotores in community settings and evaluated through a randomized feasibility study. Participants were randomly assigned to an immediate MPA treatment group or a delayed-intervention control group. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 8 weeks included stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9); higher scores indicate worse health. Repeated-measures analysis of variance examined group×time interaction effects for group differences in change from baseline to 8 weeks. The control group offered the program after the 8-week assessment, completed an additional assessment at the end of the program (16 weeks); t-tests assessed within-group changes. Results: Most participants were female, born in Mexico, and spoke only Spanish. Group×time interaction effects were significant for both outcomes. Mean PSS scores improved in the treatment group but not the control group (−0.80 vs. +0.10; p<0.014). Mean PHQ-9 scores improved more in the treatment group than the control group (−5.7 vs. −0.3; p<0.011). Within-group analyses of the control group found significant improvements in stress (−0.8; p<0.000) and depressive symptoms (−3.9; p<0.002).

INTRODUCTION: Despite the established benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), it remains significantly underutilized. Home-based CR (CR-HB) programs should offer the same core CR components as Centre-based programs (CR-CB) but several aspects need to be adapted, communication and supervision must be improved. Although CR-HB has been successfully deployed and is a valuable alternative to CR-CB, there is less structured experience with these non-uniform programs and further studies are needed to understand which patients (pts) are indicated to this type of program. PURPOSE: To investigate pt-perceived facilitators and barriers to home-based rehabilitation exercise. METHODS: Prospective cohort study which included pts who were participating in a CR-CB program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB program after CR-CB closure due to COVID-19. The CR-HB consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including pt risk evaluation and regular assessment, exercise, educational and psychological sessions. The online exercise training sessions consisted of recorded videos and real time online supervised exercise training group sessions. It was recommended to do each session 3 times per week, during 60 min. A pictorial exercise training guidebook was available to all participants including instructions regarding safety, clothing and warm-up, and a detailed illustrated description of each exercise sessions. Also, for questions or difficulties regarding the exercises, an e-mail and telephone was provided. Once a month, real time CR exercise sessions was provided with a duration of 60min. RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease pts (62.6 ± 8.9years, 95 males) who were attending a face-to-face CR program were included in a CR-HB program. The majority of the pts had coronary artery disease (89%) and 5% valvular disease. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most common (75%) followed by hypertension (60%), family history (42%), dyslipidaemia (38%), diabetes (18%), and smoking (13%). Almost half (47%) of the participants did at least one online exercise training session per week: 58% did 2-3 times per week, 27% once per week and 15% more than 4 times per week. Participants who did less than one exercise session per week reported as cause: lack of motivation (38%), preference of a different mode of exercise training such as exercise in the exterior space (26%), technology barrier such as impossibility to stream online videos (11%), fear of performing exercise without supervision (4%), and limited space at home (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study based on real-life results of a CR-HB program shows a sub-optimal rate of participation in exercise sessions due to different causes, but mainly for the lack of motivation to exercise alone or preference for walking in exterior space. The knowledge of the CR-HB program barriers will facilitate to find out strategies to increase the participation rate and to select the best candidates for this type of programs.","Brito, J; Aguiar-Ricardo, I; Alves Da Silva, P; Valente Da Silva, B; Cunha, N; Couto Pereira, S; Silverio Antonio, P; Pinto, R; Lemos Pires, M; Santos, O; Sousa, P; J Pinto, F; Breu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136068/,569

The main explanatory variable is a measure of exposure to trauma at two levels of proximity (experiencing and witnessing). Resilience is investigated as a potential effect modifier. Experiencing and witnessing traumatic events are positively and significantly associated with PTSD and depression. However, this effect is only seen for PTSD as a continuous measure, reflecting high rates of low-level PTSD in this population.

These conditions have created an optimal environment for the emergence of opportunistic infections, which is concomitant to the increase in antifungal resistance. The use of conventional antifungal drugs as azoles and polyenes can lead to clinical failure, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Difficulties related to treating fungal infections combined with the time required to develop new drugs, require urgent consideration of other therapeutic alternatives. Drug repurposing is one of the most promising and rapid solutions that the scientific and medical community can turn to, with low costs and safety advantages. To treat life-threatening resistant fungal infections, drug repurposing has led to the consideration of well-known and potential molecules as a last-line therapy. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of current antifungal compounds and their main resistance mechanisms, following by an overview of the antifungal activity of non-traditional antimicrobial drugs. We provide their eventual mechanisms of action and the synergistic combinations that improve the activity of current antifungal treatments.

Adjustments of Asian business to shock events,2021-06-11,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between moving in with family during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in food consumption among college students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from 2,012 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who completed an online survey about how their food situation has been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey data were collected in June and July of 2020 and the questionnaire asked about student experiences during the spring 2020 semester up to March 6 (pre-COVID-19), which was when the university went on Spring break and transitioned to remote learning thereafter, and after March 6 (during COVID-19). Changes in food consumption were assessed using questions adapted from the Nurse's Health Study COVID-19 Baseline Questionnaire. Students were asked if they moved in with family during the pandemic. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association between moving in with family during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in consumption of certain types of foods. Models were adjusted for potential covariates and statistical significance was considered P < .05. RESULTS: In adjusted models, moving in with family was associated with decreased consumption of frozen prepared meals (P < .05), canned or frozen fruits (P < .05), canned or frozen vegetables (P < .05), whole grain foods (P < .05) and increased consumption of sugary drinks (P < .05), fresh fruits (P < .01), fish and seafood (P < .001), and red meat (P < .001). There were no significant associations between moving home and consumption of fast foods; alcohol; sweetened foods like candies, brownies, ice creams, muffins, and cakes; snacks like popcorn and potato chips; and fresh vegetables (not including potatoes) in the adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Where college students live may influence if and how the types of foods they consume changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Studying National Responses to a Global Pandemic in Europe,2021-04-28,"The early prevention project “Strong together!” supports refugee parents and their young children (0–4 years) in Berlin, Germany. It aims to mitigate the transmission of trauma to the generation born in exile. For refugee families who have only recently arrived in Germany, the COVID‐19 pandemic poses a particularly great challenge. Not only are they confronted with numerous challenges in respect to re‐building their lives in Germany after fleeing war and persecution, but are also vulnerable to conscious and unconscious anxieties, fantasies, and conflicts evoked by the pandemic and the threat it poses to their lives. This was observed in the context of the mother–child groups of “Strong together!”. Many expressed great insecurity, heightened levels of anxiety, re‐experiencing of traumatic scenes, and over‐strictly self‐isolating themselves and their children, even attraction to fundamentalist ideologies. In this paper, some of the empirical and clinical findings of “Strong together!” are summarized and reflected on within a framework of psychoanalytic trauma theory.","Schestag, Lena; Mehner‐Gentner, Janina; Stein, Lea; Rossi, Hildegard; Fischmann, Tamara; Leuzinger‐Bohleber, Marianne; Fritzemeyer, Korinna",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239545/,569

An empirical evidence from Indian states,2021-07-01,"Technology‐driven control measures could be an important tool to control the COVID‐19 pandemic crisis. This study evaluates the potentiality of emerging technologies such as 5G and 6G communication, Deep Learning (DL), big data, Internet of Things (IoT) etc. for controlling the COVID‐19 transmission and ensuring health safety. The healthcare sector is able to provide a unified, rapid, and incessant service to people by applying modern wireless connectivity tools like 5G or 6G during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This study has identified eight key areas of applications for the COVID‐19 management like infection detection; travel history analysis; identification of infection symptoms; early detection; transmission identification; access to information in lockdown; movement of people; and development of medical treatments and vaccines. Data have been collected from the respondents living in Sakaka city, KSA during pandemic. This study reveals that most people receive information from social networking sites, health professionals, and television without facing any challenges. The analysis shows that, during the COVID‐19 pandemic, about 42% of respondents felt tense always or most of the time in a day. Only 28.6% of respondents felt tense sometimes, whereas the remainder (about 30%) did not feel tense in relation to the COVID‐19 crisis. Satisfaction with COVID‐19‐related information is also positively correlated with COVID‐19‐related information literacy (r = 0.53, p < 0.01) that is also positively correlated with depression or emotion, anxiety, and stress (r = ‐0.15, p < 0.05).

These systems typically present drawbacks as high initial investments and occupancy of wide areas. In this study, a novel energy wall system is proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional geothermal applications in urban areas. The system is characterized by ease of installation, low initial costs and applicability to existing buildings undergoing energy retrofitting. The paper illustrates the implementation of the prototype of such a system to an existing structure in Torino (Italy). An overview of the components is given together with the interpretation of an illustrative test carried out in heating mode. The data from both heating and cooling experimental campaigns allow us to highlight the potential of the proposed technology. The results suggest that an average thermal power of about 17 W per unit area can be exchanged with the ground in heating mode, while an average of 68 W per unit area is exchanged in cooling operations. The negligible impact on the stress–strain state of the wall and the surrounding soil thermal and hygrometric regime is also testified by the results collected. These aspects are associated with a reduced probability of interferences with other installations in highly urbanized areas, easiness of installation and affordable cost.","Baralis, Matteo; Barla, Marco",Int J Energy Environ Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254861/,569

56232,Adoption of digital technologies and backshoring decisions: is there a link?,2021-07-28,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Despite the existence of powerful therapeutic agents, cancer is still an incurable disease in many clinical scenarios. In this regard, nanomedicine and particularly polymeric nanoparticles have raised attention as a manner to improved drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles can optimize existent compounds or be used to improve the formulation for novel therapeutics. In this article the advantages and disadvantages of polymeric nanoparticles will be discussed, and current nanodevices, raw materials for their formulation, methods of formulation, and polymeric nanoparticles in clinical investigations will be reviewed. Finally, options for improvement and clinical applications will be suggested. ABSTRACT: Many therapeutic agents have failed in their clinical development, due to the toxic effects associated with non-transformed tissues. In this context, nanotechnology has been exploited to overcome such limitations, and also improve navigation across biological barriers. Amongst the many materials used in nanomedicine, with promising properties as therapeutic carriers, the following one stands out: biodegradable and biocompatible polymers. Polymeric nanoparticles are ideal candidates for drug delivery, given the versatility of raw materials and their feasibility in large-scale production. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles show great potential for easy surface modifications to optimize pharmacokinetics, including the half-life in circulation and targeted tissue delivery. Herein, we provide an overview of the current applications of polymeric nanoparticles as platforms in the development of novel nanomedicines for cancer treatment. In particular, we will focus on the raw materials that are widely used for polymeric nanoparticle generation, current methods for formulation, mechanism of action, and clinical investigations.","Niza, Enrique; Ocaña, Alberto; Castro-Osma, José Antonio; Bravo, Iván; Alonso-Moreno, Carlos",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304499/,569

INTRODUCTION: To respond to the challenges of COVID-19 and based on evidence confirming low rates of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) occurring between 24- and 48-hours post AMI (Acute Myocardial Infarction), we sought to design and implement a novel Early Hospital Discharge (EHD) pathway AIM: The goal of the EHD protocol is to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk AMI patients who can be safely discharged between 24 and 48 hours after successful primary PCI, aiming to provide a safe discharge for low risk patients, reduce length of stay enhance the follow up of patients post AMI Methodology : Project was designed a QI project and patients were discharged with a structured follow up at 48 hours , 2 weeks and 8 weeks and with a interventional cardiologist at 3 months Virtual follow up was conducted using a bespoke application enable a 2 way messaging and video consultation Patients with AMI are taken for primary PCI in an unselected manner which includes post cardiac arrest, intubated and ventilated patients Results :The median follow-up was 201 days (OQR: 98-268 days). In the early discharge group, there were 2 deaths (0.5%), both due to COVID-19 (both >30 days after d/c) with 0% cardiovascular mortality (comparator group 5% mortality, 2.5% cardiovascular Overall, this resulted in a significant reduction in the overall length of stay for all patients presenting with STEMI undergoing primary PCI over the time period. The median length of stay was 3 days (IQR 2-5 days) from October 2019 to March 2020 before the pathway was introduced. Following the pathway introduction, from April 2020 to February 2021 the median length of stay was 2 days (1-4 days) (p < 0.0001), significantly reduced from pre pathway introduction Conclusion :Driven by the necessity to adapt to the pandemic, we report the safe and successful implementation of an early post MI discharge pathway with an integrated and structural multidisciplinary virtual follow up schedule. This has shortened hospital admission times, decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections and optimised resource utilization, while at the same time enhancing the quality of post discharge care with high levels of patient satisfaction.","Comer, K; Casey-Gillman, O; Moore, E; Adey, S; Mower, S",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344792/,569

Here, primary microglia from adult AD (5xFAD) mice were utilized to demonstrate that 5xFAD microglia fail to degrade Aβ and express low levels of autophagy cargo receptor NBR1. In 5xFAD mouse brains, we show for the first time that AD microglia express elevated levels of microRNA cluster Mirc1/Mir17-92a, which is known to downregulate autophagy proteins. By in situ hybridization in post-mortem AD human tissue sections, we observed that the Mirc1/Mir17-92a cluster member miR-17 is also elevated in human AD microglia, specifically in the vicinity of Aβ deposits, compared to non-disease controls. We show that NBR1 expression is negatively correlated with expression of miR-17 in human AD microglia via immunohistopathologic staining in human AD brain tissue sections. We demonstrate in healthy microglia that autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 is required for Aβ degradation. Inhibiting elevated miR-17 in 5xFAD mouse microglia improves Aβ degradation, autophagy, and NBR1 puncta formation in vitro and improves NBR1 expression in vivo. These findings offer a mechanism behind dysfunctional autophagy in AD microglia which may be useful for therapeutic interventions aiming to improve autophagy function in AD.","Estfanous, Shady; Daily, Kylene P.; Eltobgy, Mostafa; Deems, Nicholas P.; Anne, Midhun N.

We present safety and efficacy data of a 10-year cohort of 45 pediatric patients who underwent PBSC collection for backup and/or purification of CD34(+) cells for ex vivo gene transfer. Median age was 3.7 years and median weight 15.8 kg. After mobilization with lenograstim/plerixafor (n = 41) or lenograstim alone (n = 4) and 1−3 cycles of leukapheresis, median collection was 37 × 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg.

Patients who collected ≥7 and ≥13 × 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg in the first cycle had pre-apheresis circulating counts of at ≥42 and ≥86 CD34(+) cells/μL, respectively. Weight-adjusted CD34(+) cell yield was positively correlated with peripheral CD34(+) cell counts and influenced by female gender, disease, and drug dosage. All patients received a GT product above the minimum target, ranging from 4 to 30.9 × 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg.

Previous work suggested that the underlying mechanism is stochastic resonance, amplification of a subthreshold signal by stochastic stimulation. We hypothesized that the mechanism behind the reduction of apnea length may not be a solely stochastic phenomenon, and suggest that a purely deterministic, non-random mechanical stimulation could be equally as effective. Mice and rats were anesthetized, tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated to halt spontaneous breathing. Two miniature motors controlled by a microcontroller were attached around the abdomen. Ventilation was paused, stimulations were applied, and the time to the rodent’s first spontaneous breath (T) was measured. Six spectrally different signals were compared to one another and the no-stimulation control in mice. The most successful deterministic stimulation (D) at reducing apnea was then compared to a pseudo-random noise (PRN) signal of comparable amplitude and frequency. CO(2)%, CO(2) stabilization time (T(s)), O(2) saturation (SpO(2)%), and T were also measured. D significantly reduced T compared to no stimulation for medium and high amplitudes. PRN also reduced T, without a difference between D and PRN. Furthermore, both stimulations significantly reduced T(s) with no significant differences between the respective stimulations. However, there was no effect of D or PRN on SpO(2)%. The lack of differences between D and PRN led to an additional series of experiment comparing the same D to a band-limited white noise (WN) signal in young rats. Both D and WN were shown to significantly reduce T, with D showing statistical superiority in reduction of apnea. We further speculate that both deterministic and stochastic mechanical stimulations induce some form of mechanotransduction which is responsible for their efficacy, and our findings suggest that mechanical stimulation may be effective in treating AOP.

Some studies have found that gut dysbiosis, disturbance of the structure and function of the gut microbiome, disrupts pulmonary immune homeostasis, thus leading to increased disease susceptibility; the gut-lung axis is the primary cross-talk for this communication. Gut dysbiosis is involved in carcinogenesis and the progression of lung cancer through genotoxicity, systemic inflammation, and defective immunosurveillance. In addition, the gut microbiome harbors the potential to be a novel biomarker for predicting sensitivity and adverse reactions to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can enhance the efficacy and depress the toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors by regulating the gut microbiota. Although current studies have found that gut microbiota closely participates in the development and immunotherapy of lung cancer, the mechanisms require further investigation. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiota influencing carcinogenesis and immunotherapy in lung cancer and to provide new strategies for governing gut microbiota to enhance the prevention and treatment of lung cancer.","Liu, Xiangjun; Cheng, Ye; Zang, Dan; Zhang, Min; Li, Xiuhua; Liu, Dan; Gao, Bing; Zhou, Huan; Sun, Jinzhe; Han, Xu; Lin, Meixi; Chen, Jun",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417127/,569

However, gene delivery, particularly through nonviral routes, is inefficient. To address the shortcomings of nonviral gene delivery to hMSCs, our lab has previously demonstrated that pharmacological “priming” of hMSCs with clinically approved drugs can increase transfection in hMSCs by modulating transfection-induced cytotoxicity. However, even with priming, hMSC transfection remains inefficient for clinical applications. This work takes a complementary approach to addressing the challenges of transfecting hMSCs by systematically investigating key transfection parameters for their effect on transgene expression. Specifically, we investigated two promoters (cytomegalovirus [CMV] and elongation factor 1 alpha), four DNA vectors (plasmid, plasmid with no F1 origin, minicircle, and mini-intronic plasmid), two cationic carriers (Lipofectamine 3000 and Turbofect), and four donors of hMSCs from two tissues (adipose and bone marrow) for efficient hMSC transfection. Following systematic comparison of each variable, we identified adipose-derived hMSCs transfected with mini-intronic plasmids containing the CMV promoter delivered using Lipofectamine 3000 as the parameters that produced the highest transfection levels. The data presented in this work can guide the development of other hMSC transfection systems with the goal of producing clinically relevant, genetically modified hMSCs.","Kozisek, Tyler; Hamann, Andrew; Samuelson, Luke; Fudolig, Miguel; Pannier, Angela K.",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8413668/,569

Less well understood is the body image-related emotional processes that might lead to disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, specifically among aesthetic athletic girls. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the role that body image-related cognitive fusion plays in disordered eating, and the mediating role of body image-related perfectionist self-presentation on this relationship, in aesthetic athletic girls. This study comprised 142 young female athletes from aesthetic sports, who completed self-report measures. A path analysis was conducted to explore the proposed theoretical model, while controlling for age and zBMI. The path model revealed an excellent fit and explained 71% of the severity of disordered eating. Results showed that body image-related cognitive fusion influences disordered eating behaviours, through the mechanism of body image-related perfectionist self-presentation, even when controlling for age and zBMI. Findings suggested that, in aesthetic athletic girls, the entanglement in body image-related thoughts may be associated with the need to present a perfect body image to others, which may lead to disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, adopted as a means to control weight and body shape. The present study highlights the relevance of body image-related processes in disordered eating and suggests the importance of educational programmes that target the development of more adaptive emotion regulation strategies concerning body image in athletes, particularly from aesthetic sports.","Paixão, Carolina; Oliveira, Sara; Ferreira, Cláudia",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8426111/,569

Current evidence shows that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective to promote physical and mental health among educated English speakers; nonetheless, the lack of diversity in the mindfulness literature is a considerable limitation. To our knowledge, the feasibility and acceptability of MBIs among Portuguese-speaking immigrants have not yet been investigated. Methods: This single-arm pilot study (N = 30) explored the feasibility, acceptability, and cultural aspects of Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC)-Portuguese among Portuguese-speaking immigrants in the Boston area. MTPC is an 8-week, primary care-adapted, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable, trauma-informed MBI that is fully integrated into a healthcare system. The study also examined intervention preliminary effectiveness on mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety symptoms) and self-regulation (emotional regulation, mindfulness, self-compassion, interoceptive awareness), and initiation of health behavior was explored. Results: Primary care providers referred 129 patients from 2018 to 2020. Main DSM-5 primary diagnoses were depression (76.3%) and anxiety disorders (6.7%). Participants (N = 30) attended a mean of 6.1 (SD 1.92) sessions and reported a mean of 213.7 (SD = 124.3) min of practice per week. All survey finishers would recommend the program to a friend, found the program helpful, and rated the overall program as “very good” or “excellent,” and 93% would participate again, with satisfaction mean scores between 4.6 and 5 (Likert scale 0–5). Participants and group leaders provided feedback to refine MTPC-Portuguese culturally responsiveness regarding materials language, settings, time, food, and community building. Patients exhibited reductions in depression (d = 0.67; p < 0.001) and anxiety (d = 0.48; p = 0.011) symptoms, as well as enhanced emotional regulation (d = 0.45; p = 0.009), and among survey finishers, 50% initiated health behavior change through action plan initiation. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that MTPC-Portuguese is feasible, acceptable, and culturally appropriate among Portuguese-speaking patients in the Boston area.

58163,COVID-19 and environment: a poignant reminder of sustainability in the new normal,2021-09-24,"The increasing trend of food waste is one of the serious challenges throughout the world. The purpose of this study is to investigate the status of edible oil waste (EOW) from farm to table using the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis in Iran (2021). First, semi-structured, interviews were conducted with 11 experts in the edible oil industry. Then a cross-sectional study was done on 40 restaurant managers through telephone interviews about the restaurant’s discarded edible oils. Finally, an online study was undertaken among 121 households regarding their waste cooking oil at home. Two categories in five themes with 20 subthemes were explored based on the participant’s perspectives. Lack of up-to-date knowledge and appropriate technology were the main reasons for making waste from farm to factory. EOW is used optimally in other industries. The results showed that 92% of the restaurants sell the EOW for poultry feeds without refinement. The majority of the households [52%] throw EOW in the garbage and 21% dump their discarded oils in the sewage. By SWOT analysis, the challenges of EOW from farm to table were identified. There is no specific policy plan for collecting and recycling EOW. The waste oil used in poultry feed without refinement can enter the human body and the possible oxidation toxicity of this waste can pose public health risks. Policymakers can use the SWOT analysis for setting laws and regulations for EOW to ensure its safe disposal and promote its use for biodiesel to provide a healthy community.","Salmani, Y.; Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, F.; Esfarjani, F.",J Mater Cycles Waste Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459144/,569

In addition, information regarding psychometric properties was discussed as well. METHODS: Four databases were systematically searched following the PRISMA guidelines and using strict eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the COSMIN checklist. RESULTS: Eight questionnaires were previously used in populations on the autism spectrum, reported over 31 studies. DISCUSSION: Future research should focus more on examining psychometric properties of these self-report measures in this population as current evidence is scarce. In addition, it is important to consider which concept of stress one aims to measure as not all questionnaires cover the same aspects of stress.

Distance Learning at the time of COVID-19 is an educational methodology and it can be considered the only occasion to keep an educational connection between students and teachers. Experimentation in a Mathematics STEM class was carried out evaluating the impact of Distance Learning on students’ levels of motivation, participation, and engagement, computed through a Fuzzy Cognitive Map. Specifically, it was performed on some affective and interaction parameters derived from using an adaptive e-learning platform and from the answers of a semi-structured questionnaire. The results, which have been analysed through Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge and Instrumental Genesis theories, show on one hand that Distance Learning is valid as an additional and support methodology but, on the other hand, they highlight the ineffectiveness of completely remote teaching. Therefore, a teaching method that integrates moments of distance teaching with activities carried out in the presence, in the classroom, or in other university environments, is hoped to be used as soon as the emergency is over: a mix of styles, a fluid flow of knowledge between the physical classroom and the virtual classroom.

58572,COVID-19 and the Political Economy of Shared Adjustment,2021-10-05,"In 2015 the United Nations drafted the Paris Agreement and established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for all nations. A question of increasing relevance is the extent to which the pursuit of climate action (SDG 13) interacts both positively and negatively with other SDGs. We tackle this question through a two-pronged approach: a novel, automated keyword search to identify linkages between SDGs and UK climate-relevant policies; and a detailed expert survey to evaluate these linkages through specific examples. We consider a particular subset of SDGs relating to health, economic growth, affordable and clean energy and sustainable cities and communities. Overall, we find that of the 89 UK climate-relevant policies assessed, most are particularly interlinked with the delivery of SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and that certain UK policies, like the Industrial Strategy and 25-Year Environment Plan, interlink with a wide range of SDGs. Focusing on these climate-relevant policies is therefore likely to deliver a wide range of synergies across SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 7, 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 11, 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). The expert survey demonstrates that in addition to the range of mostly synergistic interlinkages identified in the keyword search, there are also important potential trade-offs to consider. Our analysis provides an important new toolkit for the research and policy communities to consider interactions between SDGs, which can be employed across a range of national and international contexts.

We report 265 consecutive, single-center neurointerventional cases using the Navien guide catheter. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive intracranial endovascular procedures utilizing the Navien catheter. Data collected included procedure type, catheters, guide catheter position, cervical access artery tortuosity grade and complications. Results The 5 French catheter was used in 130 cases. The 6 French catheter was used in 135 cases. Access was via the internal carotid artery in 204, external carotid artery in 10, and vertebral artery in 51 cases. Catheter tip position was in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery in 36.6% (97/265), distal cervical internal carotid artery in 13.9% (37/265), cavernous internal carotid artery in 10.2% (27/265), proximal or mid cervical internal carotid artery in 5.6% (15/265), supraclinoid internal carotid artery in 0.8% (2/265), and intradural vertebral artery in 0.8% (2/265) of cases. Catheter position was not determined in 18.9% (50/265) of cases. Proximal vessel tortuosity (grade B or C) was present in 98 cases (37%), and the catheter was tracked distal to the tortuosity in 93% (91/98) of these cases. The overall success rate without catheter complication was 97% (258/265). The Navien was replaced by another catheter in 1.9% (5/265) of cases. There was one cervical artery dissection (0.4%) and one severe vasospasm (0.4%) necessitating Navien removal. Conclusions The Navien guide catheter provided distal access support for neuroendovascular interventions in nearly all cases, including cases with proximal artery tortuosity, with a low rate of catheter-related complications.","Jindal, Gaurav; Giacon, Luciano; Iyoha, Moronke; Miller, Timothy; Aldrich, Francois; Simard, Marc; Shivashankar, Ravishankar; Gandhi, Dheeraj","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917717575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675348/,569

The feasibility of this endovascular method has not been reported in children. OBJECTIVE To report our experience treating pediatric AVMs with the transvenous approach (TVA). METHODS A cohort of 7 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) who underwent the TVA for cerebral AVMs between January 2012 and January 2014. The TVA was used alone or in conjunction with other arterial approaches in definitive embolization sessions. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, clinical outcomes, and angiographic results were independently assessed. Pial arteriovenous fistulae and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Control angiograms were obtained at 6 months, and curative treatment was determined by the anatomic obliteration of the nidus. RESULTS All patients had anatomic exclusion of the AVM. The mean size was 2 ± 0.6 cm, and hemorrhage was the most common presentation (100%, n = 7). Most AVMs were deeply placed (71%, n = 5), and a proximal approach to the nidus was achieved in all cases. Transvenous embolization alone was performed in 3 patients (43%), whereas combined arterial and venous embolization was required in 4 patients (57%). The mean follow-up period was 20.2 ± 10.5 months. There were no hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events, and venous infarction was not documented. No recurrence was documented. CONCLUSION This is the first report that demonstrates the feasibility of transvenous Onyx embolization of AVMs in the pediatric population. Such a technique may be considered in certain AVMs that meet anatomic criteria in which microsurgery and radiosurgery might not be indicated.","Mendes, George A C; Iosif, Christina; Silveira, Eduardo Pedrolo; Waihrich, Eduardo; Saleme, Suzana; Mounayer, Charbel",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000001057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26457485/,569
62452,The dilemma of herd immunity for COVID-19.,2021-01-02,"The objective of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the effects of meteorological factors on the prevalence and seasonality of common respiratory viruses in China, which has a subtropical climate. A retrospective study was conducted by identifying children admitted to a hospital with acute respiratory infections due to seven common viruses between January 2001 and December 2011. A total of 42,104 nasopharyngeal samples were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses (IV-A and IV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3), and adenovirus (ADV) by direct immunofluorescence assay. Meteorological data were obtained from Suzhou Weather Bureau. Correlations of viral prevalence with meteorological factors were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation and partial correlation. Multivariate time-series analysis including an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalized linear Poisson models was conducted to study the effect of meteorological factors on the prevalence of respiratory virus infection. RSV and IV-A activity showed distinctive winter peak, whereas PIV-3 and ADV peaked in the summer. Incidence of RSV was correlated with low environmental temperature, and PIV-3 only with high temperature. IV-A activity was correlated with both low temperature and high relative humidity. ADV activity was correlated with high total rainfall. In the ARIMA model, RSV-associated hospitalizations were predictable, and the monthly number of RSV cases decreased by 11.25 % (95 % CI: 5.34 % to 16.79 %) for every 1 °C increase in the average temperature. Seasonality of certain respiratory virus may be explained by meteorological influences. The impact of meteorological factors on the prevalence of RSV may be useful for predicting the activity of this virus.","Chen, Zhengrong; Zhu, Yan; Wang, Yuqing; Zhou, Weifang; Yan, Yongdong; Zhu, Canhong; Zhang, Xuelan; Sun, Huipeng; Ji, Wei",Archives of virology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1863-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24114148/,569
62678,Further on the journey in a complex adaptive system: Elaborating CBME.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND FAP (fibroblast activation protein) plays an important role in cardiac wound healing and remodeling. Although initially developed as a theranostic ligand for metastasized cancer, FAPI (FAP inhibitor) tracers have recently been used to study cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction in small-animal models. The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of FAP via FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans in human hearts. METHODS FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 229 patients of 2 consecutive cohorts (modeling cohort: n=185; confirmatory cohort: n=44) suffering from metastasized cancer were analyzed applying the American Heart Association 17-segment model of the left ventricle. Logistic regression models were created using data from the modeling cohort. Multivariate regression models were established using Akaike information criterion in a step-down approach. RESULTS Fourteen percent of patients had preexisting coronary artery disease (n=31), 33% arterial hypertension (n=75), and 12% diabetes mellitus type II (n=28). Forty-three percent had been treated with platin derivatives (n=100), 14% with anthracyclines (n=32), and 10% had a history of prior radiation to the chest (n=23). High left ventricular FAPI signals correlated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio [OR], 4.3, P=0.0029), a focal myocardial signal pattern (OR, 3.9, P=0.0068), diabetes mellitus type II (OR, 4.1, P=0.046), and beta-blocker use (OR, 3.8, P=0.049) in univariate regression models. In a multivariate analysis, increased signal intensity was significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (overweight [OR, 2.6, P=0.023], diabetes mellitus type II [OR, 2.9, P=0.041], certain chemotherapies [platinum derivatives; OR, 3.0, P=0.034], and a history of radiation to the chest [OR, 3.5, P=0.024]). A focal enrichment pattern was more frequently observed in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS FAPI-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans represent a new imaging modality to investigate cardiac FAP. High signal intensities correlate with cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic disease.","Heckmann, Markus B; Reinhardt, Finn; Finke, Daniel; Katus, Hugo A; Haberkorn, Uwe; Leuschner, Florian; Lehmann, Lorenz H",Circulation.

Although the optimal volume of IV fluid is unknown, there is evidence that excessive administration can be deleterious. Static measures of volume status have not proven to be meaningful resuscitative endpoints. Determination of volume responsiveness has putative benefits over static measures, but its effect on outcomes is unknown. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if resuscitation with a volume responsiveness-guided approach leads to improved outcomes in septic patients. Data Sources We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception until April 2018. Study Selection Prospective studies of patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock that compared volume responsiveness-guided fluid resuscitation to standard techniques and reported mortality data. Data Extraction We extracted study details, patient characteristics, volume responsiveness assessment method, and mortality data. Data Synthesis Of the 1,224 abstracts and 31 full-texts evaluated, four studies (total 365 patients) met inclusion criteria. Using random effects modeling, the pooled odds ratio for mortality at time of longest follow-up with a volume responsiveness-guided strategy was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.49-1.54). Pooling of clinical data was not possibly owing to heterogeneity of reporting in individual studies. Conclusions We found no significant difference in mortality between septic patients resuscitated with a volume responsiveness-guided approach compared with standard resuscitative strategies. It remains unclear whether the findings are due to the small sample size or a true lack of efficacy of a volume responsiveness-guided approach.","Ehrman, Robert R; Gallien, John Z; Smith, Reid K; Akers, Katherine G; Malik, Adrienne N; Harrison, Nicholas E; Welch, Robert D; Levy, Phillip D; Sherwin, Robert L",Critical care explorations,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166259/,569

67778,United States aims to curb vaccination injury payouts.,2020-04-10,"Disulfide bonding contributes to the function and antigenicity of many viral envelope glycoproteins. We assessed here its significance for the hepatitis C virus E2 envelope protein and a counterpart deleted for hypervariable region-1 (HVR1). All 18 cysteine residues of the antigens were involved in disulfides. Chemical reduction of up to half of these disulfides was compatible with anti-E2 monoclonal antibody reaction, CD81 receptor binding, and viral entry, whereas complete reduction abrogated these properties. The addition of 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid had no effect on viral entry. Thus, E2 function is only weakly dependent on its redox status, and cell entry does not require redox catalysts, in contrast to a number of enveloped viruses. Because E2 is a major neutralizing antibody target, we examined the effect of disulfide bonding on E2 antigenicity. We show that reduction of three disulfides, as well as deletion of HVR1, improved antibody binding for half of the patient sera tested, whereas it had no effect on the remainder. Small scale immunization of mice with reduced E2 antigens greatly improved serum reactivity with reduced forms of E2 when compared with immunization using native E2, whereas deletion of HVR1 only marginally affected the ability of the serum to bind the redox intermediates. Immunization with reduced E2 also showed an improved neutralizing antibody response, suggesting that potential epitopes are masked on the disulfide-bonded antigen and that mild reduction may increase the breadth of the antibody response. Although E2 function is surprisingly independent of its redox status, its disulfide bonds mask antigenic domains. E2 redox manipulation may contribute to improved vaccine design.","Fenouillet, Emmanuel; Lavillette, Dimitri; Loureiro, Silvia; Krashias, George; Maurin, Guillemette; Cosset, François-Loïc; Jones, Ian M; Barbouche, Rym",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m805221200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18667425/,569

Evaluation and modification of surgical techniques can minimize the complications associated with the lengthy learning curve for this procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's decade-long experience with LRYGB, to determine whether complications decreased with experience and surgical modifications improved perioperative outcomes. METHODS A retrospective review of all procedures performed by a fellowship-trained surgeon (MK) from December 1, 2000, to October 31, 2013, identified patients who underwent LRYGB. We evaluated perioperative outcomes in 1117 patients and examined the impact of modification of surgical techniques on complications. The patients were divided into 4 groups: cases 1-100 (group 1), cases 101-400 (group 2), cases 401-700 (group 3), and cases 701-1117 (group 4). RESULTS Operating time decreased significantly after the initial 100 cases, from 179.1 minutes for group 1 to 122.1 minutes for group 4. With experience, early complication rates improved from 25.0% to 5.0%, but the rates of early reoperation increased from 1.0% to 2.2% over the 4 case groups. Late complication and reoperation rates increased from 4.0% to 10.5%. However, rates of bleeding, early stricture, internal hernia, and wound infection all decreased after the modification of surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS Operating time and early complication rates decreased with operative experience, but late complication and early and late reoperation rates increased. However, after modifications of surgical technique, common complications of LRYGB decreased to rates lower than those reported in several gastric bypass case series in the literature.

After stratifying subjects into HGI quartiles, the highest quartile (Q4) group showed higher age, female ratio, and frequencies of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, bivariate logistic regression model revealed that the Q4 of HGI was a significant predictor of high CAVI (⩾9.0) independent of the presence of diabetes. CONCLUSION High HGI is associated with systemic arterial stiffening independent of hyperglycemia.

METHODS A mixed-methods online survey, assessing broader governance constraints to climate change adaptation (CCA) for public health, was distributed to representatives of national public health associations, and societies of 82 member countries under the World Federation of Public Health Associations. Specific questions relevant to disaster risk management capacities and barriers were analyzed as part of a narrowed focus on the CCA subdomain of emergency preparedness. RESULTS Existence of some technology, infrastructure, and/ or human resources, necessary to develop early warning and other surveillance systems for climate-related health risks was reported by 9 out of 11 responding countries. However, 7 reported persistent limitations and/ or regional discrepancies. Most significant identified barriers to strengthening emergency preparedness at the national level included governance coordination challenges, and, in the case of many developing countries, technical, medical, and human resource shortages.

72330,Age-Friendly Cities During a Global Pandemic.,2020-12-01,"Chronic low-grade white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome in obesity. Here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of mouse WAT perivascular (PDGFRβ+) cells, termed fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs), activate proinflammatory signalling cascades shortly after the onset of high-fat diet feeding and regulate proinflammatory macrophage accumulation in WAT in a TLR4-dependent manner. FIPs activation in obesity is mediated by the downregulation of zinc-finger protein 423 (ZFP423), identified here as a transcriptional corepressor of NF-κB. ZFP423 suppresses the DNA-binding capacity of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by inducing a p300-to-NuRD coregulator switch. Doxycycline-inducible expression of Zfp423 in PDGFRβ+ cells suppresses inflammatory signalling in FIPs and attenuates metabolic inflammation of visceral WAT in obesity.

75088,Bullshit Ability as an Honest Signal of Intelligence.,2021,"OBJECTIVES We studied the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of patients with chronic illnesses and their behavioural responses. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey among outpatients with chronic illnesses in Lahore, Pakistan. RESULTS Four hundred and one participants were surveyed (84% above 50 years of age). One or two chronic illnesses were present in 130 (32%), three or four in 211 (53%) and more than four in 60 (15%). The majority correctly identified the sources of Covid-19 infection and higher risk patients. Of the respondents, 127 (32%) described feeling more vulnerable. Respondents reported a lack of trust in the community response (199; 49.6%) and hospital measures (167; 41.6%) to slow the spread of Covid-19 and 369 (92%) practiced some degree of social distancing. Respondents described negative impacts of lockdown measures on their physical and mental health (235; 58.6% and 262; 65.3%, respectively). Many reported difficulty in getting medical help during the pandemic (302; 75.2%). Half of the respondents (200; 49.8%) felt that delays in receiving care had adversely affected their health.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of patients with severe BPD who were PPV dependent at home and who were enrolled in a university-affiliated home ventilator program between 1984 and 2010. We excluded patients with other comorbidities that could contribute to the development of chronic respiratory failure. We reported the incidence of these children in Indiana and cumulative incidences of survival, liberation from PPV, and decannulation. RESULTS Over 27 years, 628 children were cared for in our home ventilator program. Of these, 102 patients met inclusion criteria: 83 (81.4%) were alive and 19 (18.6%) were deceased. Sixty-nine patients (67.6%) were liberated from PPV, and 97.1% of them were weaned before their fifth birthday, with a median age at liberation of 24 months (interquartile range, 19-33). Similarly, 60 patients (58.8%) were decannulated, of which 96.7% completed this process before their sixth birthday, with a median age at decannulation of 37.5 months (interquartile range, 31.5-45). The incidence of children with chronic respiratory failure secondary to BPD who were PPV-dependent at home in Indiana was 1.23 per 100 000 live births in 1984 and increased to 4.77 per 100 000 live births in 2010. CONCLUSIONS Although extreme prematurity associated with severe BPD necessitating PPV at home carries significant risks of morbidity and mortality, successful liberation from mechanical ventilation and decannulation are likely to occur.","Cristea, A Ioana; Carroll, Aaron E; Davis, Stephanie D; Swigonski, Nancy L; Ackerman, Veda L",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-2990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23918888/,569
78450,Effective nurse leadership in times of crisis.,2020-06-16,"Epithelial barrier cells are proposed to be critical for host defense, and airway epithelial cell capacity for IFN signal transduction is presumed to protect against respiratory viral infection. However, it has been difficult to fully test these concepts given the absence of tools to analyze IFN signaling specific to airway epithelial cells in vivo. To address these issues, we generated a new line of transgenic mice with Cre-driver genes (Foxj1 and Scgb1a1) for a floxed-Stat1 allele (designated Foxj1-Scgb1a1-Cre-Stat1f/f mice) to target the master IFN signal regulator STAT1 in airway epithelial cells and tested these mice for control of infection because of mouse parainfluenza (Sendai) virus and human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Indeed, both types of infections showed increases in viral titers and severity of acute illness in Foxj1-Scgb1a1-Cre-Stat1f/f mice and conventional Stat1-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. In concert, the chronic lung disease that develops after Sendai virus infection was also increased in Foxj1-Scgb1a1-Cre-Stat1f/f and Stat1-/ - mice, marked by airway and adjacent parenchymal immune cell infiltration and mucus production for at least 7 wk postinfection. Unexpectedly, relatively mild EV-D68 infection also progressed to chronic lung disease in Foxj1-Scgb1a1-Cre-Stat1f/f and Stat1 -/- mice but was limited (like viral replication) to airways. The results thereby provide proof-of-concept for a critical role of barrier epithelial cells in protection from acute illness and chronic disease after viral infection and suggest a specific role for airway epithelial cells given the limitation of EV-D68 replication and acute and chronic manifestations of disease primarily to airway tissue.","Zhang, Yong; Mao, Dailing; Keeler, Shamus P; Wang, Xinyu; Wu, Kangyun; Gerovac, Benjamin J; Shornick, Laurie L; Agapov, Eugene V; Holtzman, Michael J",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1801491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804041/,569
81687,An Innovative Virtual Poster Session for Doctor of Nursing Practice Student Project Presentations.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Primary aortic sarcoma often poses diagnostic challenges for pathologists and clinicians because of a very low incidence and controversy over nomenclature and definition. We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma in association with a graft. We also conducted a clinicopathological review of cases of primary aortic sarcomas associated with implanted grafts. CASE REPORT The patient was an 82-year-old woman. She underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) at age 78 because of an aneurysm in the descending aorta. Approximately 4 years after the TEVAR, computed tomography revealed a type II endoleak and expansion of the aneurysm. Her c-reactive protein level rose to 34 mg/dL, and Ga scintigraphy showed 67Ga accumulation at the aneurysm. She had fever up to 39°C, and a stent graft infection was suspected. Despite administration of antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and she died. Postmortem examination identified epithelioid aortic angiosarcoma at the aorta with aneurysm repair and the graft, and the aortic angiosarcoma invaded the left lower lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS Our clinicopathological review revealed that the proper clinical diagnosis was very difficult owing to confusion of aortic sarcoma after the implantation with the infected graft, atypical endoleak, or pseudoaneurysm. The histological diagnosis was ambiguous because immunohistochemical and genetic studies were not adequately conducted. Overall prognosis of aortic sarcoma is poor as most patients die within a year, with no effective treatments. It is hoped that recent projects for genomic medicine will provide useful insights about the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.","Takamura, Kaori; Kobayashi, Hiroshi; Rubin, Brian P; Kondo, Shuhei; Asami, Fuyuki; Aoyagi, Ryuji; Ajioka, Yoichi",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118148/,569

Spanish citizens' attitudes are important in controlling the pandemic. This research assessed attitudes of Spaniards toward COVID-19 in two studies. One (n = 64) was conducted in a shopping centre in Madrid and another (n = 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a 'more responsible' attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) scored lower on compliance with safety measures and perceived need to stay home than older adults. In Study 1, level of compliance, knowing someone at risk, and knowing someone infected predicted 31.2% of the variance in the perceived need to stay home. In Study 2, personal concern, level of compliance, keeping distance from others, and perceived social alarm predicted 28.5% of the variance in perceived need to stay home. Regardless of age and/or gender, Spanish people's personal concern about COVID-19 was less than their perceived social alarm about it. These results might help policy makers in considering public attitudes which could play an important role in controlling the current, and possibly a second, wave of COVID-19.","de la Vega, Ricardo; Ruíz-Barquín, Roberto; Boros, Szilvia; Szabo, Attila",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1791212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623959/,569

Method: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted from January 31st to February 5th at isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were divided into non-survival group （33 cases）and survival group (169 cases)according to the clinical outcomes 5 weeks after admission. Data including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results were obtained. Cardiac injury was defined as serum concentration of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) above 0.04 μg/L. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plotted survival curve and analyze the impact of myocardial injury on the survival outcome of COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 202 patients were included, the age was 63 (51, 70) years old, 88 (43.6%) of them were male, 85 (42.1%) of them had comorbidities, 125 (61.9%) of them were severely to critically ill. Till March 11, 33 patients died, all of them were critically ill patients. The age, proportion of males, comorbidities, respire rate, serum levels of hs-cTnI and incidence of heart failure in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P<0.05). The hospitalization time of non-survival group was significantly shorter than that of survival group (6(4, 9) vs. 32(23, 36), P<0.001). Myocardial injury was an important prognostic factor of COVID-19 (HR=5.382, 95%CI 2.404-12.050, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the presence of myocardial injury was significantly associated with the reduced survival rate among COVID-19 patients (P<0.001).

85240,2-Stage Collaborative Testing Results in Improved Academic Performance and Student Satisfaction in a PreLicensure Nursing Course.,2020-11-12,"In vivo and direct imaging of the murine spinal cord and its vasculature using multimodal (optical and acoustic) imaging techniques could significantly advance preclinical studies of the spinal cord. Such intrinsically high resolution and complementary imaging technologies could provide a powerful means of quantitatively monitoring changes in anatomy, structure, physiology and function of the living cord over time after traumatic injury, onset of disease, or therapeutic intervention. However, longitudinal in vivo imaging of the intact spinal cord in rodent models has been challenging, requiring repeated surgeries to expose the cord for imaging or sacrifice of animals at various time points for ex vivo tissue analysis. To address these limitations, we have developed an implantable spinal cord window chamber (SCWC) device and procedures in mice for repeated multimodal intravital microscopic imaging of the cord and its vasculature in situ. We present methodology for using our SCWC to achieve spatially co-registered optical-acoustic imaging performed serially for up to four weeks, without damaging the cord or induction of locomotor deficits in implanted animals. To demonstrate the feasibility, we used the SCWC model to study the response of the normal spinal cord vasculature to ionizing radiation over time using white light and fluorescence microscopy combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in vivo. In vivo power Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustics were used to directly visualize the cord and vascular structures and to measure hemoglobin oxygen saturation through the complete spinal cord, respectively. The model was also used for intravital imaging of spinal micrometastases resulting from primary brain tumor using fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging. Our SCWC model overcomes previous in vivo imaging challenges, and our data provide evidence of the broader utility of hybridized optical-acoustic imaging methods for obtaining multiparametric and rich imaging data sets, including over extended periods, for preclinical in vivo spinal cord research.","Figley, Sarah A; Chen, Yonghong; Maeda, Azusa; Conroy, Leigh; McMullen, Jesse D; Silver, Jason I; Stapleton, Shawn; Vitkin, Alex; Lindsay, Patricia; Burrell, Kelly; Zadeh, Gelareh; Fehlings, Michael G; DaCosta, Ralph S",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516432/,569

Our aim was to investigate the incidence of HARM in patients with a diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) - fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch and determine the association between this marker and hemorrhagic complications as well as clinical outcome. Patients and Methods We included patients from the Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial who underwent baseline perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). HARM was defined as a hyperintense signal in the cerebrospinal fluid space on FLAIR imaging at 24 h after baseline imaging. We compared baseline characteristics in patients with and without HARM and investigated the association between HARM and any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and parenchymal hematoma (PH) in a multivariate logistic regression. We also explored HARM as an independent predictor of poor outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 3-6 at 90 days. Results HARM was present in 14 of 223 (6%) patients with a DWI-FLAIR mismatch and baseline characteristics were similar in patients with vs without HARM. HARM showed an independent relationship with any HT (OR 6.67; 95%CI 1.72-26.58) and any PH (OR 6.92; 95%CI 1.34-29.49). The rate of HARM was similar in patients with good and poor outcome (5%, p = 0.90). Conclusion In the WAKE-UP trial, the incidence of HARM was only 6% at 24 h.

Psychological treatment of loneliness can be effective, but the evidence base is limited. OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy of 2 internet-based interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IIPT) relative to a wait-list control group and each other. METHODS A total of 170 participants were recruited and randomized to either 9 weeks of ICBT (n = 68), IIPT (n = 68), or a wait-list condition (n = 34). The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale before, during, and after treatment. Secondary measures of psychiatric disorders and quality of life were administered before and after treatment. Follow-up was conducted 4 months after the treatment had ended. Primary outcome data were analyzed using growth curve modeling. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using robust regression models. The trial was preregistered (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03807154). RESULTS The ICBT condition had a significantly greater impact on loneliness compared to the wait-list and IIPT conditions. Effect sizes were moderate to large (Cohen d = 0.71) compared to the wait-list and moderate (d = 0.53) compared to IIPT. The IIPT condition did not differ significantly from the wait-list. Both active treatments led to significant increases in quality of life. Only the ICBT group had significantly lower symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety compared to the wait-list group. Treatment gains were maintained but not improved at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS ICBT can be an efficacious option for alleviating loneliness. The IIPT intervention was not as effective.","Käll, Anton; Bäck, Malin; Welin, Camilla; Åman, Hanna; Bjerkander, Rasmus; Wänman, Matilda; Lindegaard, Tomas; Berg, Matilda; Moche, Hajdi; Shafran, Roz; Andersson, Gerhard",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182552/,569

Forty implants with different macrogeometries (Facility - Cylindrical with spiral-shaped threads; Alvim - Tapered with buttress-shaped threads) were inserted into artificial bone types I-II and III-IV. Surface morphology was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and roughness parameters with Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) before and after insertion (AI). Implant macrogeometry was characterized by LSCM. The chemical composition of bone beds was determined by SEM associated with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy. The amount of Ti released was analyzed with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence. Alvim had greater IT and ISQ than Facility. Bone types I-II require higher IT of implants. Alvim also had greater internal threads angle, higher initial roughness, and significant reduction of roughness AI, compared to Facility. The functional surface height reduced AI, especially in flank and valley of threads. Height of surface roughness of Alvim and Facility implants was similar AI. Implants surface morphology changes and metallic particles on bone beds were observed after implant insertion, mainly into bone types III-IV. Implants inserted into bone types I-II showed less surface damage. Alvim implants released more Ti (37.52 ± 25.03 ppm) than Facility (11.66 ± 28.55 ppm) on bone types III-IV. The implant macrogeometry and bone types affect IT, ISQ, surface damage, and Ti amount released during insertion. Alvim implants were more wear susceptible, releasing higher Ti concentration during insertion into bone types III-IV.","Silva, Gabrielle Alencar Ferreira; Faot, Fernanda; Possebon, Anna Paula da Rosa; da Silva, Wander José; Del Bel Cury, Altair Antoninha",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932754/,569

METHODS AND MATERIALS Seventeen medically inoperable patients with biopsy-proven Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with RFA followed by single fraction HDR brachytherapy. Brachytherapy catheters were inserted immediately after RFA, and one fraction of HDR brachytherapy was delivered on the same day. Doses of brachytherapy ranged from 14.4 to 20 Gy (median, 18 Gy). Patients were followed clinically and radiographically to determine tumor control and toxicity profile. RESULTS Median followup time was 22 months. Of the 17 patients, 3 patients have recurred locally. Each of the patients with local recurrences was originally treated for T2 disease. In total, three of seven cases with T2N0 disease experienced local recurrences, whereas all 9 patients with T1 disease were controlled locally. Five of the 17 patients required a chest tube posttreatment, and 1 patient developed an empyema. There were no deaths within 1 month of treatment.

This article assesses the extent to which the circumstances generated by the Covid-19 pandemic affect the mode of critical care decision-making. It observes that clinical judgment influenced by protocols, algorithms and resource constraints do not lend themselves to full identification with either of the two frameworks familiar to the NHS.

90811,Abdominal Imaging Findings in Critically Ill Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With COVID-19.,2020-12-08,"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological profile of uveitis cases treated at University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho and to identify the presentation pattern of intraocular inflammation on the basis of clinical, anatomical, etiological, and demographic criteria. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted using data from the medical records of 408 patients with active disease who attended the ophthalmology service between March and October 2018. Age, sex, visual acuity at the time of diagnosis, anatomical and etiological diagnoses, the clinical aspect, and the main symptoms reported during anamnesis were described. RESULTS Of the 408 patients in the study, 52% were male and 48% were female. The patients' mean age was 42 years, and most (84%) were between 19 and 64 years old. Anterior uveitis was observed in 37.75% of the patients; posterior uveitis, in 49.75%; panuveitis, in 4.66%; and intermediate uveitis, in 3.43%. Only 18 patients (4.41%) presented with scleritis. Of the 390 patients with anatomical classifications, 76% had known etiologies, with the most prevalent diagnoses being toxoplasmosis (35.4%), followed by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (6.4%), ankylosing spondylitis (5.9%), and syphilis (4.9%). Infectious uveitis corresponded to 49.7% of the patients, while 26.6% of the cases were of noninfectious origin. Anterior uveitis had the highest number of cases classified as idiopathic (49.4%). In the cases of posterior uveitis, the etiology was established 94% of the time. The most frequent symptoms were ocular pain (71.8%) and blurring vision (56.8%). CONCLUSIONS The present study confirmed the historical importance of infectious uveitis in our population, especially ocular toxoplasmosis. Uveitis appears to have no predilection for sex but mainly affects young people of working age, thus generating social and economic consequences. Despite the evolution of diagnostic methods, idiopathic uveitis remains one of the major etiologies. Epidemiological studies point to different presentation patterns of uveitis in different populations, but these may reflect the distinct characteristics of each institution.","Moraes, Henrique Maciel Vieira de; Almeida, Matheus Santos de; Carvalho, Karolyna Andrade de; Biancardi, Ana Luiza; Moraes Junior, Haroldo Vieira de",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20220040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586241/,569

96484,Building a Bridge: A Review of Information Literacy in Nursing Education.,2021-08-01,"Fatigue-related mechanisms induced by low-intensity prolonged contraction in lower-limb muscles are currently unknown. This study investigated central fatigue kinetics in the knee extensors during a low-intensity sustained isometric contraction. Eleven subjects sustained a 10% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) until task failure (TF) with neuromuscular evaluation every 3 min. Testing encompassed transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate maximal voluntary activation (VATMS ), motor evoked potential (MEP) and silent period (SP), and peripheral nerve stimulation to assess M-wave. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was also recorded. MVC progressively decreased up to 50% of the time to TF (i.e. 50%TTF ) then plateaued, reaching ~50% at TF (p < 0.001). VATMS progressively decreased up to 90%TTF then plateaued, the decrease reaching ~20% at TF (p < 0.001). SP were lengthened early (i.e. from 20%TTF ) during the exercise then plateaued (p < 0.01). No changes were reported for MEP evoked during MVC (p = 0.87), while MEP evoked during submaximal contractions decreased early (i.e. from 20%TTF ) during the exercise then plateaued (p < 0.01). RPE increased linearly during the exercise to be almost maximal at TF. M-waves were not altered (p = 0.88). These findings confirm that TF is due to the subjects reaching their maximal perceived effort rather than any particular central event or neuromuscular limitations since MVC at TF was far from 10% of its original value. It is suggested that strategies minimizing RPE (e.g. motivational self-talk) should be employed to enhance endurance performance.","Souron, Robin; Voirin, Anne-Cloé; Kennouche, Djahid; Espeit, Loïc; Millet, Guillaume Y; Rupp, Thomas; Lapole, Thomas",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869360/,569

Surface acoustic wave devices with an interdigitated transducer emitter and multiple reflectors were fabricated on langasite substrates. Both wired and wireless temperature sensing was demonstrated using radar-mode (pulse) detection. Temperature resolution of better than ±0.5°C was achieved between 200°C and 600°C. Oxygen sensing was achieved by depositing a layer of ZnO on the propagation path. Although the ZnO layer caused additional attenuation of the surface wave, oxygen sensing was accomplished at temperatures up to 700°C. The results indicate that langasite SAW devices are a potential solution for harsh-environment gas and temperature sensing.","Zheng, Peng; Greve, David W; Oppenheim, Irving J; Chin, Tao-Lun; Malone, Vanessa","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2012.2190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626038/,569

METHODS While the classical retropharyngeal approach includes about 11 steps, ours is a four-step approach: patient positioning, skin-platysma incision, hyoid bone superolateral dissection and retropharyngeal blunt exposure. We avoid several steps of the classical anterior retropharyngeal approach, particularly dissection of submandibular gland, facial veins, external carotid artery and thyroid artery, bellies of the digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, thyrohyoid membrane and the internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve. RESULTS We have adopted this technique for five patients: two patients had a C2-C3 herniated disk with myelopathy, two patients had unstable Hangman fracture with no bone fusion after 2-month treatment with rigid collar, and one patient had a C2-C3 osteophyte with dysphagia. The intraoperative time needed for reaching the retropharyngeal space was 15 (first case), 9 (second case), 7 min (third case-illustrative case-and fourth case), 8 min (fifth case). No complications occurred. CONCLUSION Our simplification, avoiding several steps, is simple, effective, safe, and rapid and requires a simple learning curve.","De Bonis, Pasquale; Musio, Antonio; Mantovani, Giorgio; Pompucci, Angelo; Visani, Jacopo; Lofrese, Giorgio; Scerrati, Alba","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-020-06521-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648083/,569

Nine-week-old female pigs were subjected to a permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 4 weeks. According to the kind of the graft, the swine subjected to myocardial infarction were divided into the HYAFF(®) 11, MSCs, HYAFF(®) 11/MSCs and untreated groups. The animals were killed 8 weeks after coronary ligation. Scar perfusion, evaluated by Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound echography, was doubled in the HYAFF(®) 11/MSCs group and was comparable with the perfusion of the healthy, non-infarcted hearts. The inflammation score of the MSCs and HYAFF(®) 11/MSCs groups was near null, revealing the role of the grafted MSCs in attenuating the cell infiltration, but not the foreign reaction strictly localized around the fibres of the scaffold. Apart from the inflammatory response, the native tissue positively interacted with the HYAFF(®) 11/MSCs construct modifying the extracellular matrix with a reduced presence of collagene and increased amount of proteoglycans. The border-zone cardiomyocytes also reacted favourably to the graft as a lower degree of cellular damage was found. This study demonstrates that the transplantation in the myocardial infarct area of autologous MSCs supported by a hyaluronan-based scaffold restores blood perfusion and almost completely abolishes the inflammatory process following an infarction. These beneficial effects are superior to those obtained after grafting only the scaffold or MSCs, suggesting that a synergic action was achieved using the cell-integrated polymer construct.","Muscari, Claudio; Bonafè, Francesca; Martin-Suarez, Sofia; Valgimigli, Simond; Valente, Sabrina; Fiumana, Emanuela; Fiorelli, Federico; Rubini, Giuseppe; Guarnieri, Carlo; Caldarera, Claudio Marcello; Capitani, Ombretta; Arpesella, Giorgio; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.12039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23480821/,569

In the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs, disinfection has become an important technical means to block the spread of the virus. By analyzing the characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we studied a series of disinfection technologies for COVID-19. During the outbreak of COVID-19, Jinan Second Center for Disease Control and Prevention disinfected the houses of the cases to be investigated in a community. The effectiveness of the disinfection technology was verified through the process of disinfection preparation, sampling before disinfection, field disinfection, sampling after disinfection and evaluation of disinfection effect. Compared the data before and after disinfection, the killing rate of the total bacterial colonies in the air and on the surface of the object was more than or equal to 90%, and no SARS-CoV-2 was detected after disinfection. The results show that the disinfection effect of the disinfection technology meets the standard. Finally, through the analysis of the wrong way of disinfection and the harm of over disinfection, the importance of scientific disinfection and precise disinfection are emphasized, and the research has a good guiding value for prevention and control of the epidemic.","Zhao, Haoning; Wei, Ling; Sun, Hongyun; Rong, Xuewen",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.7507/1001-5515.202003010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840071/,569

Much experimental evidence demonstrates that ALV-J mutants have caused immune evasion and pose a challenge for traditional efforts to develop effective vaccines. To investigate the potential of a multi-epitope vaccination strategy to prevent chickens against ALV-J infections, a recombinant chimeric multi-epitope protein X (rCMEPX) containing both immunodominant B and T epitope concentrated domains selected from the major structural protein of ALV-J using bioinformatics approach was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3). Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy was studied in chickens. The results showed that rCMEPX could elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses, and antibodies induced by rCMEPX could specifically recognize host cell naturally expressed ALV-J proteins, which indicated that the rCMEPX is a good immunogen. Challenge experiments showed 80% chickens that received rCMEPX were well protected against ALV-J challenge. This is the first report of a chimeric multi-epitope protein as a potential immunogen against ALV-J.","Xu, Qingqing; Ma, Xingjiang; Wang, Fangkun; Li, Hongmei; Zhao, Xiaomin",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196055/,569

Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of the p110α isoform of PI3K induces similar enhancement of mitochondrial function in middle-aged mice. Eight-month old male and female mice were fed a diet containing 0.3 g/kg of the p110α-selective inhibitor BYL-719 (BYL) or a vehicle diet (VEH) for six weeks. Mice consuming BYL-719 had higher fed blood glucose and insulin, and tended towards decreased body weight. After 72 h, gene expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis mediators Pgc1α, Tfam and Nrf1 was greater in liver of BYL-719 males only, but unchanged in skeletal muscle of either sex. Six weeks of BYL-719 treatment did not affect mitochondrial content or function in the liver or skeletal muscle of either sex. In livers of males only, the expression of the antioxidant genes Nfe2l2, Cat, Sod1 and Sod2 increased within 72 h of BYL-719 treatment, and remained higher after six weeks. This was associated with an increase in hepatic GSH content and catalase protein expression, and lower H2O2 levels. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of p110α in adult mice does not affect liver or skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, but does show sex- and tissue-specific effects on upregulation of antioxidant response. Given BYL-719 was well-tolerated and improved oxidative balance, it may have potential to influence aging-associated metabolic decline in the long-term.","Hedges, Christopher; Pham, Toan; Shetty, Bhoopika; Masson, Stewart W C; Hickey, Anthony; Shepherd, Peter R; Merry, Troy L",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20201128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006363/,569

105195,Global financial crisis and surgical practice: the Greek paradigm.,2011,"Norovirus is one of the most common causes of acute viral gastroenteritis. The virus is spread via the fecal-oral route, most commonly from infected food and water, but several outbreaks have originated from contamination of surfaces with infectious virus. In this study, a close surrogate of human norovirus causing gastrointestinal disease in mice, murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1), retained infectivity for more than 2 weeks following contact with a range of surface materials, including Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. Persistence was slightly prolonged on ceramic surfaces. A previous study in our laboratory observed that dry copper and copper alloy surfaces rapidly inactivated MNV-1 and destroyed the viral genome. In this new study, we have observed that a relatively small change in the percentage of copper, between 70 and 80% in copper nickels and 60 and 70% in brasses, had a significant influence on the ability of the alloy to inactivate norovirus. Nickel alone did not affect virus, but zinc did have some antiviral effect, which was synergistic with copper and resulted in an increased efficacy of brasses with lower percentages of copper. Electron microscopy of purified MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and stainless steel surfaces suggested that a massive breakdown of the viral capsid had occurred on copper. In addition, MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and treated with RNase demonstrated a reduction in viral gene copy number. This suggests that capsid integrity is compromised upon contact with copper, allowing copper ion access to the viral genome.","Warnes, Sarah L; Summersgill, Emma N; Keevil, C William",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.03280-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25452290/,569
105223,"Modelling the impact of testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on second waves of COVID-19.",2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are commonly used to provide feedback to students on their performance in formative examinations. However, students are often unable to act independently on the feedback they receive. This study explored how the use of video-assisted reflection in OSCEs can enhance students' ability to reflect and engage in sustainable feedback. METHODS Twenty-one students undertaking a mock-final OSCE consented to have one of their examination stations filmed. Participants completed a series of reflective forms immediately after the OSCE, after verbal feedback from an examiner and finally, after watching the video of their own performance. Students were asked to predict their overall grade as well as list areas for improvement. Pearson r correlations examined the relationship between the examiners' grades and the candidates' self-predicted grades. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the length of reflections at each stage. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore students' beliefs on self-efficacy and how the video-assisted reflection altered their ability to act on feedback. RESULTS The students' ability to self-assess and gauge their own performance improved significantly after undertaking the video-assisted reflection (p < 0.01). Furthermore, video-assisted reflection significantly increased the length of the student's reflections. In interviews, participants described multiple ways in which the video-assisted reflection improved their confidence and ability to act on feedback, highlighting a clear enhancement in self-efficacy. DISCUSSION Video-assisted reflection of recorded OSCE stations represents an effective approach to increase student self-efficacy and subsequently improve engagement in sustainable feedback practice.","Mitchell, Oliver; Cotton, Natalia; Leedham-Green, Kathleen; Elias, Salem; Bartholomew, Brent",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939280/,569
106793,Virtual Cardiology-Views From a Muted Microphone.,2020-07-22,"OBJECTIVE Visual scoring of 30-s epochs of sleep data is not always adequate to show the dynamic structure of sleep in sufficient details. It is also prone to considerable inter- and intra-rater variability. Moreover, it involves considerable training and experience, and is very tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Hence, automatic sleep staging is needed to overcome these limitations. Since naturally occurring NREM sleep and anesthesia have been reported to possess various underlying neurophysiological similarities, EEG-based depth-of-anesthesia monitors have started to penetrate into sleep research. This study investigates the ability of WAV(CNS) index (as implemented in NeuroSENSE depth-of-anesthesia monitor) to detect NREM sleep stages and wake state for full overnight PSG data. METHODS Full overnight PSG sleep data, obtained from 24 adolescents, was scored by a registered PSG technologist for different sleep stages. Retrospective analysis was performed on a single frontal channel using the WAV(CNS) algorithm. Non-parametric descriptive statistics were used to examine the relationship between WAV(CNS) index and sleep stages. RESULTS A strong correlation (ρ = 0.9458) was found between the WAV(CNS) index and NREM sleep stages, with WAV(CNS) index values decreasing with increasing sleep stages. Moreover, there was no significant overlap between different NREM sleep stages as classified by the WAV(CNS) index, which was able to significantly differentiate (P < 0.001) between all pairs of Awake and different NREM stages. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that changes in the depth of natural NREM sleep are reflected sensitively by changes in the WAV(CNS) index. Hence, WAV(CNS) index may serve as an automatic real-time indicator of depth of natural sleep with high temporal resolution, and can possibly be of great use for automated sleep staging in routine/postoperative somnographic studies.","Agrawal, Gracee; Modarres, Mohammad; Zikov, Tatjana; Bibian, Stephane",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-011-9290-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789744/,569

The purpose of this review is to examine the extant literature on the reliability of ICD codes to correctly identify STIs. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles in which ICD codes were validated with respect to their ability to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Articles that included sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of ICD codes were the target. In addition to keyword searches in PubMed and Scopus databases, we further examined bibliographies of articles selected for full review to maximise yield. RESULTS From a total of 1779 articles identified, only two studies measured the reliability of ICD codes to identify cases of STIs. Both articles targeted PID, a serious complication of chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Neither article directly assessed the validity of ICD codes to identify cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis independent of PID. Using ICD codes alone, the positive predictive value for PID was mixed (range: 18%-79%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION While existing studies have used ICD codes to identify STI cases, their reliability is unclear. Further, available evidence from studies of PID suggests potentially large variation in the accuracy of ICD codes indicating the need for primary studies to evaluate ICD codes for use in STI-related public health research.","Dixon, Brian E; Rahurkar, Saurabh; Ho, Yenling; Arno, Janet N",BMJ health & care informatics,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399425/,569

107720,Naturalistic Lessons in Post-Inauguration Leadership.,2021-03-01,"Background Delirium is common after surgery, although the aetiology is poorly defined. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin important in neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. Decreased levels of BDNF have been associated with poor cognitive outcomes, but few studies have characterized the role of BDNF perioperatively. We hypothesized that intraoperative decreases in BDNF levels are associated with postoperative delirium. Methods Patients undergoing spine surgery were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Plasma BDNF was collected at baseline and at least hourly intraoperatively. Delirium was assessed using rigorous methods, including the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM for the intensive care unit. Associations of changes in BDNF and delirium were examined using regression models. Results Postoperative delirium developed in 32 of 77 (42%) patients. The median baseline BDNF level was 7.6 ng ml -1 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.0-11.2] and generally declined intraoperatively [median decline 61% (IQR 31-80)]. There was no difference in baseline BDNF levels by delirium status. However, the percent decline in BDNF was greater in patients who developed delirium [median 74% (IQR 51-82)] vs in those who did not develop delirium [median 50% (IQR 14-79); P =0.03]. Each 1% decline in BDNF was associated with increased odds of delirium in unadjusted {odds ratio [OR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.04]; P =0.01}, multivariable-adjusted [OR 1.02 (95% CI 1.00-1.03); P =0.03], and propensity score-adjusted models [OR 1.02 (95% CI 1.00-1.04); P =0.03].

108926,Reproductive technology and social justice: a view from Brazil.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVES To calculate imposed work of breathing during simulated spontaneous breathing at a given tidal volume across the range of normal length or shortened pediatric endotracheal tube sizes and endotracheal tubes with an intraluminal catheter in situ. DESIGN In vitro study. SETTING Research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS A bench model (normal compliance, no airway resistance) simulating sinusoid flow spontaneous breathing used to calculate imposed work of breathing for various endotracheal tube sizes (3.0-7.5 mm). Imposed work of breathing was calculated by integrating inspiratory tidal volume over the end-expiratory difference between the positive end-expiratory pressure and the tracheal pressure. Measurements were taken at different combinations of set spontaneous tidal volume (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mL/kg), age-appropriate inspiratory times, length of endotracheal tube, and presence of intraluminal catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Overall median imposed work of breathing (Joules/L) was not significantly different between the four age groups: 0.047 Joules/L (interquartile range, 0.020-0.074 Joules/L) for newborns, 0.077 Joules/L (interquartile range, 0.032-0.127 Joules/L) for infants, 0.109 Joules/L (interquartile range, 0.0399-0.193 Joules/L) for small children, and 0.077 Joules/L (interquartile range, 0.032-0.132 Joules/L) for adolescents. Shortening the endotracheal tubes resulted in a significant difference in reduction in overall imposed work of breathing, but the absolute reduction was most notable in small children (0.030 Joules/L) and the least effect in neonates (0.016 Joules/L). Overall imposed work of breathing increased in each age group when an intraluminal catheter was in situ: 91.09% increase in imposed work of breathing in neonates to 0.168 Joules/L, 84.98% in infants to 0.142 Joules/L, 81.98% in small children to 0.219 Joules/L, and 55.45% in adolescents to 0.140 Joules/L. CONCLUSIONS Calculated imposed work of breathing were not different across the range of endotracheal tube sizes. The low imposed work of breathing values found in this study might be appreciated as clinically irrelevant. Our findings add to the change in reasoning that it is appropriate to perform spontaneous breathing trials without pressure support. Nonetheless, our findings on the measured imposed work of breathing values need to be confirmed in a clinical study.","van Dijk, Jefta; Blokpoel, Robert G T; Koopman, Alette A; Brandsema, Ruben; Newth, Christopher J L; Kneyber, Martin C J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427436/,569

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 85 patients (mean age, 3.5 +/- 2.35 months), clinically diagnosed as first-episode acute bronchiolitis in addition to 10 healthy controls of matched age and sex. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either montelukast (4-mg sachets; n = 47) or placebo (n = 38) daily from the time of admission until discharge. The primary outcome measure was the length of hospital stay (LOS), and clinical severity scores (CSs) and changes in plasma levels of interferon gamma and interleukin-4 were secondary outcomes. LOS for the montelukast group was found to be significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p < 0.05). This effect was also found at nonsignificant levels among patients with a positive family history of asthma or allergy. Moreover, cases receiving montelukast showed lower CSs all through the hospital stay that were significant in the first 24 hours (p < 0.05). Montelukast is probably of benefit as an episodic modifier in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis.","Zedan, Magdy; Gamil, Nareman; El-Assmy, Mohamed; Fayez, Engy; Nasef, Nehad; Fouda, Ashraf; Settin, Ahmed",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2010.31.3324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20406596/,569

OBJECTIVES This article presents the results of a systematic literature review examining the impact of the Health Information Management (HIM) profession on patient safety. METHODS A PRISMA approach was adopted for the review of selected databases and specific journals. Titles identified as relating to HIM and patient quality were screened using Covidence ® by title and abstract, followed by full text. The quality of selected articles was assessed and thematically analysed. RESULTS Analysis of the 8 included articles found that the key themes from the non-empirical research were data quality, information governance, corporate governance, skills and knowledge required for HIM professionals. DISCUSSION Most publications focussed on HIM professional involvement in maintaining standards for data quality and health records, but not the professional qualifications themselves. CONCLUSIONS There are links between patient safety and health records, and between health records and HIM professional work.

119760,Remote Cardiac Safety Monitoring through the Lens of the FDA Biomarker Qualification Evidentiary Criteria Framework: A Case Study Analysis.,2021,"BACKGROUND Neuroendovascular intervention has become a key treatment option for acute ischemic stroke. The Sofia (6F) PLUS catheter was designed for neurovascular access for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE To report the first series describing use of the Sofia PLUS intermediate/distal access reperfusion catheter in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS In this retrospective study, 41 stroke cases were identified in which the catheter was utilized for thrombolysis/thrombectomy. Mean preprocedure National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16.5 ± 5.2 (range 4-29). Occluded vessels included the M1 segment, M2 segment, internal carotid artery terminus, cervical internal carotid artery, and basilar artery. RESULTS Successful positioning of the Sofia PLUS catheter near the occlusion site was achieved in 38 (92.7%) of 41 cases in which thrombectomy or thrombolysis was attempted using intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator, a direct aspiration first-pass technique, and/or stent retrieval. A postprocedure thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 2b/3 was achieved in 37 of 41 cases. Of 15 cases where the Sofia PLUS was used for a direct aspiration first-pass technique, TICI 2b/3 was achieved in 11 (73.3%). In one case where intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator was used as the only treatment modality, TICI 2a was achieved. No device-related or catheter-related complications were observed. The mean 7-d-postprocedure National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score among the 39 survivors was 8.5 ± 7.3 (range 0-23). CONCLUSION Initial results with use of the Sofia (6F) PLUS for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been encouraging.

121599,"Staff burnout: MPs demand ""total overhaul"" of NHS workforce planning.",2021-06-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Devices using the electroencephalogram to estimate anesthetic depth have been available since 1996. Despite the use of these monitors for over a decade, there is little agreement among clinicians about the need for or value of depth of anesthesia monitoring. Since the majority of the studies evaluating the impact of depth of anesthesia monitoring on postoperative outcomes have utilized the bispectral index (BIS Covidian), this manuscript will focus on studies with this device. This review will evaluate the evidence that BIS monitoring can improve long-term outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce the incidence of awareness with recall in high-risk patients, but a recent study found that anesthetic management directed by an end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration protocol is equally effective, and probably less expensive. Deep anesthesia (BIS < 45) during the intraoperative period is associated with increased postoperative mortality, but this relationship may be an epiphenomenon rather than causal. SUMMARY There is growing concern that anesthetic management and even specific anesthetic agents may worsen outcomes in high-risk patients. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that depth of anesthesia monitors can improve outcomes and no evidenced-based reasons for anesthesia providers to change their current practice.","Monk, Terri G; Weldon, B Craig",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0b013e32834c7acf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21971395/,569
122303,Novel 3D segmentation for reliable volumetric assessment of the nasal airway: a CBCT study.,2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have shown promise in improving the outcomes for patients with peripheral artery disease. We compared a paclitaxel-coated balloon with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of symptomatic superficial femoral and popliteal artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The IN.PACT SFA Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized trial in which 331 patients with intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to superficial femoral and popliteal peripheral artery disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The primary efficacy end point was primary patency, defined as freedom from restenosis or clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean lesion length and the percentage of total occlusions for the DCB and PTA arms were 8.94 ± 4.89 and 8.81 ± 5.12 cm (P=0.82) and 25.8% and 19.5% (P=0.22), respectively. DCB resulted in higher primary patency versus PTA (82.2% versus 52.4%; P<0.001). The rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 2.4% in the DCB arm in comparison with 20.6% in the PTA arm (P<0.001). There was a low rate of vessel thrombosis in both arms (1.4% after DCB and 3.7% after PTA [P=0.10]). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial, DCB was superior to PTA and had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease.

The vagal nerve (VN) can easily be detected, preserved, and intentionally resected below the separation point of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). However, postoperative vocal cord paresis can result from vagal or RLN injury during radical lymph node dissection, presenting a challenge to the operating surgeon. METHODS From May to August 2019, 10 cases of robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) with extended 2-field lymphadenectomy, performed at the University Medical Center Mainz, were included in a prospective cohort study. Bilateral intermittent intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) of the RLN and VN was performed, including pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy assessment. RESULTS Reliable mean signals of the right VN (2.57 mV/4.50 ms) and the RLN (left 1.24 mV/3.71 ms, right 0.85 mV/3.56 ms) were obtained. IONM facilitated the identification of the exact height of separation of the right RLN from the VN. There were no cases of permanent postoperative vocal paresis. Median lymph node count from the paratracheal stations was 5 lymph nodes. CONCLUSION IONM was feasible during RAMIE. The intraoperative identification of the RLN location contributed to the accuracy of lymph node dissection of the paratracheal lymph node stations. RLN damage and subsequent postoperative vocal cord paresis can potentially be prevented by IONM.","Staubitz, J I; van der Sluis, P C; Berlth, F; Watzka, F; Dette, F; Läßig, A; Lang, H; Musholt, T J; Grimminger, P P",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-01990-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970189/,569

Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of carvedilol for primary or secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and gray literature sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carvedilol with placebo or any active intervention. We synthesized data using random effects models. We summarized the strength of evidence using GRADE criteria. Results We included 13 trials with 1598 patients. Carvedilol was as efficacious as endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) (4 RCTs, risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.49) or propranolol (3 RCTs, RR 0.76, 95%CI 0.27-2.14) for primary prevention of variceal bleeding. Likewise, carvedilol was as efficacious as EVL (3 RCTs, RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.75-1.61), non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate (2 RCTs, RR 1.02, 95%CI 0.70-1.51) or propranolol (2 RCTs, RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.15-1.03) for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. Carvedilol was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared to EVL (3 RCTs, RR 0.51, 95%CI 0.33-0.79). There was no difference in any other efficacy outcome. Finally, there were no significant differences in the safety profiles compared with EVL and NSBBs. Our confidence in the effect estimates for all outcomes was very low. Conclusion Carvedilol is as efficacious and safe as standard-of-care interventions for the primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.","Malandris, Konstantinos; Paschos, Paschalis; Katsoula, Anastasia; Manolopoulos, Apostolos; Andreadis, Panagiotis; Sarigianni, Maria; Athanasiadou, Eleni; Akriviadis, Evangelos; Tsapas, Apostolos",Annals of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2019.0368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040627/,569

The purpose of the study was to investigate the occurrence of 16S rRNA methyltransferase (RMTase) genes in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) clinical isolates associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in China. Methods From July 2015 to December 2018, a total of 137 unique CRKP clinical isolates associated with BSIs were collected from 11 Chinese teaching hospitals. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify 16S RMTase genes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all CRKP clinical isolates. Relevant information was extracted from WGS data (antibiotic resistance determinants, K-type and wzi allelic types). All 16S RMTase-producing CRKP clinical isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results In this study, 137 CRKPs were found to harbor at least one carbapenemase gene. Among 137 CRKPs, 78 (56.9%, 78/137) were positive for 16S RMTase genes (5 for armA, 70 for rmtB, 3 for both armA and rmtB) and highly resistant to gentamicin and amikacin (MICs ≥256 mg/L). Seventy-five isolates harboring 16S RMTase genes also produced ESBLs. In this study, 5 sequence types (STs) and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 78 isolates positive for 16S RMTases genes, while 14 STs and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 59 isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes. Compared with the isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes, the STs and capsular serotypes of 16S RMTases-positive strains are more concentrated. Among 78 16S RMTases-positive strains, the most prevalent clone type is ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64 (62.8%, 49/78), which mainly carries the rmtB and blaKPC genes and is distributed in 7 provinces in China. Conclusion A high prevalence of 16S RMTase genes was found among CRKP clinical isolates associated with BSIs from Chinese teaching hospitals, which was attributed to the dissemination of the ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64 clone.","Shen, Xiaofei; Liu, Li; Yu, Jingyi; Ai, Wenxiu; Cao, Xingwei; Zhan, Qing; Guo, Yinjuan; Wang, Liangxing; Yu, Fangyou",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s254479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764995/,569

The methodology is that an observational study was undertaken during January and February, 2010. An audit tool was constructed for the recording of information on a variety of parameters relating to the correct fitting and wearing of anti-embolism stockings. The results show that eighty surgical patients were audited with a mean age of 66 years. Of these, 72.5% were ambulatory; 38.75% of patients had incorrect presentation of their stockings; 29% were fitted with the incorrect size for limb measurement and 70% of patients reported not receiving any information regarding the reason for anti-embolism stocking use. Written information was not received by 100% of participants. For 82.5% of participants deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk was not recorded. The garment size fitted (and/or limb measurement) was not recorded for 100% of patients. Daily routine skin inspection was noted for 29%.

130585,"England's clinical negligence system needs urgent reform, say medical organisations.",2021-02-24,"OBJECTIVES Using a radiomics framework to quantitatively analyze tumor shape and texture features in three dimensions, we tested its ability to objectively and robustly distinguish between benign and malignant renal masses. We assessed the relative contributions of shape and texture metrics separately and together in the prediction model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computed tomography (CT) images of 735 patients with 539 malignant and 196 benign masses were segmented in this retrospective study. Thirty-three shape and 760 texture metrics were calculated per tumor. Tumor classification models using shape, texture, and both metrics were built using random forest and AdaBoost with tenfold cross-validation. Sensitivity analyses on five sub-cohorts with respect to the acquisition phase were conducted. Additional sensitivity analyses after multiple imputation were also conducted. Model performance was assessed using AUC. RESULTS Random forest classifier showed shape metrics featuring within the top 10% performing metrics regardless of phase, attaining the highest variable importance in the corticomedullary phase. Convex hull perimeter ratio is a consistently high-performing shape feature. Shape metrics alone achieved an AUC ranging 0.64-0.68 across multiple classifiers, compared with 0.67-0.75 and 0.68-0.75 achieved by texture-only and combined models, respectively. CONCLUSION Shape metrics alone attain high prediction performance and high variable importance in the combined model, while being independent of the acquisition phase (unlike texture). Shape analysis therefore should not be overlooked in its potential to distinguish benign from malignant tumors, and future radiomics platforms powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics. KEY POINTS • Current radiomics research is heavily weighted towards texture analysis, but quantitative shape metrics should not be ignored in their potential to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumors. • Shape metrics alone can attain high prediction performance and demonstrate high variable importance in the combined shape and texture radiomics model. • Any future radiomics platform powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics, especially since tumor shape (unlike texture) is independent of the acquisition phase and more robust from the imaging variations.","Yap, Felix Y; Varghese, Bino A; Cen, Steven Y; Hwang, Darryl H; Lei, Xiaomeng; Desai, Bhushan; Lau, Christopher; Yang, Lindsay L; Fullenkamp, Austin J; Hajian, Simin; Rivas, Marielena; Gupta, Megha Nayyar; Quinn, Brian D; Aron, Manju; Desai, Mihir M; Aron, Monish; Oberai, Assad A; Gill, Inderbir S; Duddalwar, Vinay A",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07158-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803417/,569

Flat-dosing of several immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab, have been established. Although generally well tolerated with no new safety signals, new dosages can associate novel individual toxicities. As the use of ICIs is increasing in cancer patients, the present case report is a reminder for clinicians of potential novel toxicities, as well as the need for an interdisciplinary approach for their recognition and treatment. We report the occurrence of a severe neurologic toxicity in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed should be changed to which occurred after two doses of extended higher interval flat-dose nivolumab despite two years of clinical stability on prior nivolumab regimen. Patient developed fever, language impairment and altered mental status. The work-up tests excluded other potential causes and the most likely diagnosis was meningoencephalitis. Fortunately, with medical treatment, which consisted of high dose steroids, the patient recovered to his baseline situation and symptoms did not recurred, even though nivolumab was resumed.

131515,Favorable Outcomes From an In-person and Online Feasibility Mindful Moment Pilot Study.,2021,"BACKGROUND COVID19 is caused by a newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) that affects pregnant women equally to the general population. How SARS-CoV2 affects the mothers, the neonates and the placental pathology remain controversial. OBJECTIVE To explore the effects of maternal SARS-CoV2 infection on the neonates and placental pathology in comparison to those from the normal pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN Maternal, neonatal and placental pathology data were collected from medical records between March and August 2020 from New York Presbyterian- Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. The data from a total 142 neonates and 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers were compared with those from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers. RESULTS There were 142 SARS-CoV2 positive mothers within the study group, and 43 (36%) of them showed various degrees of COVID19 related clinical symptoms including fever (13.8%), cough (5.7%), loss of taste/smell (anosmia)(5.6%), shortness of breath (2.4%), muscle ache (2.4%), headache (1.6%) and pneumonia (0.8%). A total 142 neonates were born to the SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, and only 1 neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV2 in the first 24 h. Two additional neonates were initially tested negative in first 24 h, and later tested positive on day 7 and the 1 month visit, and all these neonates were asymptomatic and had no sequelae. There was no increase of pre-term labor and delivery or NICU admissions from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Examination of 101 placentas from SARS-CoV2 positive mothers and 121 placentas from SARS-CoV2 negative mothers revealed no increase of placental pathologic features. There were more vaginal deliveries and more meconium stain of fetal membranes from the SARS-CoV2 positive mothers. Previous reports of more maternal vascular malperfusion and fetal vascular malperfusion were not demonstrated in our current data. CONCLUSION Although SARS-CoV2 is a significant risk to the pregnant women (mothers) and general population, there is no increased risk for neonates.

We present the results of a large prospective study on the use of the Solitaire Flow Restoration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization was an international, multicenter, prospective, single-arm study of Solitaire Flow Restoration thrombectomy in patients with large vessel anterior circulation strokes treated within 8 hours of symptom onset. Strict criteria for site selection were applied. The primary end point was the revascularization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2b) of the occluded vessel as determined by an independent core laboratory. The secondary end point was the rate of good functional outcome (defined as 90-day modified Rankin scale, 0-2). RESULTS A total of 202 patients were enrolled across 14 comprehensive stroke centers in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The median age was 72 years, 60% were female patients. The median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was 17. Most proximal intracranial occlusion was the internal carotid artery in 18%, and the middle cerebral artery in 82%. Successful revascularization was achieved in 79.2% of patients. Device and procedure-related severe adverse events were found in 7.4%. Favorable neurological outcome was found in 57.9%. The mortality rate was 6.9%. Any intracranial hemorrhagic transformation was found in 18.8% of patients, 1.5% were symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS In this single-arm study, treatment with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device in intracranial anterior circulation occlusions results in high rates of revascularization, low risk of clinically relevant procedural complications, and good clinical outcomes in combination with low mortality at 90 days.

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective chart review. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all cochlear implant recipients complaining of pain around their RS through the years 2009 through 2013, with a follow-up of at least 6 months. Excluded from the study were patients with an identifiable cause for their pain such as trauma, local infection, or skin breakdown. The therapy regimen and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Thirty patients complained of delayed pain over their RS, representing 2.8% of 1,044 implantations performed at the Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, as of 2013. The time from implantation to the presentation of pain ranged from 3 months to 12 years. The pain was perceptible even when the external magnet and processor were not used, and was usually most obvious in specific points around the RS. Seventy-seven percent of our patients responded well to conservative therapy. Fifteen (50%) responded to prolonged antibiotic treatment. Five patients (17%) responded to antiinflammatories alone. One patient (3%) responded to deactivation of two electrodes. Six patients (20%) required reimplantation, after which the pain resolved in all. At explantation, no signs of infection, foreign body reaction, or obvious device damage were found. CONCLUSION Delayed pain around the RS that is unrelated to use is a serious consequence of cochlear implantation, and in some cases, those necessitating reimplantation, should be considered a major complication.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of 5 women (age range, 45-55years) with stage I vaginal carcinoma who underwent surgery at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, between January 4, 2009, and December 30, 2011. All participants had lesions in the upper third of the vagina and wished to retain sexual function. Patients underwent radical hysterectomy and vaginectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, followed by sigmoid vaginoplasty for vaginal reconstruction. RESULTS The mean operative time was 248.0±39.6minutes and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 335.0±76.6mL. All patients recovered well after surgery and no delayed complications or recurrence were experienced during a mean follow-up of 22.8±9.98months. None of the patients developed vaginal stenosis and all were satisfied with their postoperative sexuality. The mean Female Sexual Function Index was 28.0±1.92.

Predictive markers are urgently needed, since only a minority of patients benefits from ICB, while serious adverse effects of immunotoxicity may occur. The study cohort included 43 ICB-treated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma showing long-term response (n = 16), rapid progression (n = 21) or intermediate patterns of response (n = 6). Lung biopsies acquired before initiation of ICB were analyzed by targeted mRNA expression profiling of 770 genes. Level and proportions of 14 immune cell types were estimated using characteristic gene expression signatures. Abundance of B cells (HR = 0.66, p = .00074), CD45+ cells (HR = 0.61, p = .01) and total TILs (HR = 0.62, p = .025) was associated with prolonged progression-free survival after ICB treatment. In a ROC analysis, B cells (AUC = 0.77, p = .0055) and CD45+ cells (AUC = 0.73, p = .019) predicted benefit of ICB, which was not the case for PD-L1 mRNA (AUC = 0.54, p = .72) and PD-L1 protein expression (AUC = 0.68, p = .082). Clustering of 79 candidate predictive markers identified among 770 investigated genes revealed two distinct predictive clusters which included cytotoxic cell or macrophage markers, respectively. In summary, targeted gene expression profiling was feasible using routine diagnostics biopsies. This study proposes B cells and total TILs as complementary predictors of ICB benefit in NSCLC. While further preferably prospective validation is required, gene expression profiling could be integrated in the routine diagnostic work-up complementing existing NGS protocols.","Budczies, Jan; Kirchner, Martina; Kluck, Klaus; Kazdal, Daniel; Glade, Julia; Allgäuer, Michael; Kriegsmann, Mark; Heußel, Claus-Peter; Herth, Felix J; Winter, Hauke; Meister, Michael; Muley, Thomas; Fröhling, Stefan; Peters, Solange; Seliger, Barbara; Schirmacher, Peter; Thomas, Michael; Christopoulos, Petros; Stenzinger, Albrecht",Oncoimmunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2020.1860586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520406/,569
135306,Implementing a Mentorship Program for New Nurses During a Pandemic.,2021-02-05,"INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly present in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). These patients frequently present with more complex coronary artery disease (CAD) and higher risk of peri-procedural and post-procedural adverse events, including bleeding, thrombotic events, and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). This article contains updated knowledge and management of patients with CKD undergoing PCI. Areas covered: In this article, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the association of CKD, complex CAD lesions, and complications of PCI are reviewed and the different risk scores available to assess the occurrence of CI-AKI are detailed. Furthermore, various strategies developed to prevent or reduce the impact of complications of PCI are described. Expert commentary: Patients with CKD have remained a challenge in the field of PCI. Several strategies have been evaluated in the last 20 years, with uneven results. Intravascular expansion therapy remains the cornerstone of CI-AKI prevention although recent studies have emphasized the benefit of guided hydration rather than a one-size-fits-all model. N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate have recently been challenged while pretreatment with high-dose statins may be of interest. Finally, recent studies based on intravascular ultrasound and minimal-to-no-use of contrast media have yielded promising results.","Guedeney, Paul; Sorrentino, Sabato; Vogel, Birgit; Baber, Usman; Claessen, Bimmer E; Mehran, Roxana",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2018.1526082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324814/,569
135396,An institutionally racist lockdown policy.,2020-11-16,"Vaccine-induced high-avidity IgA can protect against bacterial enteropathogens by directly neutralizing virulence factors or by poorly defined mechanisms that physically impede bacterial interactions with the gut tissues ('immune exclusion'). IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high pathogen densities (≥108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections, much lower densities (100-107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities, inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Moor, Kathrin; Diard, Médéric; Sellin, Mikael E; Felmy, Boas; Wotzka, Sandra Y; Toska, Albulena; Bakkeren, Erik; Arnoldini, Markus; Bansept, Florence; Co, Alma Dal; Völler, Tom; Minola, Andrea; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Agatic, Gloria; Barbieri, Sonia; Piccoli, Luca; Casiraghi, Costanza; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Regoes, Roland R; Loverdo, Claude; Stocker, Roman; Brumley, Douglas R; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Slack, Emma",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature22058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405025/,569
137921,"Imaging of Oncologic Treatment-Related Pneumonitis: A Focused Review on Emerging Issues of Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitor Pneumonitis, From the AJR Special Series on Inflammation.",2021-02-17,"OBJECTIVE A standardized guideline for treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in premature infants is still missing. Because an early ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery is avoided due to low body weight and fragility of the patients, the neurosurgical treatment focuses on temporary solutions for CSF diversion as a minimally invasive approach. Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) was additionally introduced for early elimination of intraventricular blood components to reduce possible subsequent complications such as shunt dependency, infection, and multiloculated hydrocephalus. The authors report their first experience regarding neurodevelopmental outcome after NEL in this patient cohort. METHODS In a single-center retrospective cohort study with 45 patients undergoing NEL, the authors measured neurocognitive development at 2 years with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition, Mental Developmental Index (BSID II MDI) and graded the ability to walk with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). They further recorded medication with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and quantified ventricular and brain volumes by using 3D MRI data sets. RESULTS Forty-four patients were alive at 2 years of age. Eight of 27 patients (30%) assessed revealed a fairly normal neurocognitive development (BSID II MDI ≥ 70), 28 of 36 patients (78%) were able to walk independently or with minimal aid (GMFCS 0-2), and 73% did not require AED treatment. Based on MR volume measurements, greater brain volume was positively correlated with BSID II MDI (rs = 0.52, 95% CI 0.08-0.79) and negatively with GMFCS (rs = -0.69, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.42). Based on Bayesian logistic regression, AED treatment, the presence of comorbidities, and also cerebellar pathology could be identified as relevant risk factors for both neurodevelopmental outcomes, increasing the odds more than 2-fold-but with limited precision in estimation. CONCLUSIONS Neuromotor outcome assessment after NEL is comparable to previously published drainage, irrigation, and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) study results. A majority of NEL-treated patients showed independent mobility. Further validation of outcome measurements is warranted in an extended setup, as intended by the prospective international multicenter registry for treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (TROPHY).","Behrens, Philine; Tietze, Anna; Walch, Elisabeth; Bittigau, Petra; Bührer, Christoph; Schulz, Matthias; Aigner, Annette; Thomale, Ulrich-Wilhelm",Journal of neurosurgery.

No study has reported changes in RA emptying over time or evaluated whether serial measurements offer further prognostic information. METHODS Prospective study of 32 children with idiopathic or heritable PAH undergoing echocardiogram at baseline and 1-year. RA conduit fraction percent (RA cF%) was measured as percentage of total diastolic RA area change prior to the electrical p wave. Clinical worsening was analyzed with a predefined composite adverse event outcome. RESULTS Longitudinal subjects (median age 13.3 yr) had RA cF% 61% (IQR 32-68%) at baseline and 60% (IQR 35-73%) at 1-year (NS). 11 subjects had a qualifying event during median 21-month follow-up. Subjects with an event had 1-year RA cF% = 33% (IQR 20-40%) compared to 72% (IQR 63-75%) for those with no event (p < 0.001). Event rates were lowest for subjects with both echocardiograms showing RA cF% > 60% (0%), highest for subjects with neither (80%), and intermediate for those with one (38%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Changes in RA cF% inform risk of adverse events in pediatric PAH.

141122,The problematic place of private payment for healthcare in Australia.,2021-02-24,"INTRODUCTION Assessing quality of healthcare is integral in determining progress towards equitable health outcomes worldwide. Using the WHO 'Standards for improving quality of care for children and young adolescents in health facilities' as a reference standard, we aimed to evaluate existing tools that assess quality of care for children. METHODS We undertook a systematic literature review of publications/reports between 2008 and 2020 that reported use of quality of care assessment tools for children (<15 years) in health facilities. Identified tools were reviewed against the 40 quality statements and 510 quality measures from the WHO Standards to determine the extent each tool was consistent with the WHO Standards. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO ID: CRD42020175652. RESULTS Nine assessment tools met inclusion criteria. Two hospital care tools developed by WHO-Europe and WHO-South-East Asia Offices had the most consistency with the WHO Standards, assessing 291 (57·1%) and 208 (40·8%) of the 510 quality measures, respectively. Remaining tools included between 33 (6·5%) and 206 (40·4%) of the 510 quality measures. The WHO-Europe tool was the only tool to assess all 40 quality statements. The most common quality measures absent were related to experience of care, particularly provision of educational, emotional and psychosocial support to children and families, and fulfilment of children's rights during care. CONCLUSION Quality of care assessment tools for children in health facilities are missing some key elements highlighted by the WHO Standards. The WHO Standards are, however, extensive and applying all the quality measures in every setting may not be feasible. A consensus of key indicators to monitor the WHO Standards is required. Existing tools could be modified to include priority indicators to strengthen progress reporting towards delivering quality health services for children. In doing so, a balance between comprehensiveness and practical utility is needed.

Earlier we reported a down-regulation of several key hepatic lipogenic enzymes and their upstream regulators in liver-specific PDC-deficient mouse (L-PDCKO model by deleting the Pdha1 gene). In this study we investigated gene expression profiles of key glycolytic enzymes and other proteins that respond to various metabolic stresses in liver from L-PDCKO mice. Transcripts of several, such as hexokinase 2, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase muscle-type 2, and lactate dehydrogenase B as well as those for the nonglycolysis-related proteins, CD-36, C/EBP homologous protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, were up-regulated in L-PDCKO liver whereas hypoxia-induced factor-1α, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and Sirtuin 1 transcripts were down-regulated. The protein levels of pyruvate kinase muscle-type 2 and lactate dehydrogenase B were increased whereas that of lactate dehydrogenase A was decreased in PDC-deficient mouse liver. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress indicators suggests that the L-PDCKO liver showed evidence of the former but not the latter. These findings indicate that (i) liver-specific PDC deficiency is sufficient to induce ""aerobic glycolysis characteristic"" in mouse liver, and (ii) the mechanism(s) responsible for these changes appears distinct from that which induces the Warburg effect in some cancer cells.","Patel, Mulchand S; Mahmood, Saleh; Jung, Jiwon; Rideout, Todd C",Physiological reports,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400855/,569

Exposure among first responders remains unknown. METHODS Rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among first responders in Arizona were determined, and attitudes / views about the impact of COVID-19 on their work life was analyzed. RESULTS Of 3,326 first responders, 50 (1.50%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Most first responders thought antibody testing would help ease their anxieties (62.5%) and be beneficial to their work-life (60.6%). CONCLUSION The rate of COVID-19 exposure among first responders in Arizona is low - 1.50%. COVID-19 is a concern among many of the first responders, and antibody testing was beneficial in easing their anxieties about going to work and performing work-related duties.","Shukla, Vershalee; Lau, Christine S M; Towns, Mikayla; Mayer, Jennifer; Kalkbrenner, Kara; Beuerlein, Steve; Prichard, Pablo",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jom.0000000000002027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956235/,569
150956,Perspectives on xenophobia during epidemics and implications for emergency management.,2020,"BACKGROUND Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) is preferred over open gastrectomy because it allows safe anastomosis, a small wound, and early bowel recovery. However, esophagojejunostomy (EJS) following laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) remains technically challenging. To popularize LTG, a secure method of reconstruction must be developed. We present a simple and safe technique for intracorporeal EJS following LTG. METHODS Our modified technique for intracorporeal EJS as a part of Roux-en-Y reconstruction following LTG incorporates an isoperistaltic stapled EJS with closure of the entry hole using two unidirectional barbed sutures. First, a side-to-side isoperistaltic EJS is created between the dorsal and left side of the esophagus and the jejunal arm. Second, the opening for the stapler is closed with a two-layer continuous suture using two 15-cm 3-0 V-Loc suture devices. The full-thickness inner layer closure commences from the sides of the staple lines and progresses toward the center of the enterotomy. During suturing, the remaining thread is utilized to apply tension and lift the enterotomy. Once the full-thickness layer closure is complete at the center of the enterotomy, suturing of the second seromuscular layer is started in the forward direction toward each corner to give a crossover-shaped suturing line. RESULTS From February 2012 to October 2017, 27 patients with gastric cancer underwent LTG with intracorporeal stapled EJS as a part of Roux-en-Y reconstruction. All procedures were successfully performed without any intra- or postoperative anastomosis-related complications. No conversion to other procedures was required. The mean suturing time was 19.1 ± 9.5 min. The mean postoperative time to tolerating a liquid diet was 3.3 days, and the mean hospital stay was 12.1 days. CONCLUSIONS We herein report our procedure for intracorporeal EJS using a linear stapler and barbed sutures. This technique is simple and feasible and has acceptable morbidity.","Lee, Sang-Woong; Kawai, Masaru; Tashiro, Keitaro; Kawashima, Satoshi; Tanaka, Ryo; Tanaka, Keitaro; Nomura, Eiji; Uchiyama, Kazuhisa",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6413-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30187203/,569
152461,SAFER brief community intervention: a primary suicide prevention strategy to improve firearm and medication storage behaviour.,2020-10-19,"BACKGROUND Lung sealants are often used to prevent alveolar air leaks after lung resection surgery. Some sealants have shown to be effective in clinical studies, but extensive comparative evaluation has not yet been conducted. We aimed to evaluate different sealant burst pressures in an ex vivo model mimicking air leakage after lung resection. METHODS Fifty-four porcine lungs comprised the study material. Six different sealants were evaluated: Bioglue (V-Tech, Roskilde, Denmark), TachoSil (Nycomed, Roskilde, Denmark), Tisseel (Baxter, Allerød, Denmark), Evicel (OMRIX biopharmaceuticals S.A, Rhode-St-Genèse, Belgium), TissuePatchDural (Vingmed, Roskilde, Denmark), and Pleuraseal (Covidien, Copenhagen, Denmark). After creating a standardized pleural defect, each lung was randomized into 1 of the 6 treatment groups (n= 9). Each lung was ventilated with incremental airway pressure. Air leakage was assessed after each increment. If leakage occurred, the burst pressure was recorded. RESULTS The Evicel fibrin sealant and Tisseel fibrin sealant exhibited significantly lower burst pressures compared with the Bioglue, TachoSil, and Pleuraseal (p < 0.05). Bioglue had the highest median burst pressure (55 cm H(2)O) followed by TachoSil (35 cm H(2)O), PleuraSeal (35 cm H(2)O), TissuePatchDural (25 cm H(2)O), Evicel (15 cm H(2)O), and Tisseel (15 cm H(2)O). CONCLUSIONS This model has shown to be feasible in determining and comparing the burst pressures of different lung sealants.

154299,Supporting your team during a global pandemic.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is associated with high morbidity and mortality. NOTES tumor enucleation may provide an alternative to laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of NOTES tumor creation and enucleation as a multidisciplinary approach. METHODS A linear-array endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) endoscope was used to inject a thermosensitive ABA triblock polymer mixed with methylene blue through the stomach wall and into the distal pancreas using a 22-gauge EUS needle. Due to its thermosensitive character, the polymer solidifies in response to body temperature, creating an artificial tumor. Seventeen swine underwent NOTES transgastric pancreatic tumor enucleation. Nine nonsurvival animals were sacrificed immediately after the NOTES procedure, with subsequent necropsy. Eight survival animals were observed for up to 16 days after the procedure, subsequently sacrificed, followed by necropsy. RESULTS The procedure was performed successfully in all 17 pigs studied, 9/9 nonsurvival (100%) and 8/8 survival (100%) animals, using a pure NOTES approach without any laparoscopic ports. Complications included two esophageal dissections (1 in nonsurvival group, 1 in survival group) caused by the introduction of the endoscopic overtube (2/17, 12%), unrelated to the actual surgical procedure. In the survival animals, there were two small splenic lacerations caused during retraction with the endoscopic forceps, for which hemostasis was achieved prior to closure of the gastrotomy (2/7, 29%). At necropsy of the animals, there was sufficient closure of 15/17 gastrotomy sites (88%). CONCLUSIONS The creation of artificial pancreatic tumors via EUS guidance is feasible. Pancreatic tumor enucleation using a transgastric NOTES approach is technically feasible and could be an alternative to laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with further development. Further adoption and adaptation of this technique will require the development of more sophisticated specialized tools to improve the safety profile of the procedure.","Matthes, Kai; Thakkar, Shyam J; Lee, Suck-Ho; Gromski, Mark A; Lim, Robert B; Janschek, Johannes; Jones, Stephanie B; Jones, Daniel B; Chuttani, Ram",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1686-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21487862/,569

MATERIALS AND METHODS The HIV-1 integrase gene region was selected because it was a conserved part of the HIV-1 genome. Six primers specific to eight regions of the HIV-1 integrase gene were designed. A total of 171 samples (18 HIV-1 confirmed positive samples and 153 serum specimens were collected in this study) were tested by RT-LAMP and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After amplification in an isothermal water bath for 45 min, samples containing HIV-1 generated the expected ladder-like products while other viruses generated no product. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay were evaluated by comparison with RT-PCR. The assay was significantly more sensitive than normal gel-based RT-PCR. CONCLUSION Because it is specific and simple, the RT-LAMP assay can be widely applied in clinical laboratories for rapid detection of HIV-1.","Zhao, Xihong; Chen, Xiaoping; Zhang, Youhong; He, Xiaowei; Li, Wenmei; Shi, Lei; Chen, Xingzhou; Xu, Zhenbo; Zhong, Nanjing; Ji, Guiyuan; Yang, Liansheng; Wang, Jihua",Indian journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/0255-0857.103757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23183461/,569
156602,The link between maternal obesity and offspring neurobehavior: A systematic review of animal experiments.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Despite the important benefits of a bibliometric approach on mapping a research field, relatively little efforts have previously been conducted to map and analyse the global trends of palliative care (PC)-related research. This bibliometric review aimed to provide an overall picture and systematic mapping of the state of research trends within the field of PC internationally. METHODS Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched to retrieve original articles focusing on PC between 2002 and 2020. Searching was conducted on 5 May 2020, and was updated on 6 May 2021. All retrieved articles were assessed by title and abstract, and the bibliometric metadata of those that met the inclusion criteria were downloaded for analysis. The results were analysed by VOSviewer and Gephi software. RESULTS A total of 19,199 articles met the inclusion criteria. Significant growth of the number of published articles was reported by around five-fold from 2002 to 2020. The USA and UK were the most productive countries in terms of the number of papers published and citations. Weak collaborations were observed between low-income or middle-income countries and high-income countries. Cancer-related PC research was the most common focus. Seven clusters of research were identified and included heart failure and cancer prognosis, nursing home, pain and symptoms management, PC knowledge and attitudes, quality improvement of services, PC ethics, and the ongoing assessment of PC services. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to expand PC-related research to non-cancer diseases. More international research and cross-institutional cooperation is required to address more global PC issues and benefit from wider sharing of expertees, potentially leading to higher quality or more impactful studies. Setting up research agendas and priorities from funding bodies and institutions may also enhance cooperation among researchers.","Abu-Odah, Hammoda; Molassiotis, Alex; Liu, Justina Yat Wa",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-002982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373283/,569
157594,Liver status and outcomes in patients without previous known liver disease receiving anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism.,2021-10-09,"BACKGROUND Although coil embolization is known to prevent rebleeding from acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms, the underlying biological and mechanical mechanisms have not been characterized. We sought to determine if microcoil-dependent interactions with thrombus induce structural and mechanical changes in the adjacent fibrin network. Such changes could play an important role in the prevention of aneurysm rebleeding. METHODS The stiffness of in vitro human blood clots and coil-clot complexes implanted into aneurysm phantoms were measured immediately after formation and after retraction for 3 days using unconfined uniaxial compression assays. Scanning electron microscopy of the coil-clot complexes showed the effect of coiling on clot structure. RESULTS The coil packing densities achieved were in the range of clinical practice. Bare platinum coils increased clot stiffness relative to clot alone (Young's modulus 6.9 kPa and 0.83 kPa, respectively) but did not affect fibrin structure. Hydrogel-coated coils prevented formation of a clot and had no significant effect on clot stiffness (Young's modulus 2 kPa) relative to clot alone. Clot age decreased fiber density by 0.2 fibers/µm(2) but not the stiffness of the bare platinum coil-clot complex. CONCLUSIONS The stiffness of coil-clot complexes is related to the summative stiffness of the fibrin network and associated microcoils. Hydrogel-coated coils exhibit significantly less stiffness due to the mechanical properties of the hydrogel and the inhibition of fibrin network formation by the hydrogel. These findings have important implications for the design and engineering of aneurysm occlusion devices.","Haworth, Kevin J; Weidner, Christopher R; Abruzzo, Todd A; Shearn, Jason T; Holland, Christy K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668257/,569

METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed, including patients with VM of the head and neck who were treated with PS. Only patients with available pre- and post-interventional MRI were included into this study. Clinical outcome, which was subjectively assessed by the patients, their parents (for paediatric patients) and/or the physicians, was categorized as worse, unchanged, minor or major improvement. Radiological outcome, determined by MRI-based volumetric measurements, was categorized as worse (>10% increase), unchanged (≤10% increase to <10% decrease), minor (≥10% to <25% decrease), intermediate (≥25% to <50% decrease) or major improvement (≥50% decrease). RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were treated in 51 treatment sessions. After a mean follow-up of 31 months, clinical outcome was worse for 7.4%, unchanged for 3.7% of the patients, while there was minor and major improvement for 7.4% and 81.5%, respectively. In the volumetric imaging analysis 7.4% of the VMs were worse and 14.8% were unchanged. Minor improvement was observed in 22.2%, intermediate improvement in 44.4% and major improvement in 11.1%. The rate of permanent complications was 3.7%. CONCLUSION PS can be an effective therapy to treat the symptoms of patients with VMs of the head and neck and to downsize the VMs. MRI-based volumetry can be used to objectively follow the change in size of the VMs after PS. Relief of symptoms frequently does not require substantial volume reduction.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Gebhart, Philipp; Kargus, Steffen; Burger, Astrid; Kühle, Reinald; Günther, Patrick; Hoffmann, Jürgen; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119700/,569

The pandemic had not yet spread to most of the country, and there was a relative deficit of knowledge regarding treatments, prognosis, and prevention of the virus, making this experience relatively unique and challenging. As part of a surge plan, our institution converted nonclinical spaces, such as conference rooms, to inpatient care settings and placed elective surgeries on hold to free up resources. A central deployment office suspended anesthesiology resident rotations and instead assigned them to intensive care settings based on need. For the Montefiore Medical Center Department of Anesthesiology, preserving its academic mission and commitment to Graduate Medical Education was essential. Adaptations included changing the residency rotation structure to biweekly, converting didactics online, ensuring adequate case numbers for graduating residents, actively pursuing wellness interventions, and prioritizing the safety of the residents caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Wide-necked aneurysm can be defined with a dome-to-neck ratio or aspect ratio; however, clinical definitions of wide-necked aneurysms vary. This study aimed to determine the most useful definition of wide-necked aneurysm to predict the need for an adjunctive device. Methods Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 343 (62.1%) and 209 (37.9%) cases of unruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively, were treated in a single institution. For each aneurysm, the (1) dome-to-neck ratio, (2) aspect ratio, and (3) K-ratio (defined as [dome height+maximum dome width]/[2×maximum neck width]) were measured. We statistically analyzed patient data to determine which of the three ratios was most predictive of the need for adjunctive devices. Results Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 277 (50.2%) and 275 (49.8%) cases were treated with and without adjunctive techniques, respectively. The mean dome-to-neck ratio, aspect ratio, and K-ratio were 1.17±0.39, 1.58±0.61, and 1.37±0.47, respectively. The K-ratio was the strongest predictor of the use of adjunctive devices (P<0.001), and 1.3 was the most appropriate K-ratio cut-off value (sensitivity, 72.9%; specificity, 63.6%). Conclusions K-ratio was the most useful predictor of the need for adjunctive devices in the treatment of endovascular aneurysms. These results suggest that the K-ratio may be used to define wide-necked aneurysms requiring complicated management via adjunctive devices.","Park, Hyun Seok; Kwon, Soon Chan; Park, Eun Suk; Park, Jun Bum; Kim, Min Soo",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2019.21.4.193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030342/,569

In this cadaver study, ultimate load, stiffness, and Young's modulus were measured in tendon-to-tendon attachments with mismatched donor and recipient tendons, using pronator teres (PT) to extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to extensor digitorum communis (EDC). FCU-to-EDC attachments failed at higher loads than PT-to-ECRB attachments, but they had similar modulus and stiffness values. Ultimate tensile strength of the tendon attachments exceeded the maximum predicted contraction force of any of the transferred muscles, with safety factors of four-fold for the FCU-to-EDC and two-fold for the PT-to-ECRB transfers. This implies that size and shape mismatches should not be contraindications to tendon attachment in transfers. The strength safety factors suggest that postoperative immobilization of these transfers is unnecessary.","Fridén, J; Tirrell, T F; Bhola, S; Lieber, R L","The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",https://doi.org/10.1177/1753193413517327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413573/,569

In recent years, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional open venous ligation surgery. AIMS The aim of this study was to directly compare RFA and open saphenofemoral ligation. METHODS This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients undergoing surgical management over a 2-year period commencing from January 2011 were studied. Radiological success, peri-operative serological testing and hospital length of stay were documented. Procedural cost was calculated. A focused cohort analysis was undertaken to compare the initial 50 RFA procedures performed with the last 50. RESULTS During the study period, 296 patients underwent surgical intervention. A total of 204 patients underwent RFA. Sixty-six percent of all patients were female. RFA was associated with a reduction in overnight hospital stay (18 vs. 78 %, P = <0.001) when compared with open ligation with a success rate of 98 %. No significant inter-group difference was noted for 30-day readmission (p = 0.203). Focused cohort analysis identified an increase in hospital day case activity (74 vs. 90 %, p = 0.002), which contributed to a reduction in procedural cost (€1,024 vs. €971, p = 0.003) over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is a viable alternative to open repair offering excellent efficacy. It is however associated with a higher procedural cost than the open surgical option.","Aherne, T; McHugh, S M; Tashkandi, W; Byrne, J; Aljabi, Y; Moneley, D; Leahy, A; Naughton, P",Irish journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-014-1229-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25413474/,569

We aimed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Synovasure test to exclude infection in patients undergoing revision surgery for suspected early aseptic loosening of a total hip or knee arthroplasty. Patients and methods - In a prospective study design, 37 patients who underwent revision surgery for suspected early aseptic loosening (< 3 years after primary arthroplasty) were included. The Synovasure test was used intraoperatively to confirm the aseptic nature of the loosening and 6 tissue cultures were obtained in all cases. Exclusion criteria were patients with a preoperatively confirmed PJI, acute revisions (< 90 days after primary arthroplasty) and cases with malpositioning, wear, or instability of the prosthesis. Results - 5 of the 37 patients were diagnosed with a PJI based on the intraoperative tissue cultures. In only 1 out of these 5 cases this was confirmed by the intraoperative Synovasure test. No tests were falsely positive. Interpretation - In this case series the Synovasure lateral flow test had a low sensitivity to exclude PJI in patients with suspected aseptic loosening. The role of the Synovasure lateral flow test in the intraoperative exclusion of PJI during revision surgery for suspected early aseptic loosening appears to be more limited than previously indicated.","Scholten, Ruben; Visser, Jetze; Van Susante, Job L C; Van Loon, Corné J M",Acta orthopaedica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2018.1444301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29508664/,569

The objective of this scoping review is to map the available evidence in order to provide an overview of the services and resources offered to refugees, immigrants and other newcomers by settlement agencies to support emotional wellness and well-being. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The protocol to be followed for this scoping review is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute to provide a map of the current and emergent literature, and examine the extent, range and nature of this literature. The proposed scoping review will also identify the gaps in research pertaining to the emotional wellness of refugees, immigrants and other newcomers as well as summarise and disseminate research findings and provide direction for future reviews. Key databases for this scoping review include APA PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Academic Search Complete, and Education Research Complete. The database search start and end dates for this scoping review will be from inception to July 2020. The article searches will take place between August and October 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics is not required as the research will not involve human or animal subjects. The research is a scoping review, and thus relies on published and grey literature studies and documents. The findings of this proposed scoping review will be disseminated through future publications as well as presentations to relevant stakeholders, including immigrant serving agencies. We anticipate that this scoping review will identify gaps in research pertaining to the emotional wellness of refugees, immigrants and other newcomers. The results of this review will be the first comprehensive recent survey of emotional wellness practices employed by settlement agencies.","Goopy, Suzanne; Suva, Cesar; Hayden, K Alix; Silversides, Halley; Palova, Katerina",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938589/,569
163003,Business recovery in the European Union after the global financial crisis: lessons for the Coronavirus pandemic,2021,"The identification of a first case (e.g. by a disease-related death or hospitalization event) raises the question of the actual size of a local outbreak. Quick estimates of the outbreak size are required to assess the necessary testing, contact tracing and potential containment effort. Using general branching processes and assuming that epidemic parameters (including the basic reproductive number) are constant over time, we characterize the distribution of the first hospitalization time and of the epidemic size at this random time. We find that previous estimates either overestimate or largely underestimate the actual epidemic size. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the number of infectious individuals of the local outbreak over time. The upper bound is the cumulative epidemic size, and the lower bound is a constant fraction of it. Lastly, we compute the number of detectable cases if one were to test the whole local outbreak at a single point in time. In a growing epidemic, most individuals have been infected recently, which can strongly limit the detection of infected individuals when there is a delay between an infection and its potential detection. Overall, our analysis provides new analytical estimates about the epidemic size at identification of a first disease-related case. This piece of information is important to inform policy makers during the early stages of an epidemic outbreak.","Czuppon, P.; Blanquart, F.; Debarre, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.17.20233403v1?rss=1,569
163111,Discussing Privacy and Surveillance on Twitter: A Case Study of COVID-19,2020-06-11,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregating results from genome-wide association studies are state of the art to predict the susceptibility to complex traits or diseases. Novel machine learning algorithms that use large amounts of data promise to find gene-gene interactions in order to build models with better predictive performance than PRS. Here, we present a data preprocessing step by using data-mining of contextual information to reduce the number of features, enabling machine learning algorithms to identify gene-gene interactions. We applied our approach to the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset, an observational clinical study of 471 genotyped subjects (368 cases and 152 controls). With an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI = [0.72; 0.96]), the interaction-based prediction model outperforms the PRS (AUC of 0.58 (95% CI = [0.42; 0.81])). Furthermore, feature importance analysis of the model provided insights into the mechanism of Parkinson's Disease. For instance, the model revealed an interaction of previously described drug target candidate genes TMEM175 and GAPDHP25. These results demonstrate that interaction-based machine learning models can improve genetic prediction models and might provide an answer to the missing heritability problem.","Klinger, J.

163425,"Poverty, vulnerability, and the role of responsible management education in a post-COVID world",2021,"The emotional factors that influence adherence to public health guidelines for containing the spread of COVID-19 are poorly understood and are limiting policymakers’ ability to elicit compliance. In this article, we report the results of a nationwide survey conducted in April 2020 to gain insight into the relation between emotional stress and adherence to the public health guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We found that levels of anxiety and perceived risk from COVID-19 correlated with adherence to the CDC’s recommended cleanliness behaviors, such as handwashing. High anxiety increased individuals’ adherence in part by increasing the perceived seriousness of the risk COVID-19 posed to them. Anxiety and perceived risk were not, however, associated with adherence to social distancing guidelines. Our findings highlight a need for more research into the emotional factors that predict public compliance with the CDC’s recommendations. The results also indicate that policymakers may need to deliver different messages to promote different COVID-limiting behaviors, such as handwashing and social distancing. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

163592,Assessment of the burden on population due to transport-related air pollution: The Czech core motorway network,2020-07-15,"Purpose: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, adjustments were made to the standards for the provision of medical care to patients with rheumatological diseases, including an implementation of video consultations. The format of telemedicine services has its own characteristics in each country, largely dependent on how actively the Internet is used by the population. According to official data for 2018, Internet users in Russia accounted for 75.4% of the total population, while in the 55+ age group - only 36%. The aim of the study was to assess the development of telemedicine consultations (TMC) in the field of rheumatology in one of the medical offices in a large industrial center. Methods: The study included patients who applied for TMC. After it was held, all of them were asked to answer several questions in the Google form. The total number of participants was 36 patients. Results: A feature of the development of TMC was the extremely slow popularization of this method. Since the permission for this type of activity had been obtained, only 36 TMC were carried out in 5 months, while 488 traditional consultations have taken place. 77.8% of these were women, the overwhelming majority aged 31-50 years. 29 people lived in the immediate vicinity of the office, 3 - in the same region, but 4 people - in Russia up to 4000 km away from the office. About a quarter of the patients used online video consultations more than once. According to patients, 83.3% were able to completely, and 16.7% partially solve their problems. It was easy to establish contact for 86.1% of patients. The main reasons for applying for TMC were: it’s much faster than waiting in line for an in-person consultation, they just needed to clarify some issues (drug dose, control of analyzes). About half of the patients assessed the convenience of TMC (from home), the avoidance of infectious contacts in transport, and the quickness of urgent issues resolving. The main problems raised in the course of TMC were the routine control of laboratory tests and the correction of the therapy received. From this point of view, patients with gout and rheumatoid arthritis look the most promising for management. And, indeed, they constituted a significant part of those who applied for TMS. It’s remarkable that all patients noted their readiness to continue using TMC, since it turned out to be more convenient (100% of respondents' answers) due to the ability of receiving advice at a convenient time while staying at home, and the consultation is comparable to the face-to-face format (83.3%) in terms of quality;about half said that it saves time, and there is no problem of making an appointment with a doctor. For about a third of patients noted that this form of medical care is significantly cheaper than in-person visit. According to the doctor who conducted the consultations, 83.3% of patients were completely satisfied with the quality of this medical service and solved their problems. Conclusions: TMC represents a promising format of medical care for patients with rheumatic diseases.","Teplyakova, O.; Sarapulova, A.",Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2021.02.551,569

The ConnectPatientToDoctor study aimed to evaluate a connected telemonitoring platform,Cureety, in cancer patient care. Patients and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the Military Hospital Bégin. Each cancer patient was allowed to respond to a personalized symptomatology questionnaire based on CTCAE v.5.0, and personalized to their pathology and treatment. An algorithm evaluated the health status of the patient based on the reported adverse events and provided adapted recommendations. The calculated score allows to classify the patient into four different levels: (1) Correct State (green) (2) Compromised State (yellow) (3) State to be monitored (orange) (4) Critical State (red) In the case of orange or red classification, the patient was invited to call the hospital. In case of green or yellow classification, the patient received therapeutic advice set by the doctor, for each of the adverse events reported. The primary endpoint was to assess the feasibility of monitoring cancer patient with the connected platform. The secondary endpoint was to assess patient and caregivers' satisfaction. Results: There were 108 patients included in the program between July 1st, 2020 and January 31 , 2021. The median age was 70 and 77% presented a metastatic stage. The most represented cancer was prostate (50%), followed by lung (24%) and breast (15%). Overall, 1864 questionnaires were completed by the patients, resulting in 543 yellow alerts and 133 orange or red alerts. More than 60% of the alerts was managed through outpatient care or with a rapid intervention to resolve the adverse events. On a satisfaction scale from 1 to 10, where 10 was the highest, 72% of the patients responded with a 9 or 10. And all caregivers were satisfied because they could offer a better care, prioritize care, and save time. Conclusions: Participants in ConnectPatientToDoctor study reported that they had a clear benefit from using a connected platform to monitor their treatment. Patients felt less isolated and felt that they benefited from personalized care. This solution makes it possible to streamline the patient care process.","Helissey, C.; Duverger, C.; Vanquaethem, H.; Meghiref, Y.; Parnot, C.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.1581,569

For certain diseases, such as COVID-19, morphological impact across the multitude of blood cell types is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present a multiple instance learning-based approach to aggregate high-resolution morphological information across many blood cells and cell types to automatically diagnose disease at a per-patient level. We integrated image and diagnostic information from across 236 patients to demonstrate not only that there is a significant link between blood and a patient's COVID-19 infection status, but also that novel machine learning approaches offer a powerful and scalable means to analyze peripheral blood smears. Our results both backup and enhance hematological findings relating blood cell morphology to COVID-19, and offer a high diagnostic efficacy; with a 79% accuracy and a ROC-AUC of 0.90.","Cooke, C.

164112,"Students Attending School Remotely Suffer Socially, Emotionally, and Academically",2021,"COVID-19 healthcare professionals recommend the general population staying at home and remote contacting the authorities, e.g. via SMS messages, if they show symptoms like cough, body pain, fever, and breathing difficulties. Although this approach considers the patient self-report, it is not supported by physiological data, i.e. medical personnel does not have a remote mechanism to validate such symptoms. This paper proposes a system, called Rinku, to address the abovementioned scenario. Rinku integrates an electronic system (ClinicalKit) comprising biomedical sensors for body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, as well as a digital platform for storing and displaying the collected data. Rinku system aims to provide health professionals with relevant information to remotely validate COVID-19 symptoms. Rinku can handle simultaneous information from multiple patients and provide valuable data related to the severity of the reported symptoms, which in turn could help healthcare professionals to make management decisions to optimize their clinical resources. In this paper, the functionality of the ClinicalKit, communication between the IoT architecture and the cloud, and the monitoring of physiological parameters were tested. The results showed that the enclosure design is convenient, IoT architecture is functional and the tracking of temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels from subjects is promising. We consider that the Rinku system has the potential to provide an accurate forecast regarding the demand for clinical resources and take prompt actions related to this pandemic.","Rodriguez, F.; Gutierrez, S.; Reyes, B.

164320,Conversations editorial,2021,"Anthropogenic underwater noise has been identified as one of the main pressures on the marine environment. Considerable research efforts have been made to quantify acoustic soundscapes on different spatial and temporal scales in order to identify trends and investigate possible risks for the marine ecology. Measures to reduce the anthropogenic noise input into the seas are under discussion, including the reduction of vessel speed or re-routing of shipping lanes. The decline in maritime transport caused by the Covid-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to examine the associated extent of noise reduction. As part of an international initiative, coordinated by the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, acoustic data-sets from two measurement positions in the German Baltic Sea were investigated. Following the approach of a “Before-After Control-Impact” study the available recordings from the period before the Covid-19 pandemic, dating back to 2014, are compared to recordings from the year 2020. Monthly statistics from the period before the pandemic and from the year 2020 are compared. To account for varying natural conditions the measurements were sorted into categories of same prevailing sea state. Through this approach, measurements with equivalent natural noise impact are compared, focusing on the variability of the anthropogenic noise. A decline in sound pressure of 12 - 14 % for low frequency bands and a correspondence with decreasing marine mobility could be shown for both stations.","Basan, Fritjof Fischer Jens-Georg Kühnel Dennis",Frontiers in Marine Science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.689860,569
164423,Influence of Fiscal Policies and Labor Market Characteristics on Sustainable Social Insurance Budgets-Empirical Evidence from Central and Eastern European Countries,2021,"In the diagnosis of severe contagious diseases such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19, there is an urgent need for protein sensors with large refractive index sensitivities. Current terahertz metamaterials cannot be used to develop such protein sensors due to their low refractive index sensitivities. A simple method is proposed that is compatible with all geometrical structures of terahertz metamaterials to increase their refractive index sensitivities. This method uses patterned photoresist to float the split-ring resonators (SRRs) of a terahertz metamaterial at a height of 30 μm from its substrate that is deposited with complementary SRRs. The floating terahertz metamaterial has an extremely large refractive index sensitivity of 532 GHz/RIU because its near field is not distributed over the substrate and also because the complementary SRRs confine the field above the substrate. The floating terahertz metamaterial senses bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the protein binding of BSA and anti-BSA as BSA, and anti-BSA solutions with low concentrations that are smaller than 0.150 μmol/L are sequentially dropped onto it. The floating terahertz metamaterial is a great achievement to develop protein sensors with extremely large refractive index sensitivities, and has the potential to sense dangerous viruses. © 2021 Chinese Laser Press.","Silalahi, H.

164686,"The scale of evaluating instruction in pandemic process: Development, validation, and reliability",2021,"Purpose This paper explores how deservingness features in how line managers and employees with cancer negotiate post-diagnosis support in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach It draws on narrative interview data from people with cancer in the UK who were employed when diagnosed and line managers with experience of managing an employee with cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of occupational health and human resources staff and staff from a UK cancer support charity. Findings It shows that post-diagnosis support for employees with cancer was negotiated in subjective, individualised ways, drawing on pre-diagnosis workplace contribution as well as the perceived deservingness of cancer as an illness. Managerial support for employees with cancer was also influenced by post-diagnosis employee behaviours, particularly those that implied a readiness to return to work. Research limitations/implications The sample size and methods limit the generalisability of the results. However, sampling choices were instrumental in reaching a rich set of data, which enabled deeper understanding of individual workplace negotiations. Social implications Pervasive and unhelpful notions of deservingness in the context of ill-health and disability have distinct and worrying implications for ageing workforces, particularly across the Global North. This has been exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainty and insecurity triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result insight into the management of ill-health at work has never been more relevant, and can be used to inform policy and practice. Originality/value This exploratory paper extends debates usually reserved for social welfare and health provision to a new domain by exploring how deservingness features in line manager-employee interactions in the context of an employee diagnosis of cancer.","Remnant, J.",Employee Relations,https://doi.org/10.1108/er-06-2020-0285,569

COVID-19 outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities with BC are currently unknown. We sought to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes stratified by race/ethnicity. Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry (NCT04354701) was used to identify patients with invasive BC and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed in the U.S. between 2020-03-06 and 2021-02-04. The primary analysis was restricted to women who selfidentified as non-Hispanic White (NHW), nonHispanic Black (NHB), or Hispanic (H). Demographic, cancer characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated. COVID-19 outcomes included: hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, death within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and death from any cause during follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and Fisher exact tests were used to compare COVID19 outcomes across the 3 racial/ethnic groups. Results: A total of 1133 patients were identified of which 1111 (98%) were women;of which 575 (52%) NHW, 243 (22%) NHB, 183 (16%) H, and 110 (10%) other/unknown. Baseline characteristics differed among racial/ethnic groups. H were younger (median age: NHW 63y;NHB 62y;H 54y) and more likely to be never smokers (NHW 62%;NHB 62%;H 78%). NHB had higher rates of obesity (NHW 40%;NHB 54%;H 46%), diabetes (NHW 16 %;NHB 32%;H 20%) and combined moderate and severe baseline COVID-19 at presentation (NHW 28%;NHB 42%;H 28%). Cancer characteristics are as shown (Table). Significant differences were observed in outcomes across racial/ethnic groups including higher rates of hospital admission (NHW 34%;NHB 49%;H 34%;P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (NHW 3%;NHB 9%;H 5%;P=0.002), 30-day mortality (NHW 6%;NHB 9%;H 4%;P=0.043) and total mortality (NHW 8%;NHB 12%;H 5%;P=0.05) among NHB compared to NHW and H. Conclusions: This is the largest study to show significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes by racial/ethnic groups of women with BC. The adverse outcomes in NHB could be due to higher moderate to severe COVID-19 at presentation and preexisting comorbidities. H did not have worse outcomes despite having more active disease and recent anti-cancer therapy, including with cytotoxic chemotherapy - potentially due to younger age and nonsmoking status.

164742,Investigating the Relationship Between Air Quality and COVID-19 Transmission,2021-03-24,"COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social disruption has left many to struggle with changes to routines and feelings of uncertainty as the impact of the virus continues to unfold. Evidence suggests an increase in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress as a result. Given the well-documented association between physical activity and mental health-be it preventing the onset of depressive or anxious symptoms to minimizing the prognosis of certain conditions-we posit more emphasis be placed in health communications on physical activity as a coping strategy for Canadians. As the ramifications of COVID-19 continue, coupled with the concern of a pending second wave, identifying how Canadians are managing stress and mental health can inform the development of interventions aimed at mitigating the negative impact of COVID-19 on adults' overall wellness. Though social interactions and activities might look different right now, Canadians should be actively looking for safe ways to engage in health promoting and socializing behaviors-physical activity is one such behavior. Herein we explore how a representative sample of Canadian adults are coping with increased stress and mental health issues as a result of COVID-19 and identify a potential disconnect between considering physical activity as a strategy to support social connection and stress management and how Canadians are coping with the pandemic. Given the protective role of physical activity in supporting mental health, our perspective is that health communication efforts should focus on the mental health benefits of physical activity particularly during these uncertain times.","Faulkner, G.; Rhodes, R.

164810,Financial risk management and derivative instruments,2021,"Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have proven to be a valuable tool in systems biology to facilitate the discovery and understanding of protein function. Unfortunately, experimental PPI data remains sparse in most model organisms and even more so in other species. Existing methods for computational prediction of PPIs seek to address this limitation, and while they perform well when sufficient within-species training data is available, they generalize poorly to new species or often require specific types and sizes of training data that may not be available in the species of interest. We therefore present D-SCRIPT, a deep learning method for predicting a physical interaction between two proteins given just their sequences. Compared to existing methods, D-SCRIPT generalizes better to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Our approach encodes the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in contact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition; the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT is a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer. This structurally-motivated design enables interpretability of our model and, since structure is more conserved evolutionarily than sequence, improves generalizability across species. We show that a D-SCRIPT model trained on 38,345 human PPIs enables significantly improved functional characterization of fly proteins compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Evaluating the same D-SCRIPT model on protein complexes with known 3-D structure, we find that the inter-protein contact map output by D-SCRIPT has significant overlap with the ground truth. Our work suggests that recent advances in deep learning language modeling of protein structure can be leveraged for protein interaction prediction from sequence.

There has been substantial evidence supporting the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Airborne route has been considered as a major transmission pathway, which can spread the disease over a longer distance and time. The viral loads in the respiratory tract of a virus carrier are typically below 109 RNA copies/mL and are related to the emission rate of pathogens. Most particles expelled during respiratory activities are smaller than 1-2µm in diameter. Viral aerosols can remain infectious for hours under typical indoor conditions. Sunlight contributes greatly to the viability inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks in different scenarios are reviewed based on existing data. Most outbreaks were related to long-term care facilities, K-12 schools, restaurants, retail facilities, and offices. The Wells-Riley model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission is introduced, along with model parameters such as the quanta generation rate, virus-containing particle size distribution, and inactivation rate. The effectiveness of various IAQ control strategies for mitigating the airborne transmission risk is analyzed, including PPE, ventilation strategies, partitions, air cleaning, and disinfection technologies, and occupancy control strategies. Both benefits and costs should be considered in designing the control strategies.

Boron- containing compounds are attractive chemical agents, some of them act as proteases inhibitors. Objective: The present study explores the role of boronic moieties in molecules interacting on the binding site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Methods: Conventional docking procedure was applied by assaying boron-free and boron-containing compounds on the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB code: 6LU7). The set of 150 ligands includes bortezomib and inhibitors of coronavirus proteases. Results: Most of the tested compounds share contact with key residues and pose on the cleavage pocket. The compounds with a boron atom in their structure are often estimated to have higher affinity than boron-free analogues. Conclusion: Interactions and the affinity of boron-containing peptidomimetics strongly suggest that boron-moieties increase affinity on the main protease, which is tested by in vitro assays.

We present the case of a previously healthy 16-year-old adolescent boy with no preceding infectious symptoms who developed acute onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech subsequently diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). After performing a thorough diagnostic work-up, no clear etiology for AIS was identified. He was found to be COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction upon admission. Accumulating evidence supports a link between COVID-19 and a systemic prothrombotic state suggesting pediatric patients who present with AIS and no other risk factors should be screened for this novel virus and potentially for extracranial sources of thrombi. As the rates of positive COVID-19 infection increase in the pediatric population, pediatricians and other pediatric subspecialists should be aware of the potential neurological and cerebrovascular complications of this novel virus to avoid delays in evaluation and intervention.","Swartwood, S.; Nelson, G.

165688,Editorial: Insights into the future blended learning and corporate governance research in a COVID-19 world,2021,"Background and Objective Pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists worldwide have reported a marked increase in functional (conversion) disorders with tic-like behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients often report frequent viewing of Tourette Syndrome (TS) TikTok videos, suggesting disease modeling. We aimed to evaluate tic phenomenology in videos posted on TikTok. Methods The 100 most-viewed videos under #tourettes in TikTok were randomly assigned to two primary reviewers (n=3; <2 years independent practice), all pediatric neurologists specializing in movement disorders, for extraction and classification of tic phenomenology. Initial disagreements were solved by consensus. If not resolved, a senior reviewer (n=5; >2 years independent pediatric movement-disorder practice) served as tiebreaker. In addition, two primary and one senior reviewer rated each video on a Likert scale from 1= All the tics are typical of TS to 5= None of the tics are typical of TS. Mean scores and Spearman correlation between primary and senior reviewers were calculated. Results Six videos without tic-like behaviors were excluded. Most videos depicted coprophenomena (coprolalia: 53.2%; copropraxia: 20.2%), often with unusual characteristics. Frequently, videos demonstrated atypical phenomenology such as very strong influence by the environment (motor: 54.3%; phonic: 54.3%), aggression (19.1%), throwing objects (22.3%), self-injurious behaviors (27.7%), and long phrases (>3 words; 45.7%). Most videos portrayed atypical, non-tic behaviors (Median [IQR] Likert ratings: Primary 4.5 [4-5]; Senior 5 [3-5]). Primary vs. senior rater scores demonstrated moderate agreement (r = 0.46; p<0.001). Conclusions TS symptoms portrayals on highly-viewed TikTok videos are predominantly not representative or typical of TS.","Zea Vera, A. G.; Bruce, A.; Garris, J.; Tochen, L.; Bhatia, P.; Lehman, R.

Understanding host immune control efficacy and how different factors influence lung injury and disease severity are critical. Here, we established dynamical connections between viral loads, infected cells, CD8+ T cell-mediated clearance, lung injury, inflammation, and disease severity using an integrative model-experiment exchange. The model was validated through CD8 depletion and whole lung histomorphometry, which showed that the infected area matched the model-predicted infected cell dynamics and that the resolved area paralleled the relative CD8 dynamics. Inflammation could further be predicted by the infected cell dynamics, and additional analyses revealed nonlinear relations between lung injury, inflammation, and disease severity. These links between important pathogen kinetics and host pathology enhance our ability to forecast disease progression, potential complications, and therapeutic efficacy.","Myers, Margaret A.; Smith, Amanda P.; Lane, Lindey C.; Moquin, David J.; Aogo, Rosemary; Woolard, Stacie; Thomas, Paul G.; Vogel, Peter; Smith, Amber M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/555276,569
165884,Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Applications to Defeat COVID-19 Pandemic,2022,"A major challenge in the application of the CRISPR-Cas13d (RfxCas13d, or CasRx) RNA editing system is to accurately predict its guide RNA (gRNA) dependent on-target and off-target effect. Here, we performed CRISPR-Cas13d proliferation screens that target protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), followed by a systematic modeling of Cas13d on-target efficiency and off-target viability effect. We first designed a deep learning model, named DeepCas13, to predict the on-target activity of a gRNA with high accuracy from its sequence and secondary structure. DeepCas13 outperforms existing methods and accurately predicts the efficiency of guides targeting both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs (e.g., circRNAs and lncRNAs). Next, we systematically studied guides targeting non-essential genes, and found that the off-target viability effect, defined as the unintended effect of guides on cell viability, is closely related to their on-target RNA cleavage efficiency. This finding suggests that these gRNAs should be used as negative controls in proliferation screens to reduce false positives, possibly coming from the unwanted off-target viability effect of efficient guides. Finally, we applied these models to our screens that included guides targeting 234 lncRNAs, and identified lncRNAs that affect cell viability and proliferation in multiple cell lines.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has developed a DSS framework that incorporates all the main decision areas simultaneously in the context of cultural heritage. We fill this gap by focusing on design-science research and specifically by developing a DSS framework whose features support all the main decision areas for the sustainable management of cultural assets in a comprehensive manner. The main decision-making areas considered in our study encompass demand management, segmentation and communication, pricing, space management, and services management. For these areas, we select appropriate decision-making supporting techniques and data management solutions. The development of our framework, in the form of a web-based system, results in an architectural solution that is able to satisfy critical requirements such as ease of use and response time. We present an application of the innovative DSS framework to a museum and discuss the main managerial implications and future improvements.","Eleonora Di, Matteo Roma Paolo Zafonte Santo Panniello Umberto Abbate Lorenzo",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137070,569

In this paper, we demonstrate how this phenomenon constitutes various forms of theatre – immunity theatre, border theatre, behavioural theatre and equality theatre – doing so by drawing on perspectives from technology regulation, migration studies and critical geopolitics. Technological theatre and political theatre often serve valid functions, but these forms are problematic for several reasons. First, they involve real-world infrastructures that, while unlikely to accomplish the task at hand, will nevertheless last a long time and be repurposed. They therefore constitute governance by data infrastructure, diverting action and control away from elected legislators to for-profit contractors. Second, vaccine certification effectively legitimises inequalities between countries and people by formalising ways to distinguish between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated and to exclude the latter, thus reinforcing both mobility and connectivity divides. It serves as a way to (further) close borders and to regulate, through code and infrastructure, access to public goods such as employment and public space. Finally, the project of certification displaces a more important action, namely addressing the radical inequality in countries’ ability to combat the pandemic.","Milan, Stefania Veale Michael Taylor Linnet GUuml; Rses, Seda",European Journal of Risk Regulation : EJRR,https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2021.26,569

Specifically, this study covered the change of Air Quality Index (AQI) based on five pollutants, PM 10 , SO 2 , CO, O 3 , and NO 2 , contained in Jakarta's air before and during LSSR. The AQI data were provided by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Indonesia, from January 2019 to December 2020 at five different locations in Jakarta, with missing data for March and September 2020 due to unknown reasons. These data were grouped into the period before the LSSR from January 2019 to February 2020 and the period during LSSR from April 2020 to December 2020. In order to measure the change in the air quality of Jakarta before and during LSSR, we ran a chi-squared test to the AQI for each location and LSSR phase as well as paired one-sided t-test for the seasonal trend. The result of this study showed that, in general, LSSR improved the air quality of Jakarta. The improvement was mainly contributed by reduced transportation activities that were induced by LSSR. Further analysis on the seasonal pollutants trend showed a variation of AQI improvement in each phase due to their unique characteristics.

166366,Leading Schools and Districts in Times of Crisis,2021,"Early warning signals (EWS) identify systems approaching a critical transition, where the system undergoes a sudden change in state. For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators. Author summary The threat posed by infectious diseases has a huge impact on our global society. It is therefore critical to monitor infectious diseases as new data become available during control campaigns. One obstacle in observing disease emergence or elimination is understanding what influences noise in the data and how this fluctuates when near to zero cases. The standard data type collected is the number of new cases per day/month/year but mathematical modellers often focus on data such as the total number of infectious people, due to its analytical properties. We have developed a methodology to monitor the standard type of data to inform whether a disease is approaching emergence or disease elimination. We have shown computationally how fluctuations change as disease data get closer towards a tipping point and our insights highlight how these observed changes can be strikingly different when calculated on different types of data.","Southall, Emma; Tildesley, Michael J.; Dyson, Louise",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.021576,569

Due to the virus cross-infection and limited medical and healthcare resources, many countries have encountered difficulties in bearing or dealing with this situation. Fortunately, the vast majority of positive patients are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, so it is necessary to carry out isolation staying home and basically monitor their disease's progress to detect potential worsening signs promptly. According to the above issues, this work provides an effective solution by proposing a remote telehealth monitoring approach for infected subjects in self-isolation that is based on a multi-sensor fusion method. In this approach, we use a radar sensor to monitor basic activities and breathing patterns;we also obtain patient's blood oxygen saturation and heartbeat information through a smart wrist bracelet.

166658,Improving communication at NHS Nightingale Hospital Northwest: Medical updates to next-of-kin,2020,"Despite the pandemic's negative effect on the economy, it can help reduce emissions from energy consumption activities in line with the Paris Agreement, especially for high-emitter countries such as Indonesia. However, the policy response to COVID-19 may rebound the emissions to their pre-pandemic levels. To design an efficient policy that considers both economic and environmental variables, this study uses a computable general equilibrium model that assesses how COVID-19 and its stimulus policy will affect the macroeconomic indicator, energy consumption, and emissions at the national and regional levels. The results show that macroeconomic indicators generally performed worse with the current stimulus policy in the short run than in the long run. Refined petroleum energy consumption took the highest hit, followed by coal-based energy consumption and overall electricity demand. The pattern in emissions reduction is similar to the pattern of gross domestic product declination as well. The Sulawesi region particularly experienced the largest decrease in refined petroleum energy consumption. In contrast, the Java-Bali and Sumatra regions experienced the most coal-based energy consumption reduction and the largest emissions reduction. Should COVID-19 provide the impetus to develop more environmentally sound economic development, we would need better policy to address the recovery. Returning to pre-pandemic development will not lead to long-term environmental gain. This study offers policy recommendations for economic recovery and environmental improvement. The government should promote low-carbon technology, clean energy transition, more energy efficiency, and sustainable development to avoid the rebound effect of energy consumption and carbon emission. Coordination between central and local governments is also needed to formulate a fiscal policy inclined toward low-carbon pathways. © 2021","Hartono, D.; Yusuf, A. A.; Hastuti, S. H.; Saputri, N.

166913,Non-traditional security: An evolving solution to new challenges,2021,"Purpose The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have transformed the global outlook for international higher education. Given the rapid shift to online learning, the Tokyo Convention in the Asia-Pacific entrusted to UNESCO has become an important policy framework to facilitate regional collaboration, authoritative information sharing and recognition of qualifications across diverse modes of learning. This paper examines the role of the Tokyo Convention to establish an inclusive platform for monitoring and collaborative governance of mobility and internationalization based on fair and transparent recognition policies and practices in the Asia-Pacific. Design/methodology/approach In August 2019, a standardized survey instrument was sent by the Secretariat of the Tokyo Convention Committee at UNESCO Bangkok to competent recognition authorities in 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, including the eight State Parties to the Tokyo Convention that ratified the Convention as of the reporting period. In total, qualitative data from n = 27 countries/states was received and analyzed to assess implementation of the Tokyo Convention throughout the region. The research design illustrates how normative instruments such as the Tokyo Convention are monitored and assessed over time. Findings A multi-stakeholder approach based on collaborative governance is needed to effectively monitor implementation and implications of the Tokyo Convention for diverse higher education stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region. Research limitations/implications Implications include establishing baseline data and methods for monitoring implementation of the Tokyo Convention. Based on collaborative governance theory, the paper explores potential for a multi-stakeholder approach to promote mutual accountability in the Asia-Pacific and to develop mechanisms for inclusive participation in the governance of the forthcoming Global Convention on recognition. Originality/value As the first systematic review of its kind, this paper includes a unique dataset and insights into UNESCO's methodology to monitor implementation of standard-setting instruments for qualifications recognition in the Asia-Pacific.","Teter, W.

167297,Case Study of Drone Delivery Reliability for Time-Sensitive Medical Supplies With Stochastic Demand and Meteorological Conditions,2021,"This concluding chapter draws together data from the case study chapters to gain an understanding of the role of political communication during the pandemic and the way strategies were instituted within nations. We find across the phases of the crisis a range of differing strategies but four common themes. Firstly, crises exacerbate the trend towards personalisation. Secondly, the crucial role of the mass media in informing the public, but also the fact that tensions between the political and media spheres remain prevalent. Thirdly, we suggest that social media plays a largely positive role, despite being described as causing an infodemic, it was used far more to bring communities together. Finally, where misinformation prevailed, and tensions over measures became prominent, this was due to severe systemic polarisation existing which prevented messages of unity and calls to rally around the flag being adhered to. Hence political crises and instability create the conditions for the effects of a pandemic to be felt worse;given the parlous state of many of the world’s populations, these factors are likely to exacerbate this or future crises. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Darren Lilleker, Ioana A.

Objectives: This study aimed to compile a list of prospective homoeopathic medicines for the treatment and prophylaxis of the COVID-19 epidemic by conducting a systematic review and statistical analysis of clinical characteristics of this emerging coronavirus disease. Materials and Methods: A&gt; systematic review protocol was developed according to the reporting items of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Articles for review were selected from PubMed, World Health Organization database, MedRxiV, and BioRxiv. Studies in English and simplified Chinese from December 2019 to March 26 2020 were included. Data on clinical characteristics, laboratory and CT chest results of COVID-19 were extracted and analysed. Several symptoms and their intensity were statistically analysed. Results: Seventy-three studies were included. Amongst COVID-19 patients, fever (119.869 ± 24.425 [95% confidence intervals: 71.149-168.589]), dry cough (91.028 ± 19.555 [52.007-130.050]) and dyspnoea (24.594 ± 5.949 [12.722-36.465]) were the most common symptoms. Leucopenia (16.06 ± 5.07 [5.95-26.18]) in blood, ground-glass opacity (62.23 ± 18.82 [24.74-99.72]), patchy (21.48 ± 12.36 [3.13-46.11]) and consolidation (18.67 ± 9.18 [0.373-36.968]) in the lungs were observed. The selected sign and symptoms were repertorised, which resulted in a list of multiple homoeopathic medicines as potential medicines for COVID-19, led by Arsenic Album (94.59%) and Bryonia alba (91.89%).

167536,No Watchman in the Night: How Presidential and Congressional Responses to the Coronavirus Pandemic Undermine the Hamiltonian–Madisonian Model of Accountability,2021,"Background: Patients (pts) with cancer are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and death. Due to COVID-19 outcome heterogeneity, accurate assessment of pts is crucial. Early identification of pts who are likely to deteriorate allows timely discussions regarding escalation of care. Likewise, safe home management will reduce risk of nosocomial infection. To aid clinical decisionmaking, we developed a model to help determine which pts should be admitted vs. managed as an outpatient and which pts are likely to have severe COVID-19. Methods: Pts with active solid or haematological cancer presenting with symptoms/asymptomatic and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and USA were identified following institutional board approval. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from pt records. Clinical outcome measures were discharge within 24 hours, requirement for oxygen at any stage during admission and death. Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used for model derivation as it compared favourably vs. lasso regression. Relevant clinical features were identified using recursive feature elimination based on SHAP. Internal validation (bootstrapping) with multiple imputations for missing data (maximum ≤2) were used for performance evaluation. Cost function determined cut-offs were defined for admission/death. The final CORONET model was trained on the entire cohort. Results: Model derivation set comprised 672 pts (393 male, 279 female, median age 71). 83% had solid cancers, 17% haematological. Predictive features were selected based on clinical relevance and data availability, supported by recursive feature elimination based on SHAP. RF model using haematological cancer, solid cancer stage, no of comorbidities, National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, platelets, CRP and albumin achieved AUROC for admission 0.79 (+/-0.03) and death 0.75 (+/-0.02). RF explanation using SHAP revealed NEWS2 and C-reactive protein as the most important features predicting COVID-19 severity. In the entire cohort, CORONET recommended admission of 96% of patients requiring oxygen and 99% of patients who died. We then built a decision support tool using the model, which aids clinical decisions by presenting model predictions and explaining key contributing features. Conclusions: We have developed a model and tool available athttps://coronet.manchester.ac.uk/ to predict which pts with cancer and COVID-19 require hospital admission and are likely to have a severe disease course. CORONET is being continuously refined and validated over time.","Lee, R.; Wysocki, O.; Zhou, C.; Calles, A.; Eastlake, L.; Ganatra, S.; Harrison, M.; Horsley, L.; Huddar, P.; Khan, K.; McKenzie, H.; Palmieri, C.; Revuelta, J.

However, CyTOF-specific panel design and optimization represent challenges to wider adoption and standardization of immune profiling with CyTOF. To address this, Fluidigm recently commercialized its MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), which comprises a lyophilized 30-marker antibody panel that is able to identify all major circulating immune cell subsets and offers a streamlined solution for standardized human immune monitoring. However, in the course of applying the MDIPA to characterize large numbers of whole blood samples, we observed several instances of unusual aberrant staining patterns, most notably CD19 expression on non-B cells, which can potentially confound data analysis and lead to erroneous interpretation of results when using this assay. Here, we report that this complex phenomenon is mediated by donor-specific plasma factors that mediate non-specific interactions between specific antibodies in the MDIPA panel. Our findings additionally suggest specific strategies that can be used to mitigate the issue, including the use of PBMCs or lysed/washed whole blood to remove endogenous plasma prior to staining, or blocking specific antibodies in the MDIPA panel.","Geanon, Daniel; Lee, Brian; Rahman, Adeeb H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.30.405027,569
167907,"Health Crisis Measures and Standards for Fair Decision-Making: A Normative and Empirical-Based Account of the Interplay between Science, Politics and Courts",2021,"Background: A large proportion of patients present to the paediatric emergency department (PED) with non-urgent problems [1]. With growing pressures on services, there is a need to reduce unnecessary attendances. Children with rheumatological conditions may attend PED with flares of their condition or unrelated presentations. These patients may be immunosuppressed due to steroid, disease-modifying or biologic therapy;PED attendance may therefore pose a serious infection risk. Objectives: To evaluate why children with rheumatological conditions attend the PED and whether these attendances are avoidable. Methods: This study was run in Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, a UK hospital with a PED and tertiary paediatric rheumatology services. Patients under rheumatology who attend PED are usually seen directly. A dataset of all patients referred directly to paediatric rheumatology between 01/01/19 and 31/12/19 was obtained from electronic records (n=59). The age, sex and reason for attendence were collected, as well whether they were admitted/discharged. Further data on management was collected from discharge letters for those with joint pain/swelling. Results: This cohort had 36 females and 23 males, with an average age of 11.9 years (range 1-18). 28 were discharged (47.5%) and 30 were admitted (50.8%). One patient left before being seen. The average waiting time was 3.97 hours. Table 1 summarises reasons for attendance to PED and final outcome. The most common reason for attendance was joint pain/swelling (n=14, 23.7%). Of these, nine were discharged with advice on analgesia or steroid dosing and for early review in clinic. There was no documentation on whether there had been any attempt to access the available rheumatology helpline prior to attending PED. Non-rheumatology-related reasons for attendance are also shown in Table 1, and notably include 20 patients with infections, 75% of whom were admitted to hospital. Chicken pox was the second most common reason for attendance (n=5, 8.5%);all patients attending with chicken pox or shingles (n=6) were admitted. Conclusion: Our study shows that attendance to PED with joint pain/swelling is usually avoidable in patients known to paediatric rheumatology services. Appropriate alternative services are needed to reduce hospital attendances;nurse-led helplines are beneficial, but still face some challenges in both availability and accessibility [2]. It is also important that patients and parents are given action plans for acute flares, which would ideally involve early clinic review rather than PED attendance. Our data also showed that patients are spending a long time waiting in PED, which needs to be avoided particularly in the context of immunosuppression. This is especially poignant now in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct referral to rheumatology with non-rheumatological problems likely reflects a desire for specialist advice in the context of complex conditions and medications, for example with regards to infections whilst on immunosuppressive medications, or uncertainty about whether new symptoms are related to the underlying condition. Expansion of helpline services and new approaches such as remote consultations should be explored.","Al-Attar, M.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.4325,569

There is no doubt that people with higher body mass index suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19. One meta-analysis that pooled data on more than 399,000 people with COVID-19 found that those with obesity were 113% more likely to be hospitalized, 74% more likely to need intensive care and 48% more likely to die than those with lower BMIs. Researchers have attributed this increased risk to a constellation of physiological factors--from weakened immune responses due to chronic inflammation, to breathing problems and other conditions that often accompany obesity, such as type 2 diabetes.","Duong, Diana",Canadian Medical Association.

Despite growing interest in PPP/PFI, there are knowledge gaps in the literature. The authors’ aim is to analyse these knowledge gaps and define emerging themes to guide future research agendas. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a systematic literature review from 1990 to 2018 using the Scopus database. Findings: The authors define six emerging themes: risk definition and types of risks;value for money (VFM) and risk;risk sharing, allocation and transfer;financial risk;contractualisation and renegotiation of risk;and risk management and governance. They proposed a conceptualisation of potential development of PPP/PFI research through the three phases of risk management cycle, i.e. prospective, real time and retrospective. This paper revealed some new aspects that could help to analyse better risk and risk management in PPP/PFI to reach value for money (VFM) and to exploit the potential of PPP/PFI. Originality/value: Despite the increasing attention to PPP/PFI, further researches are required in relation to operational and post-operational risk studies, risk management and control, the role of trust. The authors’ analysis underlines the difficulties in how risk is perceived and how to ascertain VFM. In addition, the authors highlight how the increase of contract renegotiation is changing the provisions with reference to risk assignment creating market distortion. Risk should be managed as a cycle;PPP/PFI would benefit by engaging more with the risk management literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Tallaki, M.; Bracci, E.",International Journal of Public Sector Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijpsm-06-2020-0161,569

Although the teachers and students changed the teaching-learning method from face-to-face to virtual, they were not prepared to continue their education in this new educational system, in which each student's family had different mandatory elements (e.g., an Internet connection, computer, meeting solution). However, they continued the classes through meeting solutions to continue the school year through virtual classes but without any criteria to select the most suitable meeting tool. This paper evaluates two of the most commonly used meeting solutions for virtual university classes: Webex and Zoom. We used User Experience Questionnaire and Microsoft Reaction Cards to evaluate these solutions. The results showed that Zoom was significantly more attractive than Webex, although there was no significant difference between them in the classic aspects of usability or user experience.","Parra, O.; Granda, M.

A common pooling scheme is Dorfman pooling: test N individuals simultaneously. If the first test is positive - retest each individual. Methods: Using a probabilistic model, we analyze the false-negative rate (i.e., the probability of a negative result for an infected individual) of Dorfman pooling. Our model is conservative in that it ignores sample dilution effects, which can only worsen pooling performance. Results: We show that one can expect a 60-80% increase in false-negative rates under Dorfman pooling, for reasonable parameter values. On average, when separate testing misses, e.g., ten infected individuals - Dorfman pooling misses more than sixteen. Discussion: In most pooling schemes, identifying an infected individual requires positive results in multiple tests and hence substantially increases false-negative rates. It is an inherent shortcoming of pooling schemes and should be kept in mind by policy makers.","Daon, Y.; Huppert, A.; Obolski, U.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.02.20242651v1?rss=1,569
168953,Platform and Data Co-Operatives amidst European Pandemic Citizenship,2020,"Degenerative diseases of major internal epithelial organs such as liver, lung, and kidney account for more than one third of mortality worldwide. The huge demand for drugs able to limit epithelial tissue degradation and eventually restore its functionality, place mimics of the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the physiological ligand for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, at the forefront of potential drug candidates. HGF/SF is a growth and motility factor with essential physiological roles in development and regeneration of epithelial organs. Unfortunately, HGF/SF itself is unsuitable for therapy because naturally the factor acts only locally as a pleiotropic factor and has a poor in vivo distribution and shelf-life profile. We have therefore designed, produced, solved the crystal structure, and characterized the biochemical and biological properties of K1K1, a new engineered fragment of HGF/SF optimised for applications in tissue/organ regeneration. K1K1, a covalent dimer of the first kringle domain of HGF/SF, is recombinantly produced in bacterial cells, shows superior stability at physiological pH and ionic strength and is a potent receptor agonist as demonstrated in a wide range of biological assays with cells in culture and several in vivo studies. K1K1 has broad potential in regenerative medicine with diseases such as acute liver failure, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute kidney injury, and currently lung injury related to respiratory viral infection due to COVID-19. Significance The role of HGF/SF and the MET signalling pathway in homeostasis, protection, and regeneration of major organs such as liver, lung, and kidney has been well established. The increasing health burden due to degenerative diseases in our expanding and aging global population has driven research in regenerative therapies and while cell-based therapies have shown promising results, huge costs and technological challenges will hinder widespread application for the foreseeable future. Instead, protein-based therapy, in which a potent MET receptor agonist is administered to patients seems a viable alternative in many diseases currently lacking effective treatment. We describe here the design and characterisation of K1K1, a potent minimal Met receptor agonist with superior properties and equipotent biological activities when compared to native HGF/SF.","Leclercq, Bérénice; de Nola, Giovanni; Mougel, Alexandra; Taront, Solenne; Simonneau, Claire; Forneris, Federico; Adriaenssens, Eric; Drobecq, Hervé; Iamele, Luisa; Dubuquoy, Laurent; Gherardi, Ermanno; Melnyk, Oleg; de Jonge, Hugo; Vicogne, Jérôme",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.212654,569

I argue that P4C practitioners ought to reconsider what we mean by community in Community of Inquiry (CoI). The traditional Community of Inquiry model emphasizes face-to-face interactions in which the children and facilitator(s) are traditionally seated in a circle, synchronously wondering together. The CoI pedagogical model has, once again, served as a methodological starting-point for the place-based P4C I have tried to practice in my teaching, but it was also the model that I had to overcome while developing a virtual P4C course in a pandemic. Specifically, I argue that we ought to broaden vastly what we mean by ""community"" in ""Community of Inquiry"" in order to make Philosophy for Children more accessible for a virtual, and even asynchronous, learning environment.

This study was aimed to identify simple and swiftly available laboratory biomarkers to help facilitate effectual triage to categorize suspected COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: According to a standard protocol, we collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 140 patients who underwent diagnostic tests at Medical Laboratory Group, Tehran, Iran, from October 1 to November 28, 2020, based on PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Leukocyte parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP) and, ferritin levels were measured in patients with positive PCR COVID-19 test. Results 140 patients with COVID-19 infection were included in the study. The median age in women was 41.5 (23-60) years and 45.3 (22-68) years in men. Based on RT-PCR result, there were significant differences for neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts. Overall, 72.8% of patients had monocyte count more than 11 x109 /L. The mean neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for women was 2.8 (SD: 1.8) and 2.6 (SD: 1.7) for men. Only in 15 patients (10.7%) with respiratory symptoms, CRP level was more than 5 mg/L. Conclusion: We found a significant increase in monocyte count. Lymphopenia was also observed.

169800,Person-centered Approach Effectiveness in Human Resource Management in the Agriculture of Azerbaijan,2021,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) on Earth today has biogenic and anthropogenic sources. During the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of global NO$_2$ emissions have shown significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of NO$_2$ as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO$_2$ as an atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO$_2$ concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to less short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO$_2$. In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO$_2$ on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc can be detected with SNR ~5 within ~400 hours with a 15 meter LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2 - 0.7micron range where NO$_2$ has a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the NO$_2$ feature. Historically, global NO$_2$ levels were 3x higher, indicating the capability of detecting a 40-year old Earth-level civilization. Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral signatures of NO$_2$ on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several 100s of hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO$_2$ absorption in this region, and also because of masking features by dominant H$_2$O and CO$_2$ bands in the infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels could be used to place upper limits on the prevalence of NO$_2$ as a technosignature.","Kopparapu, Ravi; Arney, Giada; Haqq-Misra, Jacob; Lustig-Yaeger, Jacob; Villanueva, Geronimo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05027v1.pdf,569

As rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of minor virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients or identified from preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies.

The world closely monitors research in this area, especially through media coverage, which plays a key role in the dissemination of trustful information and in the public's understanding of science and health. On the other hand, anti-vaccine movements dispute space in this communication environment, which raises concerns of the authorities regarding the willingness of the population to get vaccinated. In this exploratory study, we used computer-assisted content analysis techniques, with WordStat software, to identify the most addressed terms, semantic clusters, actors, institutions, and countries in the texts and titles of 716 articles on the COVID-19 vaccine, published by The New York Times (US), The Guardian (United Kingdom), and Folha de Sao Paulo (Brazil), from January to October 2020. We sought to analyze similarities and differences of countries that stood out by the science denialism stance of their government leaders, reflecting on the severity of the pandemic in these places. Our results indicate that each newspaper emphasized the potential vaccines developed by laboratories in their countries or that have established partnerships with national institutions, but with a more politicized approach in Brazil and a little more technical-scientific approach in the United States and the United Kingdom. In external issues, the newspapers characterized the search for the discovery of a vaccine as a race in which nations and blocs historically marked by economic, political, and ideological disputes are competing, such as the United States, Europe, China, and Russia.

In this study, we discovered that a largely exposed seed region at the 3’ end of the crRNA is essential for target RNA binding and cleavage, whereas base pairing at a unique region at the 5’ end of the guide is required to trigger cOA production. Moreover, we uncovered that the natural variation in the composition of type III complexes within a single host results in different guide lengths, and hence variable seed regions. This shifting seed may prevent escape by invading genetic elements, while controlling cOA production very tightly to prevent unnecessary damage to the host.

The reason for this is speculative but may be related to patient and physician desire to keep patients out of the hospital and may provide further evidence that subjective reasons lead to an increase in hospital length of stay.","Lees, B; Bose, R; Donahue, EE; Johnson, SL; Naumann, RW",Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553465021009249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553465021009249,569
170783,Errors and uncertainties associated with the use of unconventional activity data for estimating CO2 emissions: the case for traffic emissions in Japan,2021,"Objective: Many companies in Japan have been increasingly interested in ""health and productivity management (H&PM)."" In terms of H&PM, we supposed that companies can enhance their employees' perceived workplace health support (PWHS) by providing support for workers' lively working and healthy living. This could then improve health-related QOL (HRQOL) by increasing PWHS. This study explored the relationship between PWHS and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020, we conducted an Internet-based nationwide health survey of Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study). A database of 27,036 participants was created. The question regarding the intensity of PWHS was measured using a four-point Likert scale. We used a linear mixed model (LMM) to analyze the relationship between the intensity of PWHS and the four domains of CDC HRQOL-4 (self-rated health, number of poor physical health days, number of poor mental-health days, and activity limitation days during the past 30 days). Results: In the sex- and age-adjusted and multivariate models, the intensity of PWHS had a main effect on self-rated health and the three domains of unhealthy days (physical, mental, activity limitation). There was also a trend toward worse HRQOL scores as the PWHS decreased. Conclusions: This study aimed to document the relationship between PWHS and HRQOL. We found that the higher the PWHS of Japanese workers, the higher their self-rated health and the lower their unhealthy days. Companies need to assess workers' PWHS and HRQOL and promote H&PM. H&PM is also necessary to maintain and promote the health of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kurogi, K.; Ikegami, K.; Eguchi, H.; Tsuji, M.; Tateishi, S.; Nagata, T.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; Ogami, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.01.21262994v1?rss=1,569
170882,The Responsibility to Protect: Locating Norm Entrepreneurship,2021,"The σ2 receptor is a poorly understood transmembrane receptor that has attracted intense interest in many areas of biology including cancer imaging, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. However, little is known regarding the molecular details of the receptor, and few highly selective ligands are available. Here, we report the crystal structure of the σ2 receptor in complex with the clinical drug candidate roluperidone and the probe compound PB28. These structures, in turn, templated a large-scale docking screen of 490 million make-on-demand molecules. Of these, 484 compounds were synthesized and tested, prioritizing not only high-ranking docked molecules, but also those with mediocre and poor scores. Overall, 127 compounds with binding affinities superior to 1 μM were identified, all in new chemotypes, 31 of which had affinities superior to 50 nM. Intriguingly, hit rate fell smoothly and monotonically with docking score. Seeking to develop selective and biologically active probe molecules, we optimized three of the original docking hits for potency and for selectivity, achieving affinities in the 3 to 48 nM range and to up to 250-fold selectivity vs. the σ1 receptor. Crystal structures of the newly discovered ligands bound to the σ2 receptor were subsequently determined, confirming the docked poses. To investigate the contribution of the σ2 receptor in pain processing, and to distinguish it from the contribution of the σ1 receptor, two potent σ2-selective and one potent σ1/σ2 non-selective ligand were tested for efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. All three ligands demonstrated timedependent decreases in mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury model, supporting a role for the σ2 receptor in nociception, and a possible role for σ1/σ2 polypharmacology. This study illustrates the opportunities for rapid discovery of in vivo active and selective probes to study under-explored areas of biology using structurebased screens of diverse, ultra-large libraries following the elucidation of protein structures.","Alon, Assaf; Lyu, Jiankun; Braz, Joao M.; Tummino, Tia A.; Craik, Veronica; O’Meara, Matthew J.; Webb, Chase M.; Radchenko, Dmytro S.; Moroz, Yurii S.; Huang, Xi-Ping; Liu, Yongfeng; Roth, Bryan L.; Irwin, John J.; Basbaum, Allan I.; Shoichet, Brian K.; Kruse, Andrew C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.441652,569

We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites. Of six parasites detected, one (Trichuris sp.) was associated with social grooming behaviors, but more specifically with direct physical contact with others. Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors. This study highlights the need for an understanding of a study population’s parasitic infections when attempting to interpret animal behavior.","Wren, Brandi; Ray, Ian S.; Remis, Melissa; Gillespie, Thomas R.; Camp, Joseph",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.329409,569
171015,Social Engineering Attacks in Healthcare Systems: A Survey,2022,"Three highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and established human-to-human transmission causing significant morbidity and mortality in the past 20 years. The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that additional outbreaks are likely to occur. Evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against infection with CoVs. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing pan-coronavirus protection. To this end, we previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and displays cross reactive binding to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is also maintained against the Alpha, Delta and Gamma variants of concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region on sarbecovirus spikes. A 1.74Å crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs. Thus, CV3-25 defines a novel site of sarbecovirus vulnerability that will inform pan-CoV vaccine development.","Hurlburt, Nicholas K.; Homad, Leah J.; Sinha, Irika; Jennewein, Madeleine F.; MacCamy, Anna J.; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Sholukh, Anton M.; Zhou, Panpan; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees; Stamatatos, Leonidas; Pancera, Marie; McGuire, Andrew T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.02.454829,569

To address this issue, we performed a cross-sectional study of 246 individuals to determine whether autoantibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related molecules were associated with COVID-19-related clinical outcomes. Moderate and severe patients exhibited the highest autoantibody levels, relative to both healthy controls and patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Random Forest, a machine learning model, ranked anti-GPCR autoantibodies targeting downstream molecules in the RAS signaling pathway such as the angiotensin II type 1 and Mas receptor, and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 as the three strongest predictors of severe disease. Moreover, while the autoantibody network signatures were relatively conserved in patients with mild COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, they were disrupted in moderate and most perturbed in severe patients. Our data indicate that the relationship between autoantibodies targeting GPCRs and RAS-related molecules associates with the clinical severity of COVID-19, suggesting novel molecular pathways for therapeutic interventions.","Marques, O.

In the age of digitization, this flexibility can be achieved by the intelligent interlinkage of systems and production resources, which enables the recording and processing of data to virtual images of all physical production processes. These virtual images are known as digital production twins and can be accessed by anyone at anytime and anywhere. Due to data-based optimization, this allows for a higher degree of flexibility regarding unexpected events as well as a higher performance and efficiency of production processes. In order to achieve these objectives, this paper focusses on the operational implementation of digital production twins within companies of single and small batch production.

172545,Reduction of Air Pollution in Poland in Spring 2020 during the Lockdown Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to identify the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor markets. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a large-scale survey on 16,000 firms from 82 industries in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and analyze the data set by using different machine-learning methods. Findings: First, job loss and reduction in state-owned enterprises have been significantly larger than in other types of organizations. Second, employees of foreign direct investment enterprises suffer a significantly lower labor income than those of other groups. Third, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market are heterogeneous across industries and geographies. Finally, firms with high revenue in 2019 are more likely to adopt preventive measures, including the reduction of labor forces. The authors also find a significant correlation between firms' revenue and labor reduction as traditional econometrics and machine-learning techniques suggest. Originality/value: This study has two main policy implications. First, although government support through taxes has been provided, the authors highlight evidence that there may be some additional benefit from targeting firms that have characteristics associated with layoffs or other negative labor responses. Second, the authors provide information that shows which firm characteristics are associated with particular labor market responses such as layoffs, which may help target stimulus packages. Although the COVID-19 pandemic affects most industries and occupations, heterogeneous firm responses suggest that there could be several varieties of targeted policies-targeting firms that are likely to reduce labor forces or firms likely to face reduced revenue. In this paper, the authors outline several industries and firm characteristics which appear to more directly be reducing employee counts or having negative labor responses which may lead to more cost–effect stimulus. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Le, L.

We established a program of rapid vaccination and evaluation of antibody-mediated response to all EUA COVID-19 vaccines in an inner city minority population to determine the factors that contribute to the poor seroconversion to COVID-19 vaccination in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of 126 patients with hematologic malignancies in the outpatient practices of our institution who completed their vaccination series with one of the three FDA EUA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J). We qualitatively measured Spike IgG production in all patients using the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay and quantitatively in 106 patients who completed their vaccination series with at least 14 days after the 2nd dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or 28d after the single J&J vaccine. Patient characteristics were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and associations between patient characteristics, cancer subtypes, treatments, and vaccine response were assessed using Fisher Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test. The majority of patients (74%) were minorities. Seventy patients (60%) received Pfizer, 36 patients (31%) Moderna, and 10 patients (9%) J&J. We observed a high-rate of seropositivity (86%) with 16 pts (14%) having a negative Spike IgG. Of the 86 minority patients included, 94% Blacks (30/32) and 87% (39/45) Hispanics showed seropositivity. The factors that contributed to significantly lower seroconversion rates included patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p=0.005), those who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (p=0.002), IVIG (p=0.01), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.00002), and CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Ab) (p=0.0000008). Plasma cell neoplasms (p=0.02), immunomodulatory agents (p=0.01), and proteasome inhibitors (p=0.01) had significantly higher seroconversion rates, and those with a history of prior COVID-19 (11%, 12/106) had significantly higher antibody titers (p=0.0003). The positivity rate was 86% (37 seropositive, 6 seronegative) for autologous HSCT and 75% (3 seropositive, 1 seronegative) for allogeneic HSCT. No life-threatening AE were observed. We show high seroconversion rates after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in non-White patients with hematologic malignancies treated with a wide spectrum of therapeutic modalities. Vaccination is safe, effective, and should be encouraged in most patients with hematologic malignancies.

In Vietnam, the food delivery service is rising rapidly and opening a large gateway of opportunities for numerous OFD platforms, also making it a competing business market in this country. Thus, to keep up with the ever-changing market dynamics, there are numerous measures and dimensions for the OFD entrepreneurs to take into consideration towards sustainable development. This paper’s objective is to evaluate major OFD companies in Vietnam based on a comprehensive set of criteria, which are social and environmental criteria (healthy and safety, information security, and environmental impact), economic criteria (delivery cost, operational capability, and risk management), service quality (order fulfillment, delivery speed, convenience of payment, online/offline service level, and customer feedback), and technology (web design, realtime tracking systems, and marketing techniques). To achieve this objective, this work proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)-based framework combining the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS). The FAHP is used to generate criteria weights in which fuzzy set theory is applied to translate the linguistic evaluation statements of experts. Then, WASPAS is used to rank the OFD companies against the selected criteria. The evaluation criteria that have obtained maximum weight priority in the FAHP analysis are “convenience of payment”, “delivery speed”, “online service level”, “order fulfillment”, and “delivery cost”. From the final ranking of WASPAS, Foody is today the best performing OFD player in Vietnam regarding the selected criteria, followed by GrabFood and Now. The proposed methodology can be an accurate and robust evaluation model for the industry, while the managerial implications of this study provide significant materials for decision-makers in the OFD market in improving their businesses towards sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.","Nguyen, N.

Laws that respond to emergencies can create exceptions to rules that protect human rights. In long lasting emergencies, these exceptions can become the rule, diluting human rights and eroding the rule of law. In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted states to change rules governing commercial and personal activities to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many governors’ executive orders were challenged as violations of the constitutionally protected rights of those affected. Judges are deciding whether emergencies can justify more restrictions than would be permitted in normal circumstances and whether some rights deserve more protection than others, even in an emergency. This article analyzes ongoing litigation involving emergency restrictions on religious freedom and access to reproductive health services.

In 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the organisation experienced an increase in client referrals. The multidisciplinary team considered ethical implications to create policies, procedures and ways of working via remote practice. This article considers the diversification of approaches to Dramatherapy when working remotely, including framing and its impact on the therapeutic alliance. It considers clients who began interventions remotely and those who transitioned from in-person working to remote. The article takes a duoethnographic approach voicing Dramatherapists? personal experiences and reflections of transitioning their practice. Thematic analysis is applied to the therapist?s data set and a small-scale collection of client feedback to enhance meaning-making. Findings are presented through inclusion of therapist and client vignettes, including themes of feeling deskilled, adaptivity, assessing, disclosures, framing, therapeutic alliance and facilitation. Exploration of experiences shared by therapist and clients further informs Dramatherapy practice both now and for the future. The Dramatherapists conclude by identifying that an effective alliance can occur remotely, and that Dramatherapeutic techniques can be diversified into the world of remote practice. In addition, providing remote Dramatherapy could widen the diversity of individuals who can access.","Buxton, Sarah Morley Rebecca",Dramatherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/02630672211042531,569

The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented an urgent need for new and better diagnostic methods, with colorimetric LAMP utilized in numerous studies for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the sensitivity of colorimetric LAMP in early reports has been below that of the standard RT-qPCR tests, and we sought to improve performance. Here we report the use of guanidine hydrochloride and combined primer sets to increase speed and sensitivity in colorimetric LAMP, bringing this simple method up to the standards of sophisticated technique and enabling accurate and high-throughput diagnostics.","Zhang, Yinhua; Ren, Guoping; Buss, Jackson; Barry, Andrew J.; Patton, Gregory C.; Tanner, Nathan A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.132894,569

Methods: To characterize the vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the child care workforce. Providers were identified through various national databases and state registries. A link to the survey was sent via email between May 26 and June 23, 2021. Out of 44,771 potential respondents, 21,663 responded (48.4%). Results: Overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers (78.1%, 95% CI [77.3% to 78.9%]) was higher than that of the U.S. adult population (65%). Vaccination rates varied from 53.5% to 89.4% between states. Vaccine uptake differed significantly (p < .01) based on respondent age (70.0% for ages 25-34, 91.5% for ages 75-84), race (70.0% for Black or African Americans, 92.5% for Asian-Americans), annual household income (70.7% for <$35,000, 85.0% for>$75,000), and childcare setting (72.9% for home-based, 79.7% for center- based). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers was higher than that of the general U.S. adult population. Those who were younger, lower income, Black or African American, resided in states either in the Mountain West or the South, and/or worked in home- based childcare programs reported the lowest rates of vaccination; state public health leaders and lawmakers should prioritize these subgroups for placement on the policy agenda to realize the largest gains in vaccine uptake among providers.","Patel, K.; Malik, A.

In present scenario due to covid-19, the mask has been an important part of our live for our safety as well as for the others safety so there is a need for efficient face mask detection applications in crowded areas like shopping malls, public transportation etc. To ensure safety of the people in the surroundings. Face Mask Detection using NI LabVIEW. In this project a real-time system is developed to detect whether the person is wearing a mask or not by acquiring a real-time image of him through a Camera. The main challenges in detecting the mask are there are masks with various colours and patterns and secondly the background, light intensity are also the factors that affect the result. So, all these factors should be taken into consideration while developing the system in real-time. This system used for this application consists of vision development module. Vision development module helps to develop applications for machine vision and image processing applications we can use it with LabVIEW for real- time systems. A camera with good pixel quality is used for image acquisition. The captured image is of RGB format, it is difficult to analyse the image in this format, so it undergoes colour plane extraction in this only a single plane of the image is considered which separates the mask from surroundings and results in a grey scale image for further processing. The image later is compared to a custom-made template dataset using pattern matching algorithm from vision assistant which helps to detect the mask region. overlaying techniques are used to highlight the mask region which shows that the person is wearing the mask. © 2021.

174009,The Impact of the Pandemic on Vehicle Traffic and Roadside Environmental Pollution: Rzeszow City as a Case Study,2021,"We tested low-dose naltrexone/acetaminophen combination for episodic migraine prevention. We randomly assigned patients to naltrexone/acetaminophen (n=6) or placebo (n=6) for a 12-week double-blind treatment. Non-responders continued into open-label treatment with naltrexone/acetaminophen (n=5) for additional 12 weeks. Patients were adults who experienced 5 to 17 (average 9.7) migraine days at baseline. The primary endpoint was the mean change in the monthly migraine days during the last 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. The key secondary endpoint was the mean change in the monthly migraine days from the 4-week double-blind follow-up (2nd baseline) to the last 4 weeks of the open-label treatment period. The magnitude of the treatment effect for naltrexone/acetaminophen observed in the double-blind period was 2.2 fewer monthly migraine days than placebo (p=0.43). Four out of 6 (66.7%) naltrexone/acetaminophen-treated patients experienced 75% reduction in migraine days compared to 1 out of 6 (16.7%) placebo-treated patients (p=0.09). In the open-label phase, treatment with naltrexone/acetaminophen (n=5) led to 8.2 fewer mean monthly migraine days (from 11.8 to 3.6), representing 69.5% improvement (p=0.03), and 100% of the patients experienced a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days. Adverse events were mild/moderate and transient, included dry mouth, fatigue, sedation, nausea, and feeling jittery. We postulate that naltrexone's toll-like receptor (TLR4) antagonism properties prevent pro-inflammatory cytokines' production in the trigeminal ganglion averting ''overactive nerves'' and migraine. Although this trial used low-dose naltrexone (defined as 1 - 5 mg/day), we postulate mid-dose naltrexone (MDN) (defined as 6 - 10 mg/day) may offer a greater migraine prevention control.","Toledano, A.

174101,The effect of covid19 on the discretionary asset impairments in the quarterly report,2021,"The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 sparked a dispute concerning its origin. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 originated through pangolin-coronavirus (Pan-CoVs) from the SARS-CoV-related-bat-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs) rather than from SARS-CoV-2-related-bat-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs), in contrast to the previous thought. Further, our analyses strongly suggest that the Pan-CoVs evolved from the SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs without recombination. Further, our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs’ perhaps jumped into the pangolin, which forced the viruses to mutate and adapt to the new host, and resulted in the origin of Pan-CoVs. Surprisingly, the Pan-CoVs formed an evolutionary intermediate between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs at the spike gene. Our findings also suggest that the Pan-CoV/GX and Pan-CoV/Guangdong lineages recombined to form the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene. We also found evidence that the SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs spike gene evolved via recombination between Pan-CoV/Guangdong and SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs. Overall, our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 emerged from SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs through host jumping.","Desingu, Perumal Arumugam; Nagarajan, K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459210,569

In a concurrent mixed methods study, we investigated whether goal conflict and negation of goal conflict were associated with goal outcomes (progress, confidence, motivation) and what strategies partners used during the COVID-19 pandemic to negotiate goal conflict. Survey participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and interview participants (n = 48) attended a semi-structured interview. Results showed that higher goal conflict was associated with lower goal outcomes, and successful negotiation of goal conflict was associated with better goal outcomes. Qualitative analyses identified three goal conflict negotiation strategies (compromise, integration, concession). Conversations focused on both practical and emotional needs and included respectful communication and space from conflict (timeout or avoidance). The mixed methods results suggest that goal conflict was low during the pandemic and participants were often able to negotiate goal conflict resulting in better goal outcomes.

This study compared outcomes between patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS who received prone positioning and those who received ECMO. Methods This retrospective cohort study included eight tertiary referral centers in Taiwan. All patients who were diagnosed as having influenza pneumonia-related severe ARDS were enrolled between January and March 2016. We collected their demographic data and prone positioning and ECMO outcomes from medical records. Results In total, 263 patients diagnosed as having ARDS were included, and 65 and 53 of them received prone positioning and ECMO, respectively. The baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score did not significantly differ between the two groups. The 60-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the ECMO group than in the prone positioning group (60% vs. 28%, p = 0.001). A significantly higher mortality rate was still observed in the ECMO group after propensity score matching (59% vs. 36%, p = 0.033). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, usage of prone positioning or ECMO was the single independent predictor for 60-day mortality (hazard ratio: 2.177, p = 0.034). Conclusions While the patients receiving prone positioning had better outcome, the causality between prone positioning and the prognosis is unknown. However, the current data suggested that patients with influenza-related ARDS may receive prone positioning before ECMO support.","Chang, Ko-Wei; Hu, Han-Chung; Chiu, Li-Chung; Chan, Ming-Cheng; Liang, Shinn-Jye; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chen, Wei-Chih; Fang, Wen-Feng; Chen, Yu-Mu; Sheu, Chau-Chyun; Chang, Wei-An; Wang, Hao-Chien; Chien, Ying-Chun; Peng, Chung-Kan; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Kao, Kuo-Chin",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664621004794; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664621004794?v=s5,569

Tourism was significantly affected, and numerous authors are discussing future implications for the industry. However, only a few studies consider the effects of COVID-19-related measures on tourism's demand side. For the state of Bavaria (Germany), we introduce the relevant legislative measures and their implications on tourism demand. Following Sigala's (2020) suggestion, we illustrate the tourism demand development during the pandemic in space and time by analysing Bavaria's overnight stays on the districts' administrative level. For the first nine months of the ongoing pandemic, we identify the district's population density, its relative location to major cities, and tourism intensity being decisive for both, decline and recovery. Recommendations for policy action can be derived directly from the different spatial and temporal developments we have identified. Thus, it appears that individual districts vary considerably, especially in the speed and extent of their recovery following the first shutdown, in part due to the factors identified. Due to the varying degrees to which the districts and their tourism businesses recover after the crisis, we argue that customised, regionally differentiated political measures should be considered.","Schmude, J.; Filimon, S.; Namberger, P.; Lindner, E.; Nam, J.

Examinations were cancelled, rotations to other specialties were suspended with little information available regarding the immediate impact and enduring consequences of the pandemic. Trainee morale in AMU dropped during this uncertain period, which this project aimed to address.To identify baseline levels of morale, an anonymous survey was distributed to all AMU trainees at Musgrove Park Hospital via social media, asking to rate level of agreement using a Likert scale with several wellbeing statements such as ‘I feel happy at work’ and ‘I feel part of the AMU team’. The introduction of a cake rota encouraged trainees to pick a date they would provide cake for the team. Every Friday, after AMU ward round had finished, the team could eat together, whilst also offering an opportunity to socialise as a group. The survey was then redistributed to ascertain post-intervention levels of wellbeing.Responses to the question ‘I look forward to coming to work’ were scored more positively post-intervention, with 50% now strongly agreeing with this statement, compared to 0% prior. Similarly, trainees demonstrated an increasingly positive response to the statements ‘I feel part of the AMU team’, ‘there is a spirit of co-operation and teamwork within my team’ and ‘I get along well with my co-workers’, as 100% of trainees now strongly agreed, compared to 43% pre-intervention. This was echoed in the free text comments at the bottom of the survey, where one individual commented this was a ‘great idea to encourage team camaraderie’.Introducing simple measures (such as a weekly cake rota) promoted teamwork, collaboration, and a sense of unity, to help address a decline in trainee morale resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Longer term, this could improve individual wellbeing and maintain enthusiasm for a job which can be challenging and unpredictable, attributes which could be valuable as we enter a post-COVID world.","Parker, Hannah",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.22,569

A dataset of 5644 samples and 111 attributes collected at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil is considered in this paper. After necessary preprocessing 57 attributes are used for COVID-19 detection, while 67 attributes are considered for ICU requirement prediction. Using scikit-learn library of Python programming language, the most important features for both cases are found out. A number of base as well as ensemble classifiers are applied to the resultant datasets for the two cases. Results show that COVID-19 detection can be predicted with an accuracy of 94.39% and recall of 92% using stacking ensemble with random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and logistic regression (LR). Results also show that ICU requirement can be predicted with an accuracy of 98.13% and recall of 99% using stacking ensemble with RF, extra trees and LR.","Podder, P.; Mondal, M. R.

What often resulted was a publication in a prestigious international journal (or a thesis or dissertation), authored by academics from the global north, replete with recommendations on how to do things better in Africa. Sometimes these foreign researchers were junior postgraduate students or research assistant. Mindful of the exploitative nature of such imperialistic research, the South African (SA) Ministry of Health, in its guidance on research, instituted measures to end safari research. The South African Good Clinical Practice (SAGCP) guideline made it mandatory that every biomedical research project had to be led by an SA principal investigator resident in the country and that all research in SA had to be approved by an SA research ethics committee (REC) registered with the National Health Research Ethics Council (NHREC). Both the SAGCP guideline and the research ethics guidance from the Department of Health are in the process of revision. It is important that these guidelines incorporate ethical and legal issues related to digital health research so that all South Africans - participants, clinicians, academics, REC members, regulators, researchers and medical journal/newsletter editors - are acutely aware of potential loopholes in the system, as has been exposed by the abortion study in the latest issue of Medical Brief.

Through multi-dimensional visualization, we are able to compare the reduction in mobility from the different lockdown periods for each locality selected, simultaneously considering multiple place categories provided in CMR. In addition, our analysis comprises a 56-day lockdown period for each locality and COVID-19 wave, which we analyze both as 56-day periods and as 14-day consecutive windows. Methods We use locality-wise calibrated CMR data, which we process through seasonal-trend decomposition by LOESS (STL) to isolate trend from seasonal and noise effects. We scale trend data to draw Pareto-compliant conclusions using radar charts. For each temporal granularity considered, data for a given place category is aggregated using the area under the curve (AUC) approach. Results In general, reduction rates observed during the first wave were much higher than during the second. Alarmingly, December holiday season mobility in some of the localities reached pre-pandemic levels for some of the place categories reported. Manaus was the only locality where second wave mobility was nearly as reduced as during the first wave, likely due to the P1 variant outbreak and oxygen supply crisis.","Cavalcante da Silva, Gabriela Monteiro de Almeida Fernanda Oliveira Sabrina Wanner Elizabeth F.; Bezerra, Leonardo C.

One hypothesis was that people share a high proportion of the same VDJ-recombined antibody genes, but this has been disproven.5,6 An alternative is that people share a high proportion of functionally similar antibodies,7,8 but testing this hypothesis requires a method for measuring functional similarity that scales to the millions of antibodies per repertoire and across multiple repertoires, which is impossible experimentally. We recently described a framework for doing so computationally,9 which revealed that repertoires consist of loose overlapping functional classes of antibodies with similar antigen-binding capacities;10–12 this framework allowed us to estimate a repertoire’s antigen-binding capacity, τ, for the ideal target of any given antibody. Here, we show that this framework supports the second hypothesis, and provide the first comprehensive demonstration of overwhelming functional overlap between repertoires from 20 different individuals directly from sequence, without need of binding studies. Overlap is highest among the young and falls with age, due to the selective loss of antibodies that represent a core set of shared or “public” antigen-binding capacities. We reveal considerable heterogeneity in antigen-binding capacities for antibodies against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2, and show that while some of these classes shrink with age, others persist across individuals. These discoveries change our understanding of repertoire diversity and have implications for vaccine and therapeutic-antibody development, especially for the aged.","Arora, Rohit; Arnaout, Ramy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.159699,569

Applying and removing restrictions on a system with a given latency as represented by an epidemic outbreak (and formally comparable with mechanical inertia), may create critical instabilities, overshoots, and strong oscillations in the number of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined in a practical way as the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare system. A good understanding of the system reaction to any change of the input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID), which is a widely used technique in various physics and technological applications. In this paper, this control theory to is proposed to be applied epidemiology, to understand the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions and to reduce epidemic damages through the correct tuning of the containment policy. Regarding the synthesis of this interdisciplinary approach, the extended to the susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model name “SIR-PID” is suggested.","Ianni, Aldo Rossi Nicola",Physics,https://doi.org/10.3390/physics3030031,569

176284,Climate solutions to meet the suburban surge: leveraging COVID-19 recovery to enhance suburban climate governance,2021,"Background Modern antiretroviral therapies (ART) have decreased the prevalence of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Nonetheless, we continue to see children and adolescents with HIVAN all over the world. Furthermore, once HIVAN is established in children, it is difficult to revert its long-term progression, and we need better animal models of childhood HIVAN to test new treatments. Objectives To define whether the HIV-1 trans-activator (Tat) gene precipitates HIVAN in young mice, and to develop an inducible mouse model of childhood HIVAN. Design/Methods An HIV-Tat gene cloned from a child with HIVAN was used to generate recombinant adenoviral vectors (rAd-Tat). rAd-Tat and LacZ control vectors (2 × 109) were expressed in the kidney of newborn wild type and HIV-transgenic (Tg26) FVB/N mice without significant proteinuria (n = 5 - 8 per group). Mice were sacrificed 7 and 35 days later to assess their renal outcome, the expression of HIV-genes and growth factors, and markers of cell growth and differentiation by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or Western blots. Results HIV-Tat induced the expression of HIV-1 genes (env) and heparin binding growth factors in the kidney of HIV-Tg26 mice, and precipitated HIVAN in the first month of life. No significant renal changes were detected in wild type mice infected with rAd-Tat vectors, suggesting that HIV-Tat alone does not induce renal disease. Conclusion This new mouse model of childhood HIVAN highlights the critical role that HIV-Tat plays in the pathogenesis of HIVAN, and could be used to study the pathogenesis and treatment of HIVAN in children and adolescents. Summary statement We developed a new inducible mouse model system of childhood HIV-associated nephropathy, and demonstrated that HIV-Tat plays a critical role in this renal disease acting in synergy with other HIV-1 genes and heparin binding cytokines.","Tang, Pingtao; Das, Jharna R.; Li, Jinliang; Yu, Jing; Ray, Patricio E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.081851,569
176412,Covid-19 Industry Survey June 2020,2021,"The main reason which makes epidemics so dangerous and difficult to contain is their highly infectious nature. In the case of Covid-19 also, data shows that its contagious nature is increasing along with its various mutant strains. One of the primary methods adopted to fight the pandemic has been to break the infection chain and thus reduce the rate of persons getting infected every day, through lockdowns, self-isolation, social distancing, and other measures. But although there are already many existing epidemic models, to predict and track the spread of the disease, it is evident from the difference in the rates of infection and fatalities in different countries, that a uniform set of parameters is not sufficient to accurately predict the curves. In this paper, we have suggested some additional benchmarks that could be considered and at a higher granularity for more accurate predictions at more local levels. We also propose an IoT-based framework for the collection of such types of data through smartphones for more consolidated information to be made available to the authorities, for the effective management of epidemics. The framework also issues warnings to other users through smartphones if the app detects the presence of a potentially infected person within close range. © 2021 IEEE.","Datta, S.; Roy, M.; Kar, P.","22nd IEEE International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing, HPSR 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/hpsr52026.2021.9481844,569

Due to ventilator shortage and healthcare systems strain, affordable interventions such as awake prone positioning has been used to improve oxygenation, however, the effect of this intervention on patient-important outcomes is uncertain. The COVI-PRONE trial aims to determine if awake prone positioning in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Study design A pragmatic, multicenter, international, parallel-group, and stratified randomized controlled trial, aiming to enrol 400 hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Participants The target population is hospitalized adults with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, hypoxemia that requires [≥]40% oxygen or [≥] 5 L/min by nasal cannula, and abnormal chest x-ray. We will exclude patients with any of the following: immediate need for intubation; altered mental status; contraindication to prone positioning; hemodynamic instability; body mass index > 40 kg/m2; third trimester pregnancy; do not intubate status; previous enrolment or intubation within the same hospital admission; and prone positioning for more than one day prior to randomization. Study intervention and control Following informed a priori or deferred consent, eligible patients will be centrally randomized to either the intervention arm (prone positioning) or standard of care (no prone positioning). Patients randomized to the prone position will be required to either self-prone or assist-prone for a total of eight to ten hours per day until they meet pre-specified stopping criteria. Study outcomes The primary outcome is invasive mechanical ventilation at 30-days of randomization. Other outcomes include mortality at 60 days, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation free days at 30 days, hospital length of stay at 60 days, days alive and outside of the hospital at 60 days, complications of proning, and serious adverse events.","Al Duhailib, Z.; Arabi, Y.; Culgin, S.; Weatherald, J.; Parhar, K.

The relationship between psychosis and corticosteroids treatment is well known. However, there are relatively limited data so far correlating psychosis and SARS-CoV-2.ObjectivesTo describe a case of manic psychosis in a 55-year-old woman treated with corticosteroids for COVID-19 infection. Discuss the etiopathogenic factors involved in psychosis in patients infected by COVID-19.MethodsWe present the case of a 55-year-old woman, without previous psychiatric history, who was admitted to psychiatry due to a psychotic episode with maniac symptoms. Three weeks earlier, the patient had been admitted to Internal Medicine for bilateral SArs-CoV2 pneumonia, under treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. The patient presents a verbose and salty speech, euphoric mood with hyperergia, subjective increase of capacities, insomnia and delusional ideation with mystical-spiritual content with delusional interpretations and auditory hallucinations. The patient comes from Ukraine and she has been living in Spain for 20 years. She works as a household assistant. The patient relates various psychosocial stressors throughout her life.ResultsComplementary diagnostic tests were without alterations. Low-dose antipsychotic treatment is prescribed, with a rapid recovery within a week.

The processing of international agricultural trade data using machine learning techniques needs to be improved to perform effective analysis of agricultural trade. An essential issue for international agricultural trade is the accurate yield estimation for the numerous crops involved in international trade. Data mining techniques are the necessary approach for accomplishing practical and effective solutions for this problem. This paper combined the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model to conduct data mining and developed a trade data analysis system with efficient data analysis capabilities. Our results indicate that our model does reasonably well and obtains adequate information in deciding international agricultural trade.

177250,Using the ‘Leadership Time Capsule’ to maximise learning in a crisis,2020,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic led to a reorganization of Health Care System for cancer pts, also because of the application of containment measures. The aim of our study was to investigate the emotional discomfort of pts and their CGs who needed to access the day-hospital to receive treatment during pandemic. Methods: This is a single-institution, prospective, cross-sectional study. From 5th May to 5thJune 2020 a survey was conducted at a Department of Oncology in the midst of the Italian outbreak. We compared the points of view of both the 'players' through 2 different multiple-choice questionnaires enquiring demographic characteristics, changes in emotional status, interpersonal relationships with health professionals (HCPs) and self-perception of treatment outcomes. Results: 625 pts and 254 CGs were enrolled. Female were prevalent (pts:65%, CGs:56%). Pts were generally older than CGs (pts:70% &gt; 60 y, CGs:50.4% 41-60 y;p &lt; 0.001). 50.5% pts had a low education level (EL) while 67.5% CGs had a higher degree. About half of pts (52.8%) reached the hospital with their own CG who lived together in the 58.3% of cases. 52.5% of pts felt more vulnerable to COVID-19 compared to CGs. Differently, CGs did not feel more exposed to infection, although they were involved in taking care or lived together with pts. The EL influenced the risk contagion perception: people with a lower EL were less worried about being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Regardless of the perceived contagion risk, study participants considered the containment measures a valid support to avoid the spread of infection (pts:92%, CGs:89%;p = 0.163) without an excessive loss of time (pts:78%, CGs:88.6%;p = 0.003). A personal emotional change caused by waiting and performing visits/treatments alone was reported more by CGs (66%) than by pts (32.7%;p &lt; 0.001). Specifically, CGs had greater anxiety (58.8%) and fear of not properly managing pts at home (19.8%). The majority of pts (73%) and CGs (62%) thought that the pandemic didn't influence treatment outcomes. The relationship with HCPs was not negatively affected for both pts (79.6%) and CGs (95%), but about a quarter of pts (25%) and CGs (29%) thought that the attention of HCPs was more focused on COVID-19 than on cancer treatment. Conclusions: The majority of pts felt at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and therefore approved the application of safety standards to help them feel more protected. Good relationships with HCPs contributed to receive treatments without experiencing additional distress. For CGs the main troubles are limitations which don't allow to fully share the pts' care route and the perceive an impairment in HCPs relationship. Starting from these data, we can better understand the current psychological distress of pts and their families in order to develop potential strategies to support them in this strenuous period of crisis.","Cona, M.

The COVID-19 pandemic, with its complexity and global reach, created unprecedented challenges for public health and highlighted societal vulnerability to hazardous hot weather. In this study, we used data from a three-wave nationally representative survey of 3036 American adults to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected extreme heat vulnerability during the summer of 2020. We used mixed effects models to examine the roles of socio-demographic characteristics and pandemic-related factors in the distribution of negative heat effects and experiences across the United States. The survey findings show that over a quarter of the US population experienced heat-related symptoms during the summer of 2020. Mixed effects models demonstrate that among all socio-economic groups, those who were most vulnerable were women, those in low-income households, unemployed or on furlough, and people who identify as Hispanic or Latino or as other non-white census categories (including Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multi-racial US residents). The study findings indicate that millions of people in the US had difficulty coping with or responding to extreme heat because of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited access to cooling as well as COVID-19 related social isolation played a major role in adverse heat health effects. Geographically, the South and the West of the US stood out in terms of self-reported negative heat effects. Overall, the study suggests that the intersection of two health hazards—extreme heat and coronavirus SARS-CoV2—amplified existing systemic vulnerabilities and expanded the demographic range of people vulnerable to heat stress.","Wilhelmi, O.

178831,ViewpointRuminations on peer review in the time of social change,2021,"Damage in COVID-19 results from both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its triggered overreactive host immune responses. Therapeutic agents that focus solely on reducing viral load or hyperinflammation fail to provide satisfying outcomes in all cases. Although viral and cellular factors have been extensively profiled to identify potential anti-COVID targets, new drugs with significant efficacy remain to be developed. Here, we report the potent preclinical efficacy of ALD-R491, a vimentin-targeting small molecule compound, in treating COVID-19 through its host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions. We found that by altering the physical properties of vimentin filaments, ALD-491 affected general cellular processes as well as specific cellular functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, ALD-R491 reduced endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and exosomal release, thus impeding the entry and egress of the virus; increased the microcidal capacity of macrophages, thus facilitating the pathogen clearance; and enhanced the activity of regulatory T cells, therefore suppressing the overreactive immune responses. In cultured cells, ALD-R491 potently inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2-mediated pseudoviral infection. In aged mice with ongoing, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, ALD-R491 reduced disease symptoms as well as lung damage. In rats, ALD-R491 also reduced bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate a unique mechanism and significant therapeutic potential for ALD-R491 against COVID-19. We anticipate that ALD-R491, an oral, fast-acting, and non-toxic agent targeting the cellular protein with multipart actions, will be convenient, safe, and broadly effective, regardless of viral mutations, for patients with early- or late-stage disease, post-COVID complications and other related diseases. IMPORTANCE With the Delta variant currently fueling a resurgence of new infections in the fully-vaccinated population, developing an effective therapeutic drug is especially critical and urgent in fighting COVID-19. In contrast to the many efforts to repurpose existing drugs or address only one aspect of COVID-19, we are developing a novel agent with first-in-class mechanism-of-actions that address both the viral infection and the overactive immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. Unlike virus-directed therapeutics that may lose efficacy due to viral mutations and immunosuppressants that require ideal timing to be effective, this agent, with its unique host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, can work against all variants of the virus, be effective during all stages of the disease, and even resolve post-disease damage and complications. A further development of the compound will provide an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, its complications, as well as future outbreaks of new viruses.","Li, Zhizhen; Wu, Jianping; Zhou, Ji; Yuan, Baoshi; Chen, Jiqiao; Wu, Wanchen; Mo, Lian; Qu, Zhipeng; Zhou, Fei; Dong, Yingying; Huang, Kai; Liu, Zhiwei; Wang, Tao; Symmes, Deebie; Gu, Jingliang; Sho, Eiketsu; Zhang, Jingping; Chen, Ruihuan; Xu, Ying",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.26.457884,569
179058,Brazilian states in the context of COVID-19 pandemic: an index proposition using Network Data Envelopment Analysis,2021,"In the first trimester 2020, a significant number of countries implemented general lockdowns of their populations to contain the quickly expanding SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and avoid major saturation of health care capacity. Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown. Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it. Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour, but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown. Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected populations behavior, work, risk perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate epidemic dynamics in these conditions.","Bosetti, Paolo; Huynh, Bich-Tram; Abdou, Armiya Youssouf; Sanchez, Marie; Eisenhauer, Catherine; Courtejoie, NoÃ©mie; Accardo, JÃ©rÃ´me; Salje, Henrik; Guillemot, Didier; Moslonka-Lefebvre, Mathieu; BoÃ«lle, Pierre-Yves; BÃ©raud, Guillaume; Cauchemez, Simon; Opatowski, Lulla",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20205104,569

Although, Covid-19 virus imposes detrimental effects to all groups of persons irrespective of their age, sex, race and body physic. Immuno-compromised people are reported to be severely affected in comparison to immunocompetent persons, suggesting immunity as a major player against SARS CoV-2. Despite of great efforts and intensive researches carried all over the world, so far there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for Covid-19. In this regard, different traditional medicinal plants, which are vast reservoir of bioactive compounds with broad therapeutic and immunomodulatory properties, have been emerged as boon to combat with Covid-19. Along with pharmacological properties and easily availability, safety paradigm of ethnomedicinal plants makes them highly preferable immediate remedy to enhance immunity and compete with novel corona virus. Use of traditional Indian spices has been also realized as effective and safer strategy in order to boost immunity and deal with highly terrible current Covid-19 situation. Hence, there is need to boost the efficacy of the traditionally used plant based immunomodulators against Covid-19 pandemic incorporating modern biotechnological and pharmacological tools so as to enhance bioavailability and practical applicability. The present article deals with general feature of SARS CoV-2 along with recent reports on efficacy of traditional medicinal plants as well as Indian spices as an effective immunomodulator for Covid-19.","Shikha, Tiwari Dubey N.

Adults diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are especially vulnerable, due to pre-existing employment challenges, intolerance to changes and uncertainty and high levels of related anxiety.ObjectivesTo examine COVID-19 related changes in work experiences and mental health of employees with ASD who held a steady job before the COVID-19 outbreak.MethodsData were collected from 23 participants diagnosed with ASD (4 females), aged 20–49, who answered an online administered survey at two timepoints: prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and during the outbreak. Self-reports included measures of background and employment status;mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12);job satisfaction (Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire);and satisfaction of psychological needs at work (Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration – Work domain).ResultsParticipants who continued to physically attend work maintained pre-COVID-19 levels on all assessed variables. Participants who transitioned to remote work from home preserved their salary levels and job satisfaction, but showed a marginally significant deterioration in mental health and a significant decrease in the satisfaction of their needs for competence and autonomy at work. Unemployed participants showed a significant decrease in mental health.ConclusionsResults highlight employment as a protective factor from the potential negative implications of COVID-19 on mental-health of employees with ASD. Employees who transition to working from home require personalized work-support plans due to the possible negative effects of this transition on mental health. Maintaining the routine of physically reporting to work should be preferred, when possible.","Goldfarb, Y.; Gal, E.; Golan, O.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.719,569

179350,Human mobility data from the BBC Pandemic project,2021-02-23,"Severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the main causes of COVID-19-related deaths due to their life-threatening complications which often warrant intensive care management to improve patients’ outcomes. We herein, present a case of severe COVID-19 with several critical complications in an Intensive Care Physician misdiagnosed initially for severe malaria and later adequately diagnosed and managed successfully at Douala General Hospital in Cameroon. We report a case of a 35-year-old obese African Anaesthesiologist and Intensive Care Physician with a recent history of exposure to COVID-19 patients who presented to the emergency department with signs, symptoms and laboratory test suggestive of severe malaria. He had no remission with parenteral anti-malarial drugs. Within some few days he developed pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, septic shock, acute kidney injury and mild hepatocellur lysis and had a positive reverse time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to COVID-19. His outcome was uneventful within five days of intensive care management and close monitoring. The case pinpoints the common practice of misdiagnosing COVID-19 for severe malaria especially in patients without respiratory symptoms in our malaria endemic zone. This often leads to late diagnoses of COVID-19 with several potentially life-threatening complications which may lead to a fatal outcome of the patient if not managed appropriately. Hence, a high index of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 remains paramount especially for those with COVID-19 risk factors such recent exposure to COVID-19 patient and obesity. © Journal of Xiangya Medicine.

179769,The frugal life and why we should educate for it,2021,"Information and communication technology (ICT) is a combination stressing the important role in the prevention of COVID-19 in Vietnam. This article shows that the communication has greatly contributed towards the success of anti-pandemic propaganda campaign encouraging the spread of message “Fighting the pandemic is like fighting against the enemy” and getting enthusiastic response nationwide. Additionally, a wide variety of applications for warning and detecting new cases has been created. Information technology also has great significance for digital transformation in some public services that previously required the direct participation and contact of the people, thereby helping alleviate the risk of infection with corona virus. However, certain negative impacts of a strong and drastic propaganda strategy of the media on people’s psychology are readily visible. At the same time, any low efficiency of ICT applications for digitizing public services and detecting new cases is another constraint that needs improvement if Vietnam desires to maintain a good performance in the fight against COVID-19 as in the first stage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Le Thy Thuong, N.; Thuy, T.

Experts across many different fields contributed their time and efforts in different ways to respond to the pandemic. Psychologists working in healthcare provided support and led many initiatives, both regionally and nationally.

Aim: The current study is a survey of European member associations of EFPA, carried out to understand the current contributions and the impact those psychology contributions have had on the COVID-19 pandemic response, to share lessons learned, and to propose a roadmap for the future. Results: Overall, our study highlights how psychological expertise was integrated into many countries' policy/decision-making, action-planning, caregiving, and the promotion of health and well-being to health professionals and the general public. Even in places where psychologists were not directly integrated into governmental systems, they played an important role in responding to this pandemic by providing their services and empirical knowledge. Discussion: Many psychologists possess the skills and tools to adapt their practice to the digital provision of services and to provide a continuity of care during the pandemic. Research carried out by psychologists has contributed important and new knowledge on pandemic effects, consequences, and interventions;yet, more research financial support is needed. We make recommendations for augmenting psychologists' contributions in the future.

Especially with the covid-19 pandemic, most of the office workers are forced to switch to work from home within a short period of time. This is no longer a temporary change but will be a huge change affecting our lives now and in the future. This research is based on human-centered design, at the very first part we do a widely-interview with people who work in different industries, the problems are not only mental health but also come from user’s inner worlds, so we narrow down to make a deeper interview to our target user, digital nomads, the one who derives income remotely and online, rather than from commuting to an office. After it, we made the persona and user journey to find out the touchpoint, to define our problem more specifically, there’re three main points (1) it is flexible but too fragmented at home, (2) inefficient working schedule, and (3) loss of connection to working partners. In addition, behavior change takes a big part here, which means when we find the right mode of working at home and persist on the basis of having a considerable level of satisfaction, it will become the new normal in the future. We come out with a conceptual application combining with smart home technology named Groovy, aims to let the user (1) reduce decision making time, the application will tell you what time is best for what to do, (2) observe and suggest better schedules for you, based on your working habits, and (3) reduce the feeling of loneliness.

In today's era, people across all ages are spending a lot of time in front of these devices. This also implies a surge in Digital Eye Strain cases, which is one of the emerging health issues. Researchers have linked this problem with symptoms such as dry eyes, altered blinking pattern, visual fatigue etc. Although the previous studies on facial features have already focused on blinking patterns, yawn detection and head movement, the proposed research work has concluded that other facial gestures comprising droopy eyes and decrease in glabellar length are also relevant features for this study to increase the accuracy. This paper tries to effectively detect when a user is under strain so that he or she can take timely precautions. A supervised method based on statistical features linked to suggested symptoms is proposed for classifying videos recorded in real time as user under strain using SVM.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons.

181556,"An infographic in an ‘infodemic’ – communication in a global pandemic with simplicity, design and speed",2021,"During the brief coronavirus-induced hiatus in March and April 2020, educational institutions in Bangladesh including public universities began preparations for online classes. By the end of June, almost all private universities and a few public universities had started online classes with limited or no preparation, which was met with appreciation as well as censure from different stakeholders. Against this backdrop, this study was conducted with a view to examining the online teaching-learning scenario at Bangladeshi public universities from the perspective of one important stakeholder, the students, with a specific focus on the challenges they faced with this new mode of instruction. Suggestions were also sought from them regarding how the barriers to online instruction could be overcome. Data were collected from 26 students of English Departments of 11 public universities through semi-structured interviews. The major challenges reported include issues of access and equity, inadequate logistic support and poor infrastructure. Concerns related to curriculum, pedagogy, assessment and psychological issues were also highlighted. In addition, lack of prior experience and inadequate training were identified as serious obstacles. Major suggestions from the participants include ensuring access and equity, providing training opportunities and digital devices to students, and engaging in curriculum and assessment reforms. © 2020.

181588,Your leadership style: why understanding yourself matters,2020,"IntroductionIn the context of COVID-19 pandemic, first-line responders (FLR) are exposed to multiple stress factors, ranging from lack of adequate protective equipment to worries about family health due to work-related exposure to the new coronavirus. Therefore, FLR became themselves a vulnerable population that need prevention strategies for professional stress-related disorders (PSRD).ObjectivesTo explore the literature in order to find evidence-based prevention strategies for PSRD in FLR, strategies resulted from other epidemiological crisis situations (MERS-CoV, H1N1, SARS-CoV) that may be applied in the current pandemic.MethodsA literature review was performed through the main electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, EMBASE) using the search paradigm “professional stress-related disorders” AND “first line responders” AND “prevention”. All papers published between January 2000 and June 2020 were included.ResultsReported prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in FLR involved in epidemiological crises was between 10% and 33%. Evidence-based recommendations for PSRD prevention are lacking, and only general advices have been detected. These suggestions were clustered on institutional level (e.g., involving of medical personnel in administrative decisions, encouraging personal initiatives, longer pauses between shifts) and individual level (e.g., training of coping abilities, relaxation techniques, and peer-focused group support). Several guidelines for prevention of mental disorders in workplace exist, but they are not focused on FLR.ConclusionsThe need to elaborate guidelines for prevention of PSRD in FLR can not be overemphasized, especially in the pandemic period, in order to avoid the onset of stress-related complications, and to preserve a good quality of the medical activity.","Vasiliu, O.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1219,569
181590,"Getting out of crises: Environmental, social-ecological and evolutionary research is needed to avoid future risks of pandemics",2022-01-31,"Aquatic macroinvertebrates play a crucial role in freshwater ecosystems, but their diversity remains poorly known, particularly in the tropics. This “taxonomic void” represents limits our understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes in freshwater ecosystems, and the scale at which they operate. We used DNA barcoding to estimate lineage diversity (and the diversity of unique haplotypes) in 224 specimens of freshwater macroinvertebrates at a small spatial scale within the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW). In addition, we compiled available barcoding data to assess macroinvertebrate diversity at a broader spatial scale spanning the Isthmus of Panama. Consistently across two species delimitation algorithms (i.e., ABGD and GMYC), we found high lineage diversity within the PCW, with ~ 100-106 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs at 2% sequence divergence) across 168 unique haplotypes. We also found a high lineage diversity along the Isthmus of Panama, but this diversity peaked within the PCW. However, our rarefaction/extrapolation approach showed that this diversity remains under sampled. As expected, these results indicate that the diversity of Neotropical freshwater macroinvertebrates is higher than previously thought, with the possibility of high endemicity even at narrow spatial scales. Geographic isolation is likely a main factor shaping these patterns of diversity. However, local disturbances such as the rupture of the continental divide due to the construction of the Panama Canal might be reshaping these patterns of diversity at a local scale. Although further work is needed to better understand the processes driving diversification in freshwater macroinvertebrates, we suggest that Neotropical streams represent continental islands of diversity. Understanding these islands of diversity is crucial in the face of increasing human disturbance.","De León, Luis F.; Cornejo, Aydeé; Gavilán, Ronnie G.; Aguilar, Celestino",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.018457,569
181637,Viewpoint: The co-evolution of knowledge management and business model transformation in the post-COVID-19 era: insights based on Chinese e-commerce companies,2021,"Background: Despite rigorous disinfection, fumigation and air treatment, infectious microbial load has been found to circulate and survive for significant duration in health care settings. This raises significant concerns for hospital acquired infections. We have developed a novel, hybrid, trap-and-kill airborne-microbicidal technology called ZeBox which is efficient in clearing 99.999% of airborne microbial load under controlled lab conditions. In this study we evaluate the clinical performance of the ZeBox in reducing airborne and surface microbial load in two independent hospital settings. Methods: The studies were conducted in single bed and multi bed ICU of two hospitals. Airborne and surface microbial loads were collected at pre-determined sampling sites pre- and post-deployment of the ZeBox enabled device. The Normality of data distribution was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was determined using Students T test and Mann-Whitneys U test. Pathogenic and opportunistic organisms were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing. Furthermore, the antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated organisms was tested against current treatments of choice across major antibiotic classes. Results: Post-deployment, we found statistically significant reductions in both airborne and surface microbial load within the operating range of the ZeBox enabled technology . Across the both hospital ICUs, there was 90% reduction of airborne microbial load on average, and 75% reduction of surface microbial load on average, providing a low bioburden zone of roughly 10-15 feet diameter around the unit. These reduced microbial levels were maintained during the entire duration of device operation over several weeks. Many of the clinical isolates recovered from one of the hospitals were drug resistant, which highlighted the potential ability of ZeBox to eliminate drug-resistant microbes and thereby reduce the frequency of hospital acquired infections. Conclusions: ZeBox enabled technology can significantly reduce a broad spectrum of microbial burden in air and on surfaces in clinical settings. It can thereby serve an unmet need in reducing the incidence of hospital acquired infections.","Nagaraj, S.; Chandrasingh, S.; Jose, S.; B, S.; Sampath, S.; Krishna, B.; Menon, I.; Kundu, D.; Parekh, S.; Madival, D.; Nandi, V.; Ghatak, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262596v1?rss=1,569
181647,Technological Innovation and Circular Economy Practices: Business Strategies to Mitigate the Effects of COVID-19,2021,"Bugs in learners' programs are often the result of fundamental misconceptions. Teachers frequently face the challenge of first having to understand such bugs, and then suggest ways to fix them. In order to enable teachers to do so effectively and efficiently, it is desirable to support them in recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns of similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of hints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in debugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in training, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on bug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can reduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while increasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions. While this improvement is convincing, arguably teachers in training might first need to learn debugging""the hard way""to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying on tools. We therefore investigate whether the use of hints during training affects their ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment provides no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or learning to debug""the hard way""leads to better learning effects. Overall, this suggests that bug patterns might be a useful concept to include in the curriculum for teachers in training, while tool-support to recognise these patterns is desirable for teachers in practice.","Greifenstein, Luisa; Obermuller, Florian; Wasmeier, Ewald; Heuer, Ute; Fraser, Gordon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07052v1.pdf,569

Food safety has been hit the hardest in the COVID-19 era. The aim of this paper was to investigate the attitudes and hygienic practices and food handling during social isolation by COVID-19 in Peruvian homes. A cross-sectional study was conducted that included 538 participants over 18 years of age from all regions of Peru, administering an online survey of 15 questions. The sample was selected by nonprobability sampling for convenience. The data were analysed using the statistical software IBM SPSS version 24 and the Chi-square test was used. A significance level of 5% was considered. Women represented the highest percentage of the sample (73.0%). 87.7% of the participants considered correct handling of food at home important during social isolation. Whereas 49.7% of the sample reported that they began to emphasize good handling practices when the COVID-19 pandemic began. Hand washing practices were more frequent in participants with a higher level of education (p&lt;0.001).

The aim of the paper is to chart the complex process of the belated response of Brussels to the pandemic in the light of the concept of resilience of the Union, examining in detail the reasons for taken measures and its consequences for its future development, defining future scenarios. On the basis of the analysis, it is concluded that in modern conditions, resilience from an external category has gradually become internal for the EU. Moreover, this is relevant for the EU development in the context of today's COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges to European unity that it has caused. The authors review the key measures taken by EU institutions and bodies to combat the pandemic and provide economic assistance to member states to overcome its negative consequences. Based on the analysis carried out, three scenarios for the further development of the EU are proposed, and an opinion is expressed on the need to further ensure the resilience of the Union itself. Since, in any case, the pandemic has demonstrated that the era of nation states in the region is finally a thing of the past, and Europe needs much greater unity and cohesion.","Entin, M.; Galushko, D.",Eastern Journal of European Studies,https://doi.org/10.47743/ejes-2021-si10,569

182190,A Case Study on using Unstructured Data Analysis Methods to identify local Covid-19 Hotspots,2021,"Background: Supportive care is considered essential to standard care for patients with a history of cancer. The interdisciplinary team at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) of Thomas Jefferson University, an NCI-designated cancer center in Philadelphia, offers a robust variety of supportive care services including support groups, educational and wellness programs. SKCC includes four academic hubs across the Greater Philadelphia region. With the onset of the COVID- 19 pandemic and the subsequent statewide shutdown of services, SKCC quickly pivoted to virtual offerings, to address patients' supportive care needs. Recent research has shown patients self-reporting higher incidence of anxiety and loneliness due to the pandemic. Direct patient feedback identified programs of greatest need, the preferred times and format. Methods: At the beginning of the pandemic SKCC offered a program 'Coping with Cancer and Covid-19: as You Navigate Cancer Treatment.' This program helped patients understand their risk of COVID-19 and provided emotional support as patients and caregivers began facing loneliness. Additional virtual offerings included Mindfulness Sessions, Yoga, Stretching for Stress Relief, Healing through Humor. SKCC began evaluating the impact of the programming beginning in June 2020. Attendees completed surveys evaluating the presentation, their level of psychological distress, perceived quality of life, and feelings of hope, loneliness, and connection. Participants were asked if they would attend another program and were asked to rate the program on a Likert scale. Results: In 2019 SKCC offered 273 programs and attracted 984 participants. Only 90 of the 984 participants attended virtually prior to the pandemic. Since the start of the pandemic, SKCC has hosted 334 programs, all virtually, with 3,346 participants. Surveys were sent electronically and completed immediately after the completion of all support programs offered at SKCC. 40% of program participants' completed an evaluation form and 94% rated the program exceptional or very good. Overall, 88% of participants in virtual wellness, support groups and educational programs indicated they would attend another program offered by SKCC. Conclusions: Virtual supportive care offerings have engaged more patients and caregivers than ever across SKCC hubs and have proven an effective means to continue to support patients during the pandemic. It is important to continue to evaluate and create meaningful programs to match the ongoing needs of patients and caregivers.","Capparella, L.; Lopez, A. M.; Naputo, K.; O039,; Hayer, C. V.

Study Design and Setting We evaluated risk of bias (ROB) on 102 CPMs from the Tufts CPM Registry, comparing PROBAST to a short form consisting of six PROBAST items anticipated to best identify high ROB. We then applied the short form to all CPMs in the Registry with at least 1 validation and assessed the change in discrimination (dAUC) between the derivation and the validation cohorts (n=1,147). Results PROBAST classified 98/102 CPMS as high ROB. The short form identified 96 of these 98 as high ROB (98% sensitivity), with perfect specificity. In the full CPM registry, 529/556 CPMs (95%) were classified as high ROB, 20 (4%) low ROB, and 7 (1%) unclear ROB. Median change in discrimination was significantly smaller in low ROB models (dAUC -0.9%, IQR -6.2% &- -4.2%) compared to high ROB models (dAUC -11.7%, IQR -33.3% &- 2.6%; p<0.001). Conclusion High ROB is pervasive among published CPMs. It is associated with poor performance at validation, supporting the application of PROBAST or a shorter version in CPM reviews.","Vemena, E.; Wessler, B.

In one review of DKA and COVID-19 in adults, 77% had pre-existing diabetes while 10% were newly diagnosed. We report an adolescent with severe DKA and new onset T2D in the setting of COVID-19 infection, who had a complex hospital course. Case: A 14-year old male with BMI of 43.7 kg/m2 and learning disabilities presented with decreased mental status and 4 day history of polydipsia, polyuria and emesis. Initial labs: glucose 546 mg/dl, BOHB 4.4 mmol/L, venous pH 6.94, HCO3 3mmol/L, serum osm 287 mOsm/kg, A1C 12.3%, pancreatic antibodies negative. C-reactive protein, d-dimer, ferritin, CPK, troponin, lipase (4,610 U/L), and amylase (839 U/L) were elevated. Patient received mannitol. No cerebral edema on head CT. Chest/Abd CT showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation of lungs and heterogeneous pancreas with no fluid collection. IV fluids and insulin were started. Nine hours after presentation, mental status declined further and patient required intubation for respiratory failure. At 19 hours, ketosis had resolved but acidosis persisted with arterial pH=7.05. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was positive. Course was complicated by multi-organ failure, rhabdomyolysis, and fluid refractory shock requiring vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (max creatinine 5.13 mg/dL).

While most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content may influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset. Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 days. The effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. 940 patients were randomized and 921 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) in the standard of care arm; relative risk (RR) 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43; p=0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 26.4%; RR=1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.57, p=0.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standard log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (OR=0.74; 0.57-0.95 and OR=0.66; 0.50-0.87, respectively), while IgG against the full transmembrane Spike protein increased it (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.05). Convalescent plasma did not reduce the risk of intubation or death at 30 days among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with unfavourable antibody profiles may be associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to standard care.","Begin, P.; Callum, J.; Jamula, E.

All sows were TGE antibody seronegative prior to inoculation except for one naturally infected sow inoculated during lactation. The animal injected during pregnancy had primarily IgG TGE antibodies in milk from all glands. By contrast, sows injected during lactation had IgA and IgM initially, and later IgA and IgG TGE antibodies in milk from injected and noninjected glands. The seropositive sow had elevated IgA TGE antibody titers in milk after IMm injection. Both seronegative sows inoculated intramammarily during lactation shed TGE virus in milk from injected glands, and their nursing piglets developed mild diarrhea and shed virus in their feces at three to nine DPE of the sows. Milk from IMm injected glands generally had higher TGE antibody titers than milk from noninjected glands. These results suggest that TGE virus replicates in lactating mammary gland tissue, thereby stimulating IgA immunocytes, leading to secretion of IgA antibodies in milk. Whether the intramammary route presents a natural route of enteric virus exposure in lactating animals (by way of infected nursing piglets), leading to IgA-antibody secretion in milk, requires further investigation.","Saif, L J; Bohl, E H",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6575719/,569

Individual reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions were performed to detect infection with picornaviruses (rhinoviruses and enteroviruses), coronaviruses (serotypes OC43 and 229E), adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses (types A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS Picornaviruses were the most frequently detected pathogen identified in 46% (56 of 123) of episodes, followed by RSV (27%), parainfluenza viruses (13%) and coronaviruses (9%). Dual pathogen infections were identified in 20% of episodes, predominantly caused by picornaviruses together with either RSV or parainfluenza viruses. RSV infection was significantly associated with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. No other associations were found between pathogen and clinical diagnosis. Dual infection did not predispose infants to a more severe clinical course. CONCLUSIONS Picornaviruses are the predominant cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the first year of life. Large prospective community-based studies will be needed to fully evaluate the contribution of picornaviruses, both in isolation and in combination with other respiratory pathogens, to the various clinical syndromes of respiratory infection observed during infancy.","Legg, Julian P; Warner, Jill A; Johnston, Sebastian L; Warner, John O",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15999002/,569

Cardiology's viewpoint in times of coronavirus pandemic].,2020,"We have constructed chimaeric (ch) mouse/human antibodies with identical binding regions isolated from the V-genes of two mouse parent hybridoma cell lines, with specificity against the P1.7 and P1.16 epitopes on the outer-membrane protein PorA on meningococci. The chimaeric antibodies can be used to analyse relationships between specificity, binding activity (avidity and kinetics), isotype (antibody class and antibody subclass) and in vitro anti-bacterial activity of meningococcal antibodies. The antibody sets represented the human isotypes IgG1, IgG3 and IgM, which dominate during immune response against protein antigens. The binding activities were quite similar for all these isotypes, surprisingly also for the pentameric IgM. Interestingly, monomeric IgM, prepared from pentameric IgM by partially reduction and alkylation, had similar binding activities as the original pentameric IgM. Regarding in vitro anti-bacterial activity, chIgG1 was superior in SBA (serum bactericidal activity) compared with chIgG3, while chIgG3 was more efficient in OP (opsonophagocytosis; measured by flow cytometry) than chIgG1. ChIgM showed slightly higher SBA than chIgG1 on molar basis, and much higher OP than chIgG3 and chIgG1. A lower concentration of antibodies was needed against the P1.16 than against the P1.7 epitope to induce SBA, but this was not the case for OP.","Michaelsen, T E; Ihle, Ø; Beckstrøm, K J; Herstad, T K; Sandin, R H; Kolberg, J; Aase, A",Biochemical Society transactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14505474/,569

A major tool of synthetic biology is artificial gene synthesis, which provides a direct means from a conceptualized DNA sequence to the corresponding physical DNA for the construction of a variety of biological components. To date, synthetic biology has often been used to answer fundamental questions in basic research, but now is poised to greatly enhance translational research. In this review, we discuss several translational applications of synthetic biology including the construction of novel diagnostics and vaccines, development of new synthetic pathways for drug screening and biosynthesis, and the creation of engineered viruses and microbes to fight human disease. Together these and other novel translational applications of artificial gene synthesis and synthetic biology have the opportunity to make major advances for improving human health.","Burbelo, Peter D; Ching, Kathryn H; Han, Brian L; Klimavicz, Caitlin M; Iadarola, Michael J",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20733948/,569

199285,Exploring Factors of Mobile Device Adoption in Nursing Education,2021,"BACKGROUND Although conventional pain relief therapeutics have centered around mu-opioid agonists, these drugs are limited by adverse side effects, including respiratory depression and addiction potential. The ongoing opioid epidemic has galvanized research into novel analgesic therapies with more favorable profiles. New pharmacologic agents have been developed to target neuronal pathways involved in pain sensation. Certain receptors have been recognized to mediate nociceptive transmission, central sensitization, and the development of chronic pain states. OBJECTIVES We conducted a literature review to identify potential targets for novel analgesic therapies. STUDY DESIGN This study is a narrative review of potential analgesic targets. We characterize their antinociceptive mechanisms of action and evaluate their therapeutic potential. METHODS A systemized search of available literature on novel analgesics was performed. A search was performed through the PubMed database to identify articles with key words of ""novel analgesics,"" ""novel non-opioid analgesics,"" ""novel pain targets,"" and ""non-opioid analgesics."" Potential drug classes were identified and researched through corresponding keywords, with an emphasis on publications from 2018 to 2020. Older articles were included if frequently referenced by current literature. RESULTS Potential novel analgesic targets include Nav1.7, Nav1.8, CaV2.2, and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) cation channel receptors in the peripheral nervous system. Other approaches disrupt the synthesis of pronociceptive signaling molecules such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Within central pain pathways, modification of kappa-opioid, delta-opioid, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and cannabinoid receptors have been investigated in chronic pain and hyperalgesia models. Recent advances in molecular technology have also presented opportunities to modify protein expression or the cellular genome altogether. LIMITATIONS Several analgesic targets have only demonstrated efficacy in preclinical trials. There are limited data evaluating the long-term safety profiles of therapies further on in development. CONCLUSIONS We provide an overview of potential analgesic therapies in various stages of development, which may become clinically relevant in the near future. Some drugs such as TRPV1 agonists, anti-IL-6, and anti-nerve growth factor antibodies have demonstrated analgesic effect in specific clinical pain states.","Chen, Rosalyn; Coppes, O J Michael; Urman, Richard D",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740349/,569

The ensuing surveillance continued for 3 to 5 years, and in 1991 the results obtained by all laboratories that tested 300 or more fecal specimens were reviewed at a workshop held in Belém. These results showed that rotavirus had been detected in 13% to 20% of the specimens tested, with positive specimens appearing to peak in the May to September ""winter"" or dry season in Brazil's central and southern states but not in the more tropical northern areas. Adenovirus, detected in 0.7% to 5.5% of the specimens tested for it, showed no seasonal variations. Many other viral agents known to cause gastroenteritis (e.g., astrovirus, small round-structured viruses, calcivirus, and group C rotavirus) were detected at centers that used electron microscopy. Picobirnavirus, a novel agent not yet associated with gastroenteritis in humans, was found by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in specimens from a number of centers using this technique. Vaccines to prevent rotavirus that are currently under development would be of great use in Brazil, where rotavirus is the most common cause of childhood diarrhea. Improved diagnostics will be required to assess the importance of the other viral agents.","Pereira, H G; Linhares, A C; Candeias, J A; Glass, R I",Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8220517/,569

It was thought that coronavirus virions were composed of three major viral structural proteins until investigations of other coronaviruses showed that the virions also include viral non-structural and genus-specific accessory proteins as well as host-cell proteins. To study the proteome of IBV virions, virus was grown in embryonated chicken eggs, purified by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation and analysed by mass spectrometry. Analysis of three preparations of purified IBV yielded the three expected structural proteins plus 35 additional virion-associated host proteins. The virion-associated host proteins had a diverse range of functional attributions, being involved in cytoskeleton formation, RNA binding and protein folding pathways. Some of these proteins were unique to this study, while others were found to be orthologous to proteins identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virions and also virions from a number of other RNA and DNA viruses.","Dent, Stuart D; Xia, Dong; Wastling, Jonathan M; Neuman, Benjamin W; Britton, Paul; Maier, Helena J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257648/,569

But concerns over port-incisional hernias have not been addressed.Methods: Between February 2009 and February 2011, 142 patients referred for gallstones who agreed to undergo SILC were included in a monocenter prospective observational study. All of the procedures were carried out using a single-port access technique. The occurrence rates of incisional hernias were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.Results: A total of 142 patients with gallbladder pathology were included in the study; 138 of them underwent SILC and 4 were converted to standard multiport cholecystectomy. Twelve patients (8%) were found to have developed a port-site incisional hernia (PSH) by physical examination or by imaging. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the rate of PSH development was 83% in the first two years after surgery. After two years, this risk becomes quite low.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the SILC procedure is a safe option for treatment of benign gallbladder diseases for selected patients, albeit with a high incisional hernia rate.","Valcarenghi, Jérôme; Hernigou, Jacques; Apicella, Giulia; Clegg, Emilie; Rousie, Maxime; Chasse, Emmanuel",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375576/,569

Changes in HIV- and STD-related risk behaviors among high school students in the United States during 1991-2005 were reported previously. To update these analyses through 2007, CDC analyzed data from nine biennial national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 1991-2007, the percentage of U.S. high school students who ever had sexual intercourse decreased 12%, the percentage who had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their lifetime decreased 20%, and the percentage who were currently sexually active decreased 7%. Among students who were currently sexually active, the prevalence of condom use increased 33%. However, these changes in risk behaviors were not observed in some subgroups. In addition, no changes were detected in the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors from 2005 to 2007, and many students still engaged in behaviors that place them at risk for HIV infection and STDs.

200786,Failure to achieve global vaccine equity will have dire consequences,2021,"In 2001, suicide was the third leading cause of death among persons aged 10-19 years. The most common method of suicide in this age group was by firearm (49%), followed by suffocation (mostly hanging) (38%) and poisoning (7%). During 1992-2001, although the overall suicide rate among persons aged 10-19 years declined from 6.2 to 4.6 per 100,000 population, methods of suicide changed substantially. To characterize trends in suicide methods among persons in this age group, CDC analyzed data for persons living in the United States during 1992-2001. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated a substantial decline in suicides by firearm and an increase in suicides by suffocation in persons aged 10-14 and 15-19 years. Beginning in 1997, among persons aged 10-14 years, suffocation surpassed firearms as the most common suicide method.

201009,"Characterization of the aerosol chemical composition during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Suzhou in the Yangtze River Delta, China",2020,"BACKGROUND The recent newly appeared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by an enveloped RNA virus named ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"", is associated with severe respiratory morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that lymphopenia and a cytokine mass release represent important pathogenic features, with clinical evidence of dyspnea and hypoxemia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in severely ill patients, with a high death toll. Currently, stem cells are actively being investigated for their potential use in many ""untreatable"" diseases. In this regard and in particular, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), due to their intrinsic features, including either ability to impact on regulation of the immune system, or association with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, or potential for differentiation into several cell lineages, have become a promising tool for cell and molecular-based therapies. On this background, we wished to explore whether human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMS) would represent a potential viable therapeutic approach for the management of critically ill COVID19 patients. METHODS We tested the hUCMS effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) retrieved from patients with COVID19 (Ethical Committee CEAS Umbria, Italy CER N°3658/20 7, May, 2020), both as free cell monolayers and after envelopment in sodium alginate microcapsules. Both cell systems, after priming with IFN-γ, proved able to produce several immunomodulatory molecules such as IDO1 and HLAG5, although only the microencapsulated hUCMS were associated with massive and dose-dependent production of these factors. RESULTS The microencapsulated hUCMS improved allo-suppression in mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLRs), while also blunting T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses, that are involved with the cytokine storm and greatly contribute to the patient death. Moreover, we observed that both free and microencapsulated hUCMS permitted 5 days survival of in vitro culture maintained PBMCs extracted from very ill patients. CONCLUSION We have provided evidence that microencapsulated hUCMS in vitro, seem to represent a powerful tool to impact on several immune pathways, clearly deranged in COVID19 patients. Further study is necessary to begin in vivo assessment of this experimental system, upon determining both, the most appropriate time of the disease onset for intervention, and cell dosage/patient of our experimental product.","Montanucci, Pia; Pescara, Teresa; Greco, Alessia; Francisci, Daniela; Basta, Giuseppe; Calafiore, Riccardo",American journal of stem cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552816/,569

The C-terminal ORF1a protein nsp10 colocalizes with viral replication complexes, but its role in transcription/replication is not well defined. To investigate the role of nsp10 in coronavirus transcription/replication, alanine replacements were engineered into a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infectious clone in place of conserved residues in predicted functional domains or charged amino acid pairs/triplets, and rescued viruses were analyzed for mutant phenotypes. Of the 16 engineered clones, 5 viable viruses were rescued, 3 mutant viruses generated no cytopathic effect but were competent to synthesize viral subgenomic RNAs, and 8 were not viable. All viable mutants showed reductions in growth kinetics and overall viral RNA synthesis, implicating nsp10 as being a cofactor in positive- or negative-strand synthesis. Viable mutant nsp10-E2 was compromised in its ability to process the nascent polyprotein, as processing intermediates were detected in cells infected with this virus that were not detectable in wild-type infections. Mapping the mutations onto the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus nsp10 identified a central core resistant to mutation. Mutations targeting residues in or near either zinc-binding finger generated nonviable phenotypes, demonstrating that both domains are essential to nsp10 function and MHV replication. All mutations resulting in viable phenotypes mapped to loops outside the central core and were characterized by a global decrease in RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that nsp10 is a critical regulator of coronavirus RNA synthesis and may play an important role in polyprotein processing.","Donaldson, Eric F; Sims, Amy C; Graham, Rachel L; Denison, Mark R; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17392363/,569

TTS may be triggered by several physical and emotional stressors. The name Covidsubo was recently adopted to describe this emerging entity. TTS during quarantine may be a reasonable outcome of the overwhelming stress and fear of this pandemic. However, according to the current literature, conflicting results have been reported regarding the incidence of this syndrome during the first wave of the pandemic, and further studies are needed. High index of suspicion is needed to identify patients during the next waves of the pandemic, particularly given the need for minimizing imaging modalities and contact with the patients. OBJECTIVES To describe two cases of TTS triggered by quarantine during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS Two patients (age 81 years and 70 years) were admitted to our medical center with severe chest pain with normal blood pressure and heart rate. RESULTS TTS should always be in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain suspected to be from coronary origin. Based on the typical clinical, echocardiographic, and angiographic findings, we assumed TTS.

This disease is one of the most prevalent and serious clinical syndromes seen around the world, especially in children. Rotaviruses, in the family Reoviridae, and fastidious fecal adenoviruses account for much of the viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children, whereas the small caliciviruses and unclassified astroviruses, and possibly enteric coronaviruses, are responsible for significantly fewer cases overall. In addition to electron microscopy, enzyme immunoassays and other rapid antigen detection systems have been developed to detect rotaviruses and fastidious fecal adenoviruses in the stool specimens of both nonhospitalized patients and those hospitalized for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Experimental rotavirus vaccines have also been developed, due to the prevalence and seriousness of rotavirus infection. The small, unclassified Norwalk virus and morphologically similar viruses are responsible for large and small outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in older children, adolescents, and adults.

204498,Resilience in action: leading for resilience in response to COVID-19,2020,"Currently most researchers consider humanity's extermination of biodiversity as the antecedent of ideal conditions for the emergence of new viruses and diseases. Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour. The message is simple: we need to rethink our current relationship with nature and with ourselves, which should lead to a social transformation towards the sustainable use of the available resources.","Lorenz, Camila; de Oliveira Lage, Mariana; Chiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco",Sci Total Environ,,569
204691,Risk Management amidst Covid-19 by Pakistani Universities: a Study of University of the Punjab,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is widespread concern that disruption to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to declines in immunization coverage among young children, but there is limited information on the magnitude of such impact. High immunization coverage is essential for reducing the risk of vaccine preventable diseases. METHODS: We used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. RESULTS: SIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities.","Silveira, Mariangela F; Tonial, Cristian T; Goretti K Maranhão, Ana; Teixeira, Antonia M S; Hallal, Pedro C; Maria B Menezes, Ana; Horta, Bernardo L; Hartwig, Fernando P; Barros, Aluisio J D; Victora, Cesar G",Vaccine,,569

The odds of having &#8805;3 medical conditions were greater for Black immigrants (OR=1.79, 95% CI=1.13, 2.82), South Asian immigrants (OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.02, 2.19) and close to double for Aboriginal Canadians (OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.37, 2.80) relative to Canadian-born Whites. Black, South Asian and Aboriginal populations from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds had the highest odds of having &#8805;3 medical conditions (OR=3.50, 95% CI=1.41, 8.70). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Despite a universal health system, marginalized older Canadians who are racialized foreign-born, less educated, and/or low-income have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity that are associated with COVID-19 severe illness and mortality. Upstream health policy and social care tackling intersecting structural inequities should be undertaken to prevent increasing multimorbidity among underserved aging populations.","Lin, Shen Lamson",GerontologistGerontologist,,569

This norm is increasingly problematic during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic when effective infection control measures are of paramount importance. This study investigates the barriers existing before COVID-19 that prevent junior doctors with an acute respiratory illness working in Canberra, Australia, from taking sick leave, and offers suggestions about how to make sick leave more accessible for junior doctors. METHODS: Anonymous online survey study. RESULTS: 192 junior doctors were invited to participate in the study. Fifty-four responded, and only those who had worked whilst unwell with an acute respiratory illness were included, providing a total number of fifty responses. Of these, 72% believed they were infectious at the time they worked whilst unwell. 86% of respondents did not feel supported by the workplace to take sick leave when they were unwell, and 96% identified concerns about burdening colleagues with extra workload and lack of available cover as the main deterrents to accessing sick leave. CONCLUSION: Junior doctors at our health service, pre-COVID-19, do not widely feel empowered to take sick leave when they have an acute respiratory illness. Junior doctors are primarily concerned about burdening their colleagues with extra workloads in an environment where they perceive there to be a lack of available cover. Having more available cover, leadership from seniors, and clearer guidelines around the impact of sick leave on registration may contribute to a culture where junior doctors feel supported to access sick leave.","Mitchell, Lucy; Coatsworth, Nicholas",Infect.

Some recent DNN-based multi-view approaches can perform either bilateral or ipsilateral analysis, while in practice, radiologists use both to achieve the best clinical outcome. MommiNet is the first DNN-based tri-view mass identification approach, which can simultaneously perform bilateral and ipsilateral analysis of mammographic images, and in turn, can fully emulate the radiologists' reading practice. In this paper, we present MommiNet-v2, with improved network architecture and performance. Novel high-resolution network (HRNet)-based architectures are proposed to learn the symmetry and geometry constraints, to fully aggregate the information from all views for accurate mass detection. A multi-task learning scheme is adopted to incorporate both Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and biopsy information to train a mass malignancy classification network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the public DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) dataset and our in-house dataset, and state-of-the-art results have been achieved in terms of mass detection accuracy. Satisfactory mass malignancy classification result has also been obtained on our in-house dataset.","Yang, Zhicheng; Cao, Zhenjie; Zhang, Yanbo; Tang, Yuxing; Lin, Xiaohui; Ouyang, Rushan; Wu, Mingxiang; Han, Mei; Xiao, Jing; Huang, Lingyun; Wu, Shibin; Chang, Peng; Ma, Jie",Med Image Anal,,569

Here, we report the analysis of 864 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from cases in the New York City metropolitan area during the COVID-19 outbreak in spring 2020. The majority of cases had no recent travel history or known exposure, and genetically linked cases were spread throughout the region.

However, studies regarding the effects of vitamin D on COVID-19 patients are still inconsistent. This study aimed to analyze vitamin D supplementation's effect on the severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 patients. Search was conducted in seven databases on September 2020. Studies assessing the topic were included without study design restrictions. Four studies were included in this study. All reported risk of mortality, and three reported of severity degree. Two of the three found patients with vitamin D supplementation had a significantly lower risk of disease. One other found no significant difference, although a higher proportion of severe COVID-19 was recorded in the group without supplementation. Three of the four reported supplementation as a protective factor against mortality in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that vitamin D supplementation group had a higher mortality than the group without, although it has low validity and high risk of bias. In conclusion, there were differences in the severity and mortality risk between COVID-19 patients given vitamin D supplementation and control patients. Vitamin D supplementation is a protective factor in the severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 patients. © 2021, Journal of International Dental and Medical Research, All Rights Reserved.","Setyarini, I.

However, other host factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells and that the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction. In vitro binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models depleted cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

All suspected patients underwent a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction at arrival, whereas 82.1% in the nonsuspected (P = 0.054). Among the 24 patients either nonoperatively managed or whose operation was delayed for >24 hours, only 1 (4.2%) died.

The postoperative course of both patients with recent COVID-19 was characterized by severe coagulopathy requiring massive transfusions and prolonged ICU stay. However, both survived to hospital discharge. In light of the possible dismal outcomes associated with dual diagnoses of type A aortic dissection/COVID-19 and the higher-than-expected number of asymptomatic carriers, all type A dissection patients should be immediately tested for COVID-19.

To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19.

215921,Gendered Experiences of Software Engineers During the COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are prone to infections due to underlying immune dysfunction in them. We aimed to study the role of inflammatory markers, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in predicting infection, blood culture positivity, and short-term (1 month) mortality in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. METHODS: This prospective study was done over a period of 14 months (October 2017 to November 2018). Patient data included age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, reason for admission, and comorbidity. Laboratory tests included blood chemistry and blood cell counts, and blood and urine culture. The specific tests included were CRP and NLR. Survival of patients in the following 1 month was noted. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy were calculated and logistic regression analysis performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients formed the study cohort. The median age was 51.5 years and male predominance was noted. Alcohol-related liver disease (49%) was the commonest etiology. The infection rate was 62%, culture positivity was 58.5%, and mortality was 30.8%. NLR and CRP were significantly higher in those with documented infection (culture positive or negative) and among nonsurvivors. Optimal cutoffs for NLR and CRP to predict infection were 5.86 and 33.7, respectively. The risk of having an infection was 7.5 times and about 15 times if NLR and CRP were above the cutoffs. The risk of 1-month mortality was 2-3 times higher if patients had NLR and CRP above the cutoffs. The combination of NLR and CRP (&#8805; 5.86 and &#8805; 33.7, respectively) increased specificity and diagnostic accuracy for infection. CONCLUSION: NLR and CRP were independently good predictors of infection and 1-month survival among the patients with cirrhosis of liver included in this study.","Tapadia, Ashishkumar; Jain, Mayank; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Mahadevan, B; Varghese, Joy; Venkataraman, Jayanthi",Indian j. gastroenterol,,569

Thus, the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with poor PS remains unclear. Herein, we used data from a retrospective cohort to assess the potential clinical benefits of ICIs in NSCLC patients with poor PS. Data from NSCLC patients who received ICI monotherapy at nine institutions between December 2015 and May 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. After excluding 4 patients who lacked PS data, a total of 527 ICI-treated patients, including 79 patients with PS 2 or higher, were used for our analyses. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with PS 2 or higher were significantly shorter compared with those of PS 0-1 patients median PFS, 4.1 vs. 2.0 months; p < 0.001 and median OS, 17.4 vs. 4.0 months; p < 0.001). Among NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression &#8805; 50% who were treated with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy, the median PFS times of patients with PS 2 and 0-1 were 7.3 and 8.1 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS between patients with PS 2 and 0-1 (p = 0.321). Although poor PS was significantly associated with worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, administration of pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment in NSCLC patients expressing high levels of PD-L1 may provide a clinical benefit, even in patients with PS 2.","Kano, Hirohisa; Ichihara, Eiki; Harada, Daijiro; Inoue, Koji; Kayatani, Hiroe; Hosokawa, Shinobu; Kishino, Daizo; Watanabe, Kazuhiko; Ochi, Nobuaki; Oda, Naohiro; Hara, Naofumi; Ninomiya, Kiichiro; Hotta, Katsuyuki; Maeda, Yoshinobu; Kiura, Katsuyuki",Cancer sci,,569

Recommendations from scientific societies seek to provide safety for newborns without compromising the benefits of early contact. The aim of the study is to describe characteristics and evolution of newborns born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the implemented measures following recommendations from the Sociedad Española de Neonatología. METHODS: Observational, prospective and single-center cohort study. A specific circuit was designed for mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their newborns. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. PCR were performed in newborns at delivery and at 14 days of age. RESULTS: 73 mothers and 75 newborns were included in the study. 95.9% of maternal infections were diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy, 43.8% were asymptomatic. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (IQR: 37-40), 25.9% of newborns required admission to Neonatology. Skin-to-skin mother care was performed in 68% of newborns, 80% received exclusive maternal or donated breast milk during hospital stay. No positive PCR results were observed in newborns at delivery, one case of positive PCR was observed in an asymptomatic neonate at 14 days of age. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is low when complying to the recommendations issued by Sociedad Española de Neonatología, allowing rooming-in and promoting breastfeeding.","Solís-García, Gonzalo; Gutiérrez-Vélez, Ana; Pescador Chamorro, Isabel; Zamora-Flores, Elena; Vigil-Vázquez, Sara; Rodríguez-Corrales, Elena; Sánchez-Luna, Manuel",An. pediatr.

219884,The Routledge Handbook of Planning Theory,2020,"Background: In Australia, telehealth services were used as an alternative method of health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a realist analysis of a survey of health professionals, we have sought to identify the underlying mechanisms that have assisted Australian health services adapt to the physical separation between clinicians and patients. Methods: Using a critical realist ontology and epistemology, we undertook an online survey of health professionals subscribing to the Australian Telehealth Society newsletter. The survey had close- and open-ended questions, constructed to identify contextual changes in the operating environment for telehealth services, and assess the mechanisms which had contributed to these changes. We applied descriptive and McNemar's Chi-square analysis for the close-ended component of the survey, and a reflexive thematic analysis approach for the open-ended questions which were framed within the activity based funding system which had previously limited telehealth services to regional Australia. Results: Of the 91 respondents most (73%) reported a higher volume of telephone-based care since COVID and an increase in use of video consultations (60% of respondents). Respondents felt that the move to provide care using telehealth services had been a ""forced adoption"" where clinicians began to use telehealth services (often for the first time) to maintain health care. Respondents noted significant changes in managerial and medical culture which supported the legitimisation of telehealth services as a mode of access to care. The support of leaders and the use personal and organisational networks to facilitate the operation of telehealth service were felt to be particularly valuable. Access to, and reliability of, the technology were considered extremely important for services. Respondents also welcomed the increased availability of more human and financial resources. Conclusions: During the pandemic, mechanisms that legitimise practise, build confidence, support relationships and supply resources have fostered the use of telehealth. This ongoing interaction between telehealth services, contexts and mechanisms is complex. The adoption of telehealth access to enable physically separated care, may mark a ""new context;"" or it could be that once the pandemic passes, previous policies and practises will re-assert themselves and curb support for telehealth-enabled care.","Taylor, Alan; Caffery, Liam J; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; King, Alice; Bassal, Abdel-Rahman; Ford, Kim; Kealey, Jane; Maeder, Anthony; McGuirk, Michelle; Parkes, Donna; Ward, Paul R",Front Public Health,,569

Cross-sectional results from 466 participants showed that neuroticism and emotion regulation strategies were associated with higher loneliness and lower well-being. However, in contrast to prior research, associations of extraversion with loneliness and well-being were weak and were qualified by interactions with emotion regulation. For introverts, maladaptive cognitive strategies such as rumination or catastrophizing were related to higher levels of loneliness. For extraverts, emotion suppression was related to lower levels of affective well-being. Individuals with low maladaptive regulation reported higher well-being the longer the public life restrictions were in place at the time of study participation. These findings suggest that first, extraversion may lose some of its protective value for loneliness and well-being when opportunities to engage in social activities are limited; second, that loneliness and well-being do not decrease over 6 weeks of public life restrictions; and third, that future studies should further investigate the moderating role of emotion regulation on the link between personality, loneliness, and well-being.","Gubler, Danièle A; Makowski, Lisa M; Troche, Stefan J; Schlegel, Katja",J Happiness Stud,,569

This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of the echocardiographic Eâ/â(Ea×Sa) index guided diuretic therapy compared to urine output (conventional) guided diuretic treatment.Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were hospitalized due to acute decompensation episode were consecutively allocated in a 1:1 ratio to monitoring arms. The diuretic dose, which provided 20â% reduction in the Eâ/â(Ea×Sa) index value compared to initial value, was determined as adequate dose in echocardiography guided monitoring group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), change in weight, NT pro-BNP level and dyspnea assessment on visual analogue scale (VAS) were analyzed at the end of the monitoring.Results Although the similar doses of diuretics were used in both groups, the patients with Eâ/â(Ea×Sa) index guided strategy had the substantial lower NT pro-BNP level within 72 hours after diuretic administration (2172 vs.2514 pgâ/âmL, p= 0.036). VAS score on dyspnea assessment was significantly better in the patients with Eâ/â(Ea×Sa) index guided strategy (52 vs. 65; p= 0.04). And, in term of body weight loss (4.93 vs.5.21 kg, p=0.87) and e-GFR (54.58±8.6 vs. 52.65±9.1 mLâ/âminâ/â1.73 m2p=0.74) in both groups are associated with similar outcomes. In both groups, there was no worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalance that required stopping or decreasing loop diuretic dosing.Conclusions The Eâ/â(Ea×Sa) index guidance might be a safe strategy for more effective diuretic response that deserves consideration for selected a subgroup of acute decomposed HFrEF patients.","Karakus, Alper; Uguz, Berat",Kardiologiia,,569

The authors outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute to deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. The authors suggest these have contributed to divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities with COVID-19 disease outcomes.

222992,Innovations in leisure education: revisiting and re-imagining leisure education,2020,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological, pathological and radiological studies suggest that inflammatory demyelination in MS is an age-dependent process, and that the formation of focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions decreases with age. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are a biomarker of inflammatory disease activity in MS, but little is known about the relation of age and gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans in people with MS. In this study, we investigated the association of age and other risk factors with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI in a retrospective cross-sectional clinical MS cohort. METHODS: In a cohort including 1543 people with CIS and MS, we investigated the association of the risk factors age, sex, disease course, immunomodulatory drug (IMD) treatment, and disability with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: Age was the most important factor associated with gadolinium enhancement, with the odds of gadolinium enhancement decreasing with advancing age. Participants with CIS had lower odds of gadolinium enhancement (odds ratio of 0.42, 95% confidence interval of 0.24-0.72 compared to RRMS). Sex, disease course and IMD treatment were not significantly associated with gadolinium enhancement in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation shows that gadolinium enhancement is strongly associated with age. Since gadolinium enhancement is a marker of inflammatory disease activity, our findings suggest that inflammatory disease activity declines with age, and that IMD treatment may be more beneficial in younger and less useful in older people with MS.","Koch, Marcus W; Mostert, Jop; Greenfield, Jamie; Liu, Wei-Qiao; Metz, Luanne",J. neurol,,569

An Analysis at the US Statewide Level,2020,"Accurate phenotyping of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an integral part of informing disease classification, treatment, and prognosis. The impact of lung disease on PH outcomes and response to treatment remains a challenging area with limited progress. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in patients with suspected PH when assessing for parenchymal lung disease, however, current assessments are limited by their semi-qualitative nature. Quantitative chest-CT (QCT) allows numerical quantification of lung parenchymal disease beyond subjective visual assessment. This has facilitated advances in radiological assessment and clinical correlation of a range of lung diseases including emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Artificial Intelligence approaches have the potential to facilitate rapid quantitative assessments. Benefits of cross-sectional imaging include ease and speed of scan acquisition, repeatability and the potential for novel insights beyond visual assessment alone. Potential clinical benefits include improved phenotyping and prediction of treatment response and survival. Artificial intelligence approaches also have the potential to aid more focused study of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies by identifying more homogeneous subgroups of patients with lung disease. This state-of-the-art review summarizes recent QCT developments and potential applications in patients with PH with a focus on lung disease.","Dwivedi, K.; Sharkey, M.; Condliffe, R.; Uthoff, J.

Moreover, determining COVID-19 complications and the condition of patients with hematological disease and cancer, and determining a personalized treatment strategy that prioritizes the treatment of high-risk conditions is necessary when suffering from COVID-19. However, another problem is when the patient refrains from visiting a medical institution due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 infection and becomes seriously ill. Furthermore, the lack of medical resources has affected the treatment of pediatric patients with hematological disease and cancer (e.g., delays and changes in treatment).

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 which causes the disease, but the evidence from in vivo studies so far has been incon-clusive. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Data Sources: We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Joanna Briggs Institute Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) for all articles published between 01 January 2020 to 15 September 2020 on CQ/HCQ and COVID-19 using a predefined search protocol;without any language restrictions. A search of grey literature repositories (New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature and Open Grey), and pre-publication server deposits (medRxIV and bioRxIV) was also performed. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials (RCT) which compared CQ/HCQ to standard supportive therapy in treating COVID-19 were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted from original publications by four independent review-ers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s assessment tool. Data were meta-analyzed using a random-effect models. Results are reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary prespecified efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was any adverse effect attributed to use of CQ/HCQ. Results: Eight RCTs were included and pooled in the mortality meta-analysis (6,592 unique participants;mean age = 59.4 years;42% women). CQ/HCQ did not show any mortality benefit when compared to standard supportive therapy (Pooled Relative Risk [RR] 1.07;95% CI = 0.97-1.18;I2 statistic = 0.00%). Sensitivity and sub-group analyses showed similar findings. Any adverse event was significantly higher in patients randomized to CQ/HCQ (RR = 2.51;95% CI = 1.53-4.12;n = 1,818 patients), but the risk of developing severe adverse event was not statistically significant (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.53-1.86;n = 6,456 patients). Conclusions and Relevance: Evidence from currently published RCTs do not demonstrate any added benefit for the use of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Eze, P.; Mezue, K.

While existing paradigms commonly further pre-train language models such as BERT on a vast amount of unlabeled corpus, we find it highly effective and efficient to simply fine-tune BERT with a small set of labeled utterances from public datasets. Specifically, fine-tuning BERT with roughly 1,000 labeled data yields a pre-trained model -- IntentBERT, which can easily surpass the performance of existing pre-trained models for few-shot intent classification on novel domains with very different semantics. The high effectiveness of IntentBERT confirms the feasibility and practicality of few-shot intent detection, and its high generalization ability across different domains suggests that intent classification tasks may share a similar underlying structure, which can be efficiently learned from a small set of labeled data.

A key portion of the medical work force on the frontline is composed of resident physicians. Thus, it becomes imperative to create an adequate and effective action plan to restructure this valuable human resource amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We sought to describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused in resident training and support. OBJECTIVE: To describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused on resident training and support. RESULTS: A restructuring of the Neurosurgery Department at our academic institution was performed focused on decreasing their risk of infection/exposure and transmission to others, while minimizing negative consequences in the training experience. An online academic platform was built for resident education, guidance, and support, as well as continue channel for pandemic update by the department leadership. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic constitutes a global health emergency full of uncertainty. Treatment, scope, duration, and economic burden forced a major restructuring of our medical practice. In this regard, academic institutions must direct efforts to diminish further negative impact in the training and education of the upcoming generation of physicians, including those currently in medical school. Perhaps the only silver lining in this terrible disruption will be greater appreciation of the role of current health care providers and educators, whose contributions to our society are often neglected or unrecognized.","Fernandes Cabral, David T; Alan, Nima; Agarwal, Nitin; Lunsford, L Dade; Monaco, Edward A",World neurosurgery (Online),,569

227707,"The impact of trust, convenience, and risk perception on online frozen food purchase decision",2021,"This essay challenges generalizations since the late enlightenment about the effects of epidemics and pandemics on collective mentalities: that from antiquity to the present, epidemics, regardless of the disease, have sparked distrust, social violence, and the blaming of others. By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe. The essay then explores the variety of charitable reactions and abnegation that cut across social divisions in communities from theatres of war in Europe to nations thousands of miles from the direct military encounters. Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths.

Elderly patients with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, are more likely to have severe disease and deaths. Neurological complications are frequently reported in severely or critically ill patients with comorbidities. In COVID-19, both central and peripheral nervous systems can be affected. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19 and has the potential to invade the brain. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the brain either via a hematogenous route or olfactory system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme two receptors, present on endothelial cells of cerebral vessels, are a possible viral entry point. The most severe neurological manifestations, altered sensorium (agitation, delirium, and coma), are because of hypoxic and metabolic abnormalities. Characteristic cytokine storm incites severe metabolic changes and multiple organ failure. Profound coagulopathies may manifest with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Rarely, SARS-CoV-2 virus encephalitis or pictures like acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported. Nonspecific headache is a commonly experienced neurological symptom. A new type of headache ""personal protection equipment-related headache"" has been described. Complete or partial anosmia and ageusia are common peripheral nervous system manifestations. Recently, many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in COVID-19 patients have been observed, and a postinfectious immune-mediated inflammatory process was held responsible for this. Guillain-Barré syndrome does respond to intravenous immunoglobulin. Myalgia/fatigue is also common, and elevated creatine kinase levels indicate muscle injury.

The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to quantify the level of anxiety. RESULTS: 1416 HCWs (70.8% medical doctors, 26.2% nurses) responded to the survey from 75 countries. The distribution of anxiety levels was: normal/minimal (n = 503, 35.5%), low (n = 390, 27.5%); moderate (n = 287, 20.3%), and severe (n = 236, 16.7%).

Even if vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection is becoming increasingly available, a more feasible approach for COVID-19 prevention and therapy is still needed. Evidence of a pathological link between metabolic diseases and severe forms of COVID-19 has stimulated critical reflection and new considerations. In particular, an abnormal immune response observed in certain patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested possible common predisposing risk factors with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Correct supplementation with dietary factors may be key to preventing and counteracting both the underlying metabolic impairment and the complications of COVID-19. A set of agents may inhibit the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability that characterize severe COVID-19 infection: vitamin D3, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols like pterostilbene, polydatin and honokiol, which can activate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant sirtuins pathways, quercetin, vitamin C, zinc, melatonin, lactoferrin and glutathione. These agents could be highly beneficial for subjects who have altered immune responses. In this review, we discuss the antiviral and metabolic effects of these dietary factors and propose their combination for potential applications in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Rigorous studies will be fundamental for validating preventive and therapeutic protocols that could be of assistance to mitigate disease progression following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ricordi, Camillo; Pacifici, Francesca; Lanzoni, Giacomo; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Garaci, Enrico; Della-Morte, David",Int. j. mol. sci.

230983,Community nursing placements: student learning experiences during a pandemic and beyond,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine early and late pregnancy loss in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing IVF/ICSI transfers. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Reproductive medicine centre at a tertiary hospital. POPULATION: We studied women with a positive ß-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) after in vitro fertilisation/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment from May 2014 to April 2019. METHODS: Odds ratios (OR) for early (&#8804;13 weeks) and late (>13 weeks) pregnancy loss were calculated among women with and without PCOS for plurality of the pregnancy with adjustment for confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early pregnancy loss (EPL) and late pregnancy loss (LPL). RESULTS: From 21 820 women identified with a positive ß-hCG, 2357 (10.8%) women had PCOS, and 19 463 (89.2%) women did not. EPL occurred in 16.6% (391) of women with PCOS versus 18.3% (3565) in women with non-PCOS (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.99, P = 0.04). After adjustment for age and other confounders, the rate of EPL was not statistically significantly associated with PCOS status (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.05). Women with PCOS demonstrated a higher rate of LPL (6.4% in PCOS versus 3.6% in non-PCOS, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.48-2.21, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, the potential impact of PCOS was less strong (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96-1.98), with BMI and maternal comorbidities also associated with LPL (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.1 and aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.43-3.00, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Polycystic ovary syndrome was not independently associated with EPL. There was an increased risk of LPL but this difference was not statistically significant. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Polycystic ovary syndrome women are at increased risk of late pregnancy loss, partly driven by elevated BMI and maternal comorbidities.","Cai, He; Mol, B W; Gordts, S; Wang, H; Wang, T; Li, N; Shi, J",BJOG,,569

231869,"Crime and coronavirus: social distancing, lockdown, and the mobility elasticity of crime",2020,"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 564,000 Canadians are currently living with dementia and there are approximately 486,000 to 1.1 million informal family/friend caregivers. Family/friend caregivers often receive little to no education or training about dementia but are expected to provide ongoing support for a complex condition. Web-based family/friend caregiver interventions may be helpful, but little is known about how best to implement them. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) design and develop a novel education prescription application to help scale and spread web-based dementia education to family/friend caregivers, 2) conduct user testing, and 3) conduct a larger-scale field trial. METHODS: A novel education prescription web-based application was designed and developed. Initial user testing used task completion and the ""think aloud"" technique with a small sample of representative clinicians who work with people living with dementia and family/friend caregivers. Following iterative incorporation of feedback, a larger field trial was conducted with a convenience sample of clinicians. Account invitations were sent to 55 clinicians and, following a 2-month trial period, surveys were administered to participants including the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. RESULTS: During the initial user testing phase, participants (N=7) from representative disciplines easily completed associated tasks, and had very positive feedback with respect to the usability of the application. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 91.4. Suggestions from feedback were incorporated into the application. During the larger field trial phase, participants (total N=55; activated account n=17; did not activate account n=38) were given access to the iGeriCare education prescription application. During this period, 2 participants created educational prescriptions; a total of 3 educational prescriptions were sent. Survey completers who did not activate their account (n=5) identified that their lack of use was due to time constraints, competing priorities, or forgetting to use the application. Survey completers who activated their account (n=5) identified their lower use was due to lack of time, lack of eligible family/friend caregivers during trial period, and competing priorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 78.75, and the Net Promoter Score was 50. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate a generally positive response for the usability of a web-based application for clinicians to prescribe dementia education to family/friend caregivers. The dissonance between the promising data and widespread enthusiasm for the design and purpose of the education prescription application found in the initial user testing phase and subsequent lack of significant adoption in the field trial represents both an important lesson for other novel health technologies and a potential area for further investigation. Further research is required to better understand factors associated with implementation of this type of intervention and impact on dissemination of education to family/friend caregivers.","Levinson, Anthony J; Bousfield, John; Douglas, William; Ayers, Stephanie; Sztramko, Richard",JMIR Hum Factors,,569
232001,Preconditions for Competitive Development of the Agricultural Production Potential in Light of the Economic Consequences of the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grave global public health emergency. Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.","Han, Xuehua; Wang, Juanle; Zhang, Min; Wang, Xiaojie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569
232239,Universal PCR screening for COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients on admission,2020,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment modality for a range of psychiatric illnesses. It is shown to be useful in the management of psychotic disorders for decades, more so in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia when given with antipsychotic medications. We highlight a case of a 37-year-old lady who was on treatment for refractory schizophrenia for the past 10 years but had continued to exhibit residual psychotic symptoms of auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions that resulted in numerous in-patient admissions. She was initiated on ECT but contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) before she could receive her second session. After isolating for 2 weeks in a COVID-19-designated isolation ward and testing negative twice, she was rescheduled to continue with her ECT. Ten minutes after leaving theater upon successfully undergoing her second ECT session, she collapsed suddenly and died. An autopsy done later revealed pulmonary thromboembolism as the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: Although ECT is a safe procedure, caution should be exercised in the context of COVID-19, as it is now clear that patients who recovered from COVID-19 might have an undetected venous thromboembolism that can cause untoward outcomes.

Pandemics have occurred throughout human history and appear to be increasing because of rising emergence of viral diseases from animals (zoonoses). The risk of a pandemic arises from the combined effects of the Spark Risk (e.g. bushmeat hunting) and the Spread Risk (e.g. mode of transmission and population susceptibility). Pandemics have health, economic, gender, social and political impacts. Building pandemic preparedness is complex and requires considerable coordination. In the context of Covid-19, modelling of transmission has been central to many government’s response including introduction of lockdown and physical distancing. Developing vaccines for novel pathogens is not simple or straightforward and community mitigation measures are essential. There are a number of lessons which have been learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic including acting quickly, extensive testing, digital surveillance, public trust in government and leaders and cooperation between nations. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. Case reports and case series of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers screened 366 studies and 14 studies were included. Four reviewers independently extracted the features from the studies. We used a random-effects model to analyse the incidence (P) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 236 pregnant women with COVID-19. The results were as follows: positive CT findings (71%; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93), caesarean section (65%; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), fever (51%; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67), lymphopenia (49%; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), coexisting disorders (33%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44), cough (31%; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), fetal distress (29%; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), preterm labor (23%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.32), and severe case or death (12%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.20). The subgroup analysis showed that compared with non-pregnant patients, pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly lower incidences of fever (pregnant women, 51%; non-pregnant patients, 91%; P < 0.00001) and cough (pregnant women, 31%; non-pregnant patients, 67%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of fever, cough and positive CT findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are less than those in the normal population with COVID-19, but the rate of preterm labor is higher among pregnant with COVID-19 than among normal pregnant women. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through vertical transmission.","Gao, Yi-Jie; Ye, Lei; Zhang, Jia-Shuo; Yin, Yang-Xue; Liu, Min; Yu, Hong-Biao; Zhou, Rong",BMC Infect Dis,,569

It makes no assumptions of objectness (e.g. canonical poses, models, or keypoints), it exploits spatial symmetries, and is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than our benchmarked alternatives in learning vision-based manipulation tasks: from stacking a pyramid of blocks, to assembling kits with unseen objects; from manipulating deformable ropes, to pushing piles of small objects with closed-loop feedback. Our method can represent complex multi-modal policy distributions and generalizes to multi-step sequential tasks, as well as 6DoF pick-and-place. Experiments on 10 simulated tasks show that it learns faster and generalizes better than a variety of end-to-end baselines, including policies that use ground-truth object poses.

To prevent or control HAIs, evaluating the organisms isolated from the critically maintained areas is considered of epitome importance and everlasting practice in the healthcare industry. Identifying such organisms and screening them for antibiotic resistance is mandatory, but it also helps professionals understand colonization trends. Sensitive areas of healthcare setups were screened monthly from years 2017 to 2020. A total of 4400 samples of hospital hygiene, e.g., intravenous drip stands, ventilator surface, anesthetist's trolley, patient's bed, instrument trolley, etcetera, were collected. Isolated organisms were cultured and screened using the CLSI technique. E. coli, Pseudomonas spp., and Klebsiella spp. were found in both previous to COVID current samples. Multidrug-resistant organisms were subjected to molecular characterization to detect the presence of carbapenem genes. Evaluation data of both pre-and during Coronavirus Disease or COVID-19 were compared. The prevalence of pathogenic (Klebsiella spp., E. coli, and Pseudomonas spp.) and nonpathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp.) strains in healthcare setups decreased drastically (Klebsiella spp. from 80% to 20%, E.coli from 90% to 10% and Pseudomonas spp. from 80% to 20%). It is possible only because of the awareness in non-specialists and healthcare workers due to the unforeseen critical situation proving to be a blessing for the future generation.

235404,Assessment of the Readability of Online Patient Education Material from Major Geriatric Associations,2020,"Magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested cardiac involvement post-Covid-19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes. This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

Community pharmacists have an important role in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students' awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). RESULTS: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops.

236470,Topic index,2021,"BACKGROUND: Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]). METHODS: We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged &#8805;18 to &#8804;55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 µg, 15 µg, or 45 µg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 µg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose. The study is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495933. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 µg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683-11â122), with 15 µg dose (7492, 4959-11â319), and the two 45 µg dose cohorts (8770, 5526-13â920 in the two-dose 45 µg cohort; 8793, 5570-13â881 in the single-dose 45 µg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 µg doses (102â400, 64â857-161â676), with two 15 µg doses (74â725, 51â300-108â847), with two 45 µg doses (79â586, 55â430-114â268), only a single 45 µg dose (4795, 2858-8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 µg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 µg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146-356), two 15 µg doses (230, 170-312), and two 45 µg doses (239, 187-307). INTERPRETATION: This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.

Current data indicate that nationally, Black Americans are three times more likely than White Americans to contract Covid-19 (with further variance by state), a pattern that underscores the more general phenomenon of health disparity among Black and White Americans (Oppel et al. in The New York Times 2020; APM Research Lab Staff in APM Research Lab 2020). Once exposed, Black Americans are twice as likely to die of the virus. Unsurprisingly, Black Americans report higher levels of fear of Covid-19 than their White peers, but they also report higher levels of hesitancy toward a Covid-19 vaccine. This paper explores why this apparent discrepancy exists. It also provides practical recommendations for how government and public health leaders might address vaccine hesitancy in the context of the twin crises of 2020.","Bunch, Lauren",HEC forum,,569

Case Report: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of ""fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia."" Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient's symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive. Conclusion: Chest computed tomography offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.","An, Peng; Song, Ping; Lian, Kai; Wang, Yong",Balkan Med J,,569
239676,Can hydroxychloroquine cause G6PD-related hemolysis? A case study,2020,"Importance: It is unknown whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have a positive, neutral, or negative effect on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

Our studies on ACE2 identified a haplotype present among 20% and 60% of European and South Asian populations, respectively, which appears to be responsible for the low case fatality rate among South Asian populations. This result was also consistent with the real-time infection rate and case fatality rate among various states of India. We readdressed this issue using both of the contrasting datasets and compared them with the real-time infection rates and case fatality rate in India.

Our model is based on the susceptible-exposed-infectives-removed (SEIR) model, including an asymptomatic transmission rate, time-dependent incubation period and time-dependent transmission rate. We carry out the analysis with the available disease data up to the end of August 2020, with a projection of 42 days into the months of September and October 2020, based on the past data. Overall, we have presented a projection up to 351 days (till February 2021) for India and we have found that our model is able to predict correctly the first phase of the pandemic in India with correct projections of the peak of the pandemic as well as daily new infections. We also find the existence of a critical day, signifying a sudden shift in the transmission pattern of the disease, with interesting relation of the behaviour of the pandemic with demographic and socio-economic parameters. Towards the end, we have modelled the available data with the help of logistic equations and compare this with our model.

No effective antiviral drug is currently available to treat COVID-19 and any other human coronavirus infections. We report herein that a CFDA-approved macrolide antibiotic, carrimycin, potently inhibited the cytopathic effects (CPE) and reduced the levels of viral protein and RNA in multiple cell types infected by human coronavirus 229E, OC43, and SARS-CoV-2. Time-of-addition and pseudotype virus infection studies indicated that carrimycin inhibited one or multiple post-entry replication events of human coronavirus infection. In support of this notion, metabolic labelling studies showed that carrimycin significantly inhibited the synthesis of viral RNA. Our studies thus strongly suggest that carrimycin is an antiviral agent against a broad-spectrum of human coronaviruses and its therapeutic efficacy to COVID-19 is currently under clinical investigation.","Yan, Haiyan; Sun, Jing; Wang, Kun; Wang, Huiqiang; Wu, Shuo; Bao, Linlin; He, Weiqing; Wang, Dong; Zhu, Airu; Zhang, Tian; Gao, Rongmei; Dong, Biao; Li, Jianrui; Yang, Lu; Zhong, Ming; Lv, Qi; Qin, Feifei; Zhuang, Zhen; Huang, Xiaofang; Yang, Xinyi; Li, Yuhuan; Che, Yongsheng; Jiang, Jiandong",,,569

This multicenter, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study aimed to assess the use of subcutaneous tocilizumab in adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Tocilizumab was added to the standard care of therapy at a dose of 324 mg (<100 kg bodyweight) or 486 mg (&#8805;100 kg bodyweight). The study endpoints were all-cause mortality rate, changes in oxygen-support level, oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiratory rate, and laboratory variables during the study, and drug safety. Of 126 patients enrolled, 86 had severe and 40 had critical disease. Most patients were male (63.49%) and aged below 65 (78.57%). By day 14 of the study, 4.65% (4/86) of severe patients and 50.00% (20/40) of critical patients died. By the end, 6.98% (6/86) of severe patients and 60.00% (24/40) of critical patients died.Outcomes concerning three additional endpoints (oral temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate)were significantly improved as early as three days after tocilizumab administration in both groups of subjects, more considerably in severe patients. Significant improvement in the required level of oxygenation was reported in severe patients seven days after tocilizumab administration. No tocilizumab-related serious adverse event occurred in this study. Subcutaneous tocilizumab might improve some clinical parameters and reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients, particularly if used in the early stages of respiratory failure.","Malekzadeh, Reza; Abedini, Atefeh; Mohsenpour, Behzad; Sharifipour, Ehsan; Ghasemian, Roya; Javad-Mousavi, Seyed Ali; Khodashahi, Rozita; Darban, Mahboobeh; Kalantari, Saeed; Abdollahi, Nafiseh; Salehi, Mohammad Reza; Rezaei Hosseinabadi, Abbas; Khorvash, Farzin; Valizadeh, Melika; Dastan, Farzaneh; Yousefian, Sahar; Hosseini, Hamed; Anjidani, Nassim; Tabarsi, Payam",Int Immunopharmacol,,569

Though the environment got ameliorated with low pollution levels, this unexpected lockdown has taken a toll on humans' mental health. As the effects of lockdown can affect college students due to fear, anxiety and stress, this study intends to assess the attitude of the university students. Methodology: An online questionnaire survey comprising 15 questions was conducted among four South Indian state university students. Their responses were recorded through Google Forms. The submitted responses were analysed using SPSS software version 17. Results: In total, 1241 responses were recorded from university students belonging to various faculties. Though 43% considered this lockdown as a convenient break, 60% could not focus on their studies. The importance of renewing relationships was felt by 47%, and 83% tried to learn a new skill. Students from Tamil Nadu were looking forward towards a brighter future after the lockdown. Conclusion: This survey conducted in the early days of lockdown indicated that the university students were not anxious about the long-term effects of the pandemic but showed a decline in their academic performance.","John, Reena Rachel; P John, Rohit",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,569

242141,Risk Management and Learning Climate in Emergency Contexts: A Qualitative Study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5°C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points). CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.","Kline, Jeffrey A; Camargo, Carlos A; Courtney, D Mark; Kabrhel, Christopher; Nordenholz, Kristen E; Aufderheide, Thomas; Baugh, Joshua J; Beiser, David G; Bennett, Christopher L; Bledsoe, Joseph; Castillo, Edward; Chisolm-Straker, Makini; Goldberg, Elizabeth M; House, Hans; House, Stacey; Jang, Timothy; Lim, Stephen C; Madsen, Troy E; McCarthy, Danielle M; Meltzer, Andrew; Moore, Stephen; Newgard, Craig; Pagenhardt, Justine; Pettit, Katherine L; Pulia, Michael S; Puskarich, Michael A; Southerland, Lauren T; Sparks, Scott; Turner-Lawrence, Danielle; Vrablik, Marie; Wang, Alfred; Weekes, Anthony J; Westafer, Lauren; Wilburn, John",PLoS One,,569

242530,Supporting Breastfeeding in 2021 and Beyond—Lessons from the Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Henan Province, China. In phase 1, healthy people aged 18-80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of screening, were separated into two age groups (18-59 years and &#8805;60 years) and randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 µg, 4 µg, or 8 µg on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18-59 years) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo on a single-dose schedule of 8 µg on day 0 or on a two-dose schedule of 4 µg on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28. Participants within each cohort were randomly assigned by stratified block randomisation (block size eight) and allocated (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo. Group allocation was concealed from participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2. This study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000032459. FINDINGS: In phase 1, 192 participants were enrolled (mean age 53·7 years [SD 15·6]) and were randomly assigned to receive vaccine (2 µg [n=24], 4 µg [n=24], or 8 µg [n=24] for both age groups [18-59 years and &#8805;60 years]) or placebo (n=24). At least one adverse reaction was reported within the first 7 days of inoculation in 42 (29%) of 144 vaccine recipients. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (18-59 years, one [4%] in the 2 µg group, one [4%] in the 4 µg group, and two [8%] in the 8 µg group; &#8805;60 years, one [4%] in the 8 µg group). All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18-59 years (87·7 [95% CI 64·9-118·6], 2 µg group; 211·2 [158·9-280·6], 4 µg group; and 228·7 [186·1-281·1], 8 µg group) and the group aged 60 years and older (80·7 [65·4-99·6], 2 µg group; 131·5 [108·2-159·7], 4 µg group; and 170·87 [133·0-219·5], 8 µg group) compared with the placebo group (2·0 [2·0-2·0]). In phase 2, 448 participants were enrolled (mean age 41·7 years [SD 9·9]) and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (8 µg on day 0 [n=84] or 4 µg on days 0 and 14 [n=84], days 0 and 21 [n=84], or days 0 and 28 [n=84]) or placebo on the same schedules (n=112). At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days was reported in 76 (23%) of 336 vaccine recipients (33 [39%], 8 µg day 0; 18 [21%], 4 µg days 0 and 14; 15 [18%], 4 µg days 0 and 21; and ten [12%], 4 µg days 0 and 28). One placebo recipient in the 4 µg days 0 and 21 group reported grade 3 fever, but was self-limited and recovered. All other adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. The most common systematic adverse reaction was fever (one [1%], 8 µg day 0; one [1%], 4 µg days 0 and 14; three [4%], 4 µg days 0 and 21; two [2%], 4 µg days 0 and 28). The vaccine-elicited neutralising antibody titres on day 28 were significantly greater in the 4 µg days 0 and 14 (169·5, 95% CI 132·2-217·1), days 0 and 21 (282·7, 221·2-361·4), and days 0 and 28 (218·0, 181·8-261·3) schedules than the 8 µg day 0 schedule (14·7, 11·6-18·8; all p<0·001). INTERPRETATION: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in two age groups. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were induced in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Two-dose immunisation with 4 µg vaccine on days 0 and 21 or days 0 and 28 achieved higher neutralising antibody titres than the single 8 µg dose or 4 µg dose on days 0 and 14.

About 20% of patients develop severe disease and require hospitalisation, which is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 97% in those being ventilated and respiratory failure being the leading cause of death. Despite many therapeutic agents being under current investigation there is yet no panacea available. With increasing rates of infection throughout the world, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to counteract the infection. As the nervous system has shown to be a strong modulator of respiratory function and the immune response, we want to highlight pathways involved in regulation of respiratory function, the neuro-immune axis as well as the rationale for a potential targeted treatment of fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome via transcutaneous non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.","Bara, Gregor A; de Ridder, Dirk; Maciaczyk, Jaroslaw",Med Hypotheses,,569

Currently, the accumulating information on the effects of the infection regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of the disease, as well as outcomes within different DMTs¸ enable us to have better practices on the management of the Covid-19 infection in pwMS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to reveal the relationship between the demographic-clinical and therapeutic features and the outcome of Covid-19 infection in a multi-center national cohort of pwMS. METHODS: The Turkish Neurological Society-MS Study Group in association with the Italian MuSC-19 Study Group initiated this study. A web-based electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) of Study-MuSC-19 were used to collect the data. The demographic data and MS histories of the patients were obtained from the file tracking forms of the relevant clinics.

245229,Spirituality in a Time of Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Studies describing the performance characteristics of the cobas®6800 system for SARS-CoV-2 detection in deep respiratory specimens and freeze-thaw stability are limited. The current study compares the clinical performance of the automated SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 system to a lab-developed assay (LDA) and the cobas impact of freeze-thawing combined with lysis buffer. METHODS: Both retrospective and prospectively selected deep respiratory samples and oro- and nasopharyngeal samples in either E-swab® or GLY- were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 System and compared to a lab developed assay. Additonally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability was assessed after one freeze-thaw cycle with or without lysis buffer. RESULTS: In total, 221 (58.3 %) oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, 131 (34.6 %) deep respiratory specimens, and n = 25 (6.6 %) swabs of unknown origin were included to study clinical performance. Only 4 samples gave discrepant results, all being positive in the LDA and not the cobas®6800 system. For stability testing, 66 samples without and 110 with lysis buffer were included.

245230,Spirituality in a Time of Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Studies describing the performance characteristics of the cobas®6800 system for SARS-CoV-2 detection in deep respiratory specimens and freeze-thaw stability are limited. The current study compares the clinical performance of the automated SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 system to a lab-developed assay (LDA) and the cobas impact of freeze-thawing combined with lysis buffer. METHODS: Both retrospective and prospectively selected deep respiratory samples and oro- and nasopharyngeal samples in either E-swab® or GLY- were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas®6800 System and compared to a lab developed assay. Additonally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability was assessed after one freeze-thaw cycle with or without lysis buffer. RESULTS: In total, 221 (58.3 %) oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, 131 (34.6 %) deep respiratory specimens, and n = 25 (6.6 %) swabs of unknown origin were included to study clinical performance. Only 4 samples gave discrepant results, all being positive in the LDA and not the cobas®6800 system. For stability testing, 66 samples without and 110 with lysis buffer were included. No clinically significant difference was found in test results after one freeze-thaw cycle and addition of lysis buffer. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, the cobas®6800 SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay yielded similar results as the LDA in oro-/nasopharyngeal swabs and deep respiratory specimens. Moreover, the cobas®6800 SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay yielded similar results before and after a freeze-thaw cycle, with better preservation of low viral loads in lysis buffer.","Stohr, Joep J J M; Wennekes, Meike; van der Ent, Martijn; Diederen, Bram M W; Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Marjolein F Q; Bergmans, Anneke M C; Kluytmans, Jan A J W; Pas, Suzan D",J Clin Virol,,569

The process of metabolism involves many interconnected cellular pathways to ultimately provide cells with the energy required to carry out their function. The importance and the evolutionary advantage of these pathways can be seen as many remain unchanged by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. In eukaryotes, the metabolic pathways occur within the cytosol and mitochondria of cells with the utilisation of glucose or fatty acids providing the majority of cellular energy in animals. Metabolism is organised into distinct metabolic pathways to either maximise the capture of energy or minimise its use. Metabolism can be split into a series of chemical reactions that comprise both the synthesis and degradation of complex macromolecules known as anabolism or catabolism, respectively. The basic principles of energy consumption and production are discussed, alongside the biochemical pathways that make up fundamental metabolic processes for life.","Judge, Ayesha; Dodd, Michael S",Essays biochem,,569

The viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been quantitatively investigated. In this paper, we use mathematical models to study the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining the interaction between the virus, cells and immune responses. Models are fit to the data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and non-human primates. Data fitting and numerical simulation show that viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have a few distinct stages. In the initial stage, viral load increases rapidly and reaches the peak, followed by a plateau phase possibly generated by lymphocytes as a secondary target of infection. In the last stage, viral load declines due to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. When the initiation of seroconversion is late or slow, the model predicts viral rebound and prolonged viral persistence, consistent with the observation in non-human primates. Using the model we also evaluate the effect of several potential therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Model simulation shows that anti-inflammatory treatments or antiviral drugs combined with interferon are effective in reducing the duration of the viral plateau phase and diminishing the time to recovery. These results provide insights for understanding the infection dynamics and might help develop treatment strategies against COVID-19.","Wang, Sunpeng; Pan, Yang; Wang, Quanyi; Miao, Hongyu; Brown, Ashley N; Rong, Libin",Math Biosci,,569

Understanding the genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of person-to-person transmission of ANDV is crucial to designing effective interventions. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiologic information was obtained by means of patient report and from public health centers. Serologic testing, contact-tracing, and next-generation sequencing were used to identify ANDV infection as the cause of this outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and to reconstruct person-to-person transmission events. RESULTS: After a single introduction of ANDV from a rodent reservoir into the human population, transmission was driven by 3 symptomatic persons who attended crowded social events. After 18 cases were confirmed, public health officials enforced isolation of persons with confirmed cases and self-quarantine of possible contacts; these measures most likely curtailed further spread. The median reproductive number (the number of secondary cases caused by an infected person during the infectious period) was 2.12 before the control measures were enforced and decreased to 0.96 after the measures were implemented. Full genome sequencing of the ANDV strain involved in this outbreak was performed with specimens from 27 patients and showed that the strain that was present (Epuyén/18-19) was similar to the causative strain (Epilink/96) in the first known person-to-person transmission of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by ANDV, which occurred in El Bolsón, Argentina, in 1996. Clinical investigations involving patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this outbreak revealed that patients with a high viral load and liver injury were more likely than other patients to spread infection. Disease severity, genomic diversity, age, and time spent in the hospital had no clear association with secondary transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, high viral titers in combination with attendance at massive social gatherings or extensive contact among persons were associated with a higher likelihood of transmission.

In human-robot collaboration, software-based safety controllers are used to improve operational safety, e.g., by triggering shutdown mechanisms or emergency stops to avoid accidents. Complex robotic tasks and increasingly close human-robot interaction pose new challenges to controller developers and certification authorities. Key among these challenges is the need to assure the correctness of safety controllers under explicit (and preferably weak) assumptions. Our controller synthesis, verification and validation approach is informed by the process, risk analysis, and relevant safety regulations for the target application. Controllers are selected from a design space of feasible controllers according to a set of optimality criteria, are formally verified against correctness criteria, and are translated into executable code and validated in a digital twin. The resulting controller can detect the occurrence of hazards, move the process into a safe state, and, in certain circumstances, return the process to an operational state from which it can resume its original task. We show the effectiveness of our software engineering approach through a case study involving the development of a safety controller for a manufacturing work cell equipped with a collaborative robot.","Gleirscher, Mario; Calinescu, Radu; Douthwaite, James; Lesage, Benjamin; Paterson, Colin; Aitken, Jonathan; Alexander, Rob; Law, James",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06604v1.pdf,569

To get shielded through this war, the world is racing to reach and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to global health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Egypt toward COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledge the determinants of their attitude, and the factors that could increase the acceptance of the vaccine. METHODS: an observational web-based anonymous survey was conducted on 385 Egyptian healthcare workers in different governorates. The questionnaire-based on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Questions of the World Health Organization was available in Arabic and English languages and was tested for reliability. RESULTS: Regarding vaccination decision, 51% of the participants were undecided, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. Reasons for vaccine acceptance mainly were risks of COVID-19 (93%), safety (57.5%), and effectiveness (56.25%) of the vaccine. Simultaneously, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the absence of enough clinical trials (92.4%) and fear of side effects of the vaccine (91.4%). The leading factor that could increase vaccination acceptance among the participants was to get sufficient and accurate information about the available vaccines. The participants revealed a high mean level of concern for COVID-19 vaccines' safety (3.8 of 5) that differs significantly among the different study groups (P-value .002). CONCLUSION: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, only approximately 21% of Egyptian healthcare workers in our study accepted the COVID-19 vaccination.

Methods. PubMed and EMBASE were reviewed between December 1, 2019, and January 31, 2021, and only peer-reviewed clinical studies in our pooled analyses were included. Details regarding the patient numbers, demographics, ocular manifestations, positivity of ocular surface RT-PCR, and severity of pneumonia were recorded from each study. Primary outcomes were the occurrence of ocular manifestations and virus detection on the ocular surface. Meanwhile, secondary outcomes included frequencies of various ocular symptoms/signs (s/s), the proportion of patients with ocular manifestation as the initial symptom, and the relationship between the severity of pneumonia and the presentation of ocular manifestations. Results. In total, 35 studies with 4,432 adult COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis. The overall prevalence rate of ocular manifestations was found to be 11.3%, and the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface was 7.4%. The four most common ocular s/s were follicular conjunctivitis, redness, watering, and discharge. A proportion of 3.3% presented with ocular s/s preceding other findings. Besides, patients with higher severity of pneumonia were more likely to have ocular manifestations (odds ratio = 2.25;95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45–3.50). Conclusion. As per our findings, it was determined that ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be possible, highlighting the importance of eye protective equipment among healthcare personnel.","Chen, Yu-Yen Yen Yung-Feng Huang Li-Ying Chou Pesus",Journal of Ophthalmology,,569

In addition, the mutation of virus strains that have accompanied the pandemic has brought more severe challenges to pandemic control. Host microRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in a variety of biological processes of coronavirus infection, including autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the mechanisms underlying miRNAs involved in autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were investigated based on raw data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, and potential novel biomarkers of autophagy were revealed by bioinformatics analyses. We identified 32 differentially expressed miRNAs and 332 differentially expressed mRNAs in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokine receptor related pathways were the most enriched pathways for differentially expressed miRNAs identified by pathway analysis. Most importantly, an autophagy interaction network, which was associated with the pathological processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially with the cytokine storm, was constructed. In this network, hsa-miR-340-3p, hsa-miR-652-3p, hsa-miR-4772-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, TP53INP2, and CCR2 may be biomarkers that predict changes in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some molecules, including hsa-miR-1291 and CXCR4, were considered potential targets to predict the emergence of severe symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To our knowledge, this study provided the first profile analysis of an autophagy interaction network in SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed several novel autophagy-related biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.","Chen, Zhihao; Wang, Xi; Li, Liubing; Han, Mingxiao; Wang, Min; Li, Ziyuan; Xie, Xiaolu; Du, Hong; Xie, Zonggang; Zhang, Haifang",Microb Pathog,,569

Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics. The proposed model is, therefore, useful for the real-time classification of X-ray chest images of COVID-19 disease.","Dhiman, Gaurav; Vinoth Kumar, V; Kaur, Amandeep; Sharma, Ashutosh",Interdiscip. sci.: comput. life sci.

255331,Telehealth in an acute ophthalmic setting during COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the early impact of COVID-19 on people with self-reported eating disorders. METHOD: Participants in the United States (US, N = 511) and the Netherlands (NL, N = 510), recruited through ongoing studies and social media, completed an online survey that included both quantitative measures and free-text responses assessing the impact of COVID-19 on situational circumstances, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder treatment, and general well-being. RESULTS: Results revealed strong and wide-ranging effects on eating disorder concerns and illness behaviors that were consistent with eating disorder type. Participants with anorexia nervosa (US 62% of sample; NL 69%) reported increased restriction and fears about being able to find foods consistent with their meal plan. Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (US 30% of sample; NL 15%) reported increases in their binge-eating episodes and urges to binge. Respondents noted marked increases in anxiety since 2019 and reported greater concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health than physical health. Although many participants acknowledged and appreciated the transition to telehealth, limitations of this treatment modality for this population were raised. Individuals with past histories of eating disorders noted concerns about relapse related to COVID-19 circumstances. Encouragingly, respondents also noted positive effects including greater connection with family, more time for self-care, and motivation to recover. DISCUSSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with increased anxiety and poses specific disorder-related challenges for individuals with eating disorders that require attention by healthcare professionals and carers.","Termorshuizen, Jet D; Watson, Hunna J; Thornton, Laura M; Borg, Stina; Flatt, Rachael E; MacDermod, Casey M; Harper, Lauren E; van Furth, Eric F; Peat, Christine M; Bulik, Cynthia M",Int J Eat Disord,,569

256057,Reduction in concentration of PM2.5 in India's top most polluted cities: with special reference to post-lockdown period,2021,"PURPOSE: Distance learning, which became widespread in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has been a burdensome challenge for students and lecturers. This study investigated the relationship between academic self-efficacy and burnout in first-year nursing students who participated in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 69 first-year nursing students at Jenderal Achmad Yani University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected in September 2020 through self-efficacy and burnout questionnaires that were distributed via email and social media for 2 weeks. The responses were analyzed using the gamma test. RESULTS: Most respondents were women (78.3%), with an average age of 19 years. Most nursing students had a moderate level of academic self-efficacy (72.5%), while only 13.0% of respondents had a low level of academic self-efficacy. However, 46.4% of students experienced severe burnout during distance learning. Cross-tabulation showed that students with moderate self-efficacy were more likely to experience severe burnout (24 respondents) (P<0.01; and Î³=-0.884). Exhaustion was the burnout dimension most closely associated with academic self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Students perceived distance learning as burdensome and reported high levels of exhaustion, which may negatively impact their academic achievement. Interventions to improve academic self-efficacy may foster students' confidence, potentially leading to reduced burnout levels. Nurse educators should reflect upon innovative learning strategies to create a favorable learning environment for nursing students.","Rohmani, Ngatoiatu; Andriani, Rosi",J Educ Eval Health Prof,,569
256063,Hypertension and predisposition to infection: an important issue during this global pandemic,2020,"RATIONALE: New York City (NYC) was an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States during the spring of 2020 with approximately 203,000 laboratory-confirmed cases reported from March to May of 2020. Jamaica Hospital Medical Center (JHMC) and Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC) are both located in Queens, New York, one of the NYC boroughs with the largest number of COVID-19 cases. While managing COVID-19 patients, we observed an increased prevalence of severe hyperglycemia and DKA in COVID-19 patients with increased insulin requirements. We conducted a study to compare the prevalence of DKA, insulin requirements, and time to resolution of DKA from March 15 to May 15 of 2019 to the same period in 2020. This study will help us better manage these patients during this ongoing pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients aged 18 years and older hospitalized for DKA at JHMC & FHMC between March 15th and May 15th of 2019 and 2020. We looked at age, sex, serum glucose, serum betahydroxybutyrate, steroid use, subcutaneous insulin requirements, time to resolution of DKA, etc., along with clinical notes. Our study was appropriately powered to find a 10 unit increase in daily subcutaneous insulin requirement. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 19.0. Normalcy was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS: The number of DKA cases was 27 in 2019 versus 76 in 2020. Out of those 76 cases, 52 of them were COVID-19 positive. There was an increased use of steroids in patients with COVID-19 and DKA compared to the non-COVID-19 patients with DKA. Despite this, there was no statistically significant difference in time to resolution of DKA or insulin requirements in patients with COVID-19 and DKA identified in our study. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with an increased prevalence of DKA. There is no difference in time to resolution of DKA or insulin requirements in patients with DKA and COVID-19 compared to patients without COVID-19 identified in our study.","Danielson, L.; Allemyar, A.; Pignanelli, M.; Monye, J.; Pinsker, R.; Patel, B.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,569

257041,"The United States, China and the WTO after Coronavirus",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Given the increased use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), chloroquine (CQ), and azithromycin (AZM) during the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a need to evaluate the associated safety concerns. The objective of this study was to summarize the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with HCQ, CQ, and AZM use during the national COVID-19 emergency and compare the results with known adverse reactions listed in the drugs' package inserts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. The publicly available Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System quarterly data extract files from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were downloaded. A disproportionality analysis was conducted using the proportional reporting ratio to identify possible ADE signals. A Poisson regression was used to assess if the number of ADE reports for the 3 drugs increased over time. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increasing trend in the reported ADEs for both HCQ (P < 0.001) and AZM (P < 0.001). Before the declaration of the national emergency, there were 592 reported drug-ADE pairs for the 3 drugs compared with 2492 drug-ADE pairs reported after March 13, 2020. These 2492 drug-ADE pairs represented 848 ADEs across the 3 drugs, of which 114 (13.4%) were identified as potential signals including 55 (48.2%) that were not listed in the prescribing information. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the reported ADEs for HCQ and AZM have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences were observed in both the type of and frequency of the highest reported ADEs for the 3 selected drugs before and after the national emergency declaration. Although causation cannot be determined from ADE reports, further investigation of some reports may be warranted. Our results highlight the need for pharmacovigilance and education of health care professionals on the safety of these drugs when being used for COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment.","Dauner, Daniel G; Dauner, Kim Nichols",,,569

METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that anosmia and ageusia were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, followed by appetite loss and fever. Simultaneous losses of taste and smell but not taste preferences were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.01, odds ratio 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Complete, but not partial, losses of taste and smell were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, healthy persons with sudden simultaneous complete loss of taste and smell should be screened for COVID-19.","Trachootham, Dunyaporn; Thongyen, Supeda; Lam-Ubol, Aroonwan; Chotechuang, Nattida; Pongpirul, Wannarat; Prasithsirikul, Wisit",Int J Infect Dis,,569

258099,Transnational Capital and the Trend of Global Interactions,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt.","Davahli, Mohammad Reza; Fiok, Krzysztof; Karwowski, Waldemar; Aljuaid, Awad M; Taiar, Redha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569

Study Design: Cross sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, from May 2020 to Jun 2020. Methodology: A total of 90 pregnant patients reported in Pak Emirates Military Hospital during the pandemic of COVID-19 with COVID-19 test positive from 01 May 2020 to 30 June 2020. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal and throat swabs. Clinical, analytical, laboratory and radiographic findings were then recorded. The (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 of all the babies who were delivered to these mothers was also done on throat and nasal swabs. The neonatal blood was also sent for serology (IgM/IgG). Results: Out of 90 patients studied, 46 were delivered either through a Caesarean section or by vaginal delivery. The patients were categorized as asymptomatic 51 (55.66%) and symptomatic 39 (43.33%). Out of those symptomatic, patients with mild to moderate disease were 33 (84.61%), patients with severe disease 05 (12.82%) and critically ill patient was 01 (2.56%). All the patients who delivered were COVID-19 test positive at the time of delivery and later when the babies of all these mothers were tested, they were all found to be COVID-19 negative on RT-PCR and no immunoglobulins were found in the serum of these neonates. The possibility for transplacental transmission could only be checked by these two methods (RT-PCR and Serology) since RT-PCR of amniotic fluid, high vaginal swab and breast milk was not available. Conclusion: In our study we did not find any evidence of vertical transmission of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) from infected pregnant mothers to neonates.","Choudry, Abeera Jehan Ara Rafiq Baig Zainab Abbas Mirza Jannat Munawar Ahmed Zeeshan Shafique Mobeen",Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal,,569

259356,Covid-19: UK drops its own contact tracing app to switch to Apple and Google model,2020,"Numerous enveloped viruses use specialized surface molecules called fusogens to enter host cells1. During virus replication, these fusogens decorate the host cells membrane enabling them the ability to fuse with neighboring cells, forming syncytia that the viruses use to propagate while evading the immune system. Many of these viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infect the brain and may cause serious neurological symptoms through mechanisms which remain poorly understood2-4. Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons. Our results provide important mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could affect the nervous system circuitries causing neurological symptoms.","Martinez-Marmol, Ramon; Giordano-Santini, Rosina; Kaulich, Eva; Cho, Ann-Na; Riyadh, Md Asrafuzzaman; Robinson, Emilija; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Meunier, Frederic A; Ke, Yazi D.; Ittner, Lars M; Hilliard, Massimo A",,,569

260366,The continuum of simulator-based maritime training and education,2021,"An understanding of the pathological inflammatory mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is necessary in order to discover new molecular pharmacological targets for SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm. In this study, the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B p65 and I&#954;B&#945;, and I&#954;B&#945; degradation. DNA binding of NF-&#954;B p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11-7082 (1 µM) resulted in inhibition of spike glycoprotein S1-induced NF-&#954;B activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment, produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1ß production. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulated PBMCs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms involving activation of NF-&#954;B, p38 MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome. It is proposed that the clinical benefits of dexamethasone in COVID-19 are possibly due to its anti-inflammatory activity in reducing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm.","Olajide, Olumayokun A; Iwuanyanwu, Victoria U; Lepiarz-Raba, Izabela; Al-Hindawi, Alaa A",Inflammation,,569

This study aimed to assess the psychological outcomes and their influencing factors among medical and non-medical University students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey using structured questionnaires was conducted from February 20 to March 20, 2020. Psychological outcomes were assessed according to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Influencing factors were assessed by COVID-19 knowledge, mindful coping scale, and sense of control scale. Results: Our sample is comprised of 563 University students (male = 172, mean age = 21.52). Among them, 382 are medical students. Among the participants, 12.26, 18.47, and 8.53% have moderate to severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Compared with the non-medical students, the medical students had a higher knowledge level of COVID-19, a higher sense of awareness, and fewer mental health symptoms. After controlling the covariance, perceived constraints of sense of control were negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among both medical and non-medical students. Prevention of negative emotions by mindful coping was negatively associated with depression and anxiety among non-medical students. Knowledge of COVID-19 is not associated with mental distress among medical and non-medical students. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the mental health of University students was affected. Our findings suggested that a sense of control is a protective factor for both medical and non-medical students, while mindful coping is a protective factor for only non-medical students.","Xiong, Peng; Ming, Wai-Kit; Zhang, Caiyun; Bai, Jian; Luo, Chaohua; Cao, Wenyuan; Zhang, Fan; Tao, Qian",Front Public Health,,569

The present study was undertaken to determine the T cell epitopes in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 that dominate the T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. PBMCs from rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein were isolated, and an ELISPOT assay was used to identify the recognized T cell epitopes among a total of 158 18-mer and 10-aa-overlapping peptides spanning the full-length S protein. Six multipeptide-based epitopes located in the S1 region, with four of the six located in the receptor-binding domain, were defined as the most frequently recognized epitopes in macaques. The conservation of the epitopes across species was also verified, and peptide mixtures for T cell response detection were established. Six newly defined T cell epitopes were found in the current study, which may provide a novel potential target for T cell response detection and the diagnosis and vaccine design of SARS-CoV-2 based on multipeptide subunit-based epitopes.","Liu, Xiaojuan; Li, Yuzhong; Xiao, Hongjian; Bi, Yanwei; Gong, Yue; Hu, Zhengrong; Zeng, Yaxin; Sun, Ming; He, Zhanlong; Lu, Shan; Li, Qihan; Cun, Wei",J Immunol,,569

Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. METHODS: Mutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using ""hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019"" as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant. RESULTS: Mutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 3,733 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in ORF3a, NSP3, ORF6 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the ORF3A and in NSP7 proteins. Four out of 22 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that mutations in the viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcome. Our results help to quickly identify SARS-CoV-2 infections harboring mutations related to severe outcome.","Nagy, Ádám; Pongor, Sándor; Gyorffy, Balázs",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,569

We describe the organisational challenges faced in managing the surge and identified risk factors for mortality and ICU admission among hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: All hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 patients diagnosed between March 13 and May 1, 2020, were included. Demographic, referral, deprivation, ethnicity and clinical data were recorded. Multivariable regression, including age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR (95% CI), was used to explore risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Of 257 inpatients, 174 were discharged (68%) and 39 died (15%) in hospital. Two hundred three (79%) patients presented from the community, 34 (13%) from care homes and 20 (8%) were existing inpatients. Forty-five percent of community patients were of a non-Irish White or Black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) population, including 34 Roma (13%) compared to 3% of care home and 5% of existing inpatients, (p < 0.001). Twenty-two patients were healthcare workers (9%). Of 31 patients (12%) requiring ICU admission, 18 were discharged (58%) and 7 died (23%). Being overweight/obese HR (95% CI) 3.09 (1.32, 7.23), p = 0.009; a care home resident 2.68 (1.24, 5.6), p = 0.012; socioeconomically deprived 1.05 (1.01, 1.09), p = 0.012; and older 1.04 (1.01, 1.06), p = 0.002 were significantly associated with death. Non-Irish White or BAME were not significantly associated with death 1.31 (0.28, 6.22), p = 0.63 but were significantly associated with ICU admission 4.38 (1.38, 14.2), p = 0.014 as was being overweight/obese 2.37 (1.37, 6.83), p = 0.01. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented organisational issues for our hospital resulting in the greatest surge in ICU capacity above baseline of any Irish hospital. Being overweight/obese, a care home resident, socioeconomically deprived and older were significantly associated with death, while ethnicity and being overweight/obese were significantly associated with ICU admission.","Farrell, Richard J; O039,; Regan, Rhea; Neill, Eoghan; Bowens, Grainne; Maclellan, Anne; Gileece, Anne; Bradley, Maeve; Smyth, Claire; Kelly, Orlaith; Hall, Barry; Cormican, Liam; Faul, John; Wanic, Krzysztof; McDermott, John; Sreenan, Seamus; Tun, Tommy Kyaw; Duffy, Trevor; Bhatti, Azhar Iqbal; Donohoe, Orla; Leen, Eamon; Collins, Niamh; McGeary, Shane; Cody, Catriona; Dolan, Eamon; Burke, Conor",Ir. j. med. sci,,569
263910,"Critiquing Anthropocentric Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Sport ""Hiatus""",2020,"Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infrequent in children and shows a mortality rate of around 0.08%. This study aims to explore international differences in the pediatric mortality rate. Methods: We analyzed several countries with populations over 5 million that report disaggregated data of COVID-19 deaths by quinquennial or decennial age groups. Data were extracted from COVID-19 cases and deaths by age database, National Ministeries of Health, and the World Health Organization. Results: We included 23 countries in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million children of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4-year-old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation and ranged from 0% (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and pediatric/general COVID mortality correlates strongly with 2018 neonatal mortality (r = 0.77, p < 0.001; and r = 0.88, p < 0.001, respectively), while shows a moderate or no correlation (r = 0.47, p = 0.02; and r = 0.19, p = 0.38, respectively) with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions: International heterogeneity in pediatric COVID-19 mortality importantly parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is a well-known index of the quality of a country's health system, which points to the importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality disparities. This issue should be further explored.","González-García, Nadia; Miranda-Lora, América L; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan; Granados-Riverón, Javier T; Méndez-Galván, Jorge F; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime; Castilla-Peón, Ma Fernanda",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,569

(preprint),2021,"Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a 'Connections Plan' to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during 'social distancing' restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a 'Safety Plan' for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.","Van Orden, Kimberly A; Bower, Emily; Lutz, Julie; Silva, Caroline; Gallegos, Autumn M; Podgorski, Carol A; Santos, Elizabeth J; Conwell, Yeates",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,569

The objective was to compare sublingual microcirculation parameters of critically ill patients according to the severity of the disease. METHODS: The study is a single-center prospective study with critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed by IDF microscopy within 48 hours of ICU admission. Microcirculatory flow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessel (PPV), total vessel density (TVD), De Backer score (DBS), perfused vessel density (PVD) and heterogeneity index (HI) were assessed. Patients were divided in 2 groups (severe and critical) according to the World health organization definition. FINDINGS: From 19th of March to 7th of April 2020, 43 patients were included. Fourteen patients (33%) were in the severe group and twenty-nine patients (67%) in the critical group. Patients in the critical group were all mechanically ventilated. The critical group had significantly higher values of MFI, DBS and PVD in comparison to severe group (respectively, PaCO2: 49 [44-45] vs 36 [33-37] mmHg; p<0,0001, MFI: 2.8 ± 0.2 vs 2.5 ± 0.3; p = 0.001, DBS: 12.7 ± 2.6 vs 10.8 ± 2.0 vessels mm-2; p = 0.033, PVD: 12.5 ± 3.0 vs 10.1 ± 2.4 mm.mm-2; p = 0.020).

268733,Apocalypse Now?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the urology providers' (through a range of training levels) experience utilizing telemedicine given the rapid nationwide implementation of telemedicine in urology practices due to COVID-19. Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the PACT which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in two categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine. Nevertheless, many providers are hesitant to schedule surgery via telemedicine. Providers would benefit from formal training in telemedicine.","Connor, Jessica; Zheng, Yu; Houle, Katherine; Cox, Lindsey",Urology,,569

It is essential to understand the survival ability of the viruses, their adaptation to hosts, and their evolution. The current analysis revealed a high abundance of the relative dinucleotide (odds ratio), GC and CT pairs in the first and last two codon positions, respectively, as well as a low abundance of the CG pair in the last two positions of the codon, which might be related to the evolution of the viruses. A remarkable level of variability of GC content in the third position of the codon among the seven coronaviruses was observed. Codons with high RSCU values are primarily from the aliphatic and hydroxyl amino acid groups, and codons with low RSCU values belong to the aliphatic, cyclic, positively charged, and sulfur-containing amino acid groups. In order to elucidate the evolutionary processes of the seven coronaviruses, a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) was constructed based on the RSCU scores of the codons. The severe and mild categories CoVs were positioned in different clades. A comparative phylogenetic study with other coronaviruses depicted that SARS-CoV-2 is close to the CoV isolated from pangolins (Manis javanica, Pangolin-CoV) and cats (Felis catus, SARS(r)-CoV). Further analysis of the effective number of codon (ENC) usage bias showed a relatively higher bias for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2. The ENC plot against GC3 suggested that the mutational bias might have a role in determining the codon usage variation among candidate viruses. A codon adaptability study on a few human host parasites (from different kingdoms), including CoVs, showed a diverse adaptability pattern. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exhibit relatively lower but similar codon adaptability compared to MERS-CoV.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Roy, Swarup",Genomics,,569

In that sense, this paper presents two main aims developed: the improvement of a virtual navigation system through the results of previous user studies and mixed research (quantitative and qualitative) improved based on the user perception for educational and professional uses. The VR system used is based on Unreal Engine programming of the HTC Vive sensor. This study is related to the GAME4City 3.0 and a broader project focused on gamified visualization and its educational uses in architectural and urban projects. The results reflect great interest, good usability, and high motivation for further usage for all types of users. However, an apparent resistance to deepen its use continues to be perceived in academia. Based on the research results, weak points of educational gamified systems have been identified, and the main differences and needs in user profiles' function. With these data, progress regarding implementing this kind of system at the teaching and professional levels must be pursued.","Fonseca, David; Cavalcanti, Janaina; Peña, Enric; Valls, Victor; Sanchez-Sepúlveda, Mónica; Moreira, Fernando; Navarro, Isidro; Redondo, Ernesto",Sensors (Basel),,569
270414,Courage and leadership in a post-COVID world,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented effort toward the development of an effective and safe vaccine. Aided by extensive research efforts into characterizing and developing countermeasures towards prior coronavirus epidemics, as well as recent developments of diverse vaccine platform technologies, hundreds of vaccine candidates using dozens of delivery vehicles and routes have been proposed and evaluated preclinically. A high demand coupled with massive effort from researchers has led to the advancement of at least 31 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, many using platforms that have never before been approved for use in humans. This review will address the approach and requirements for a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the background of the myriad of vaccine platforms currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 prevention, and a summary of the present results of those trials. It concludes with a perspective on formulation problems which remain to be addressed in COVID-19 vaccine development and antigens or adjuvants which may be worth further investigation.","Batty, Cole J; Heise, Mark T; Bachelder, Eric M; Ainslie, Kristy M",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,,569

A foot that is unable to adjust to the imposed demands during high-intensity sporting activities may alter the moments and forces acting on the joints, increasing the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (ACLR) and lateral ankle sprains (LAS). Prophylactic strengthening programs are often used to reduce the risk of these injuries, but at present, very few prophylactic programs include foot-specific strengthening strategies. The aim of this theoretical review is to ascertain the prophylactic role strengthening muscles acting on the foot may have on ACLR and LAS injury risk. Methods: Literature relating to risk factors associated with ACLR and LAS injury and the anatomy and biomechanics of normal foot function was searched. In addition, ACLR and LAS injury prevention programs were also sought. A theoretical, narrative approach was followed to synthesize the information gathered from the articles. Results: The foot segments are governed by the congruity of the articulations and the activity of the foot muscles. As such, there is a coupling effect between shank, calcaneus, midfoot, and hallux movement which play a role in both ACLR and LAS injury risk. Conclusions: Strengthening the muscles acting on the foot may have a significant impact on ACLR and LAS injury risk.","van der Merwe, Carla; Shultz, Sarah P; Colborne, G Robert; Fink, Philip W",Res Q Exerc Sport,,569

Till now, there is paucity in literature for the management of psychological problems among patients with Covid-19. So we aimed in our study to assess the effect of Yoga and Naturopathy intervention on anxiety and depression of Covid-19 patients. Methods This quasi experimental study was conducted among 130 Covid-19 positive patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital. Yoga and Naturopathic intervention was given for 60 min a day for two weeks. Hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and Corona anxiety scale (CAS) was used to assess the generalized anxiety and depression among the patients. Results Average age of the patients participated was 44 with the range from 36 to 53 years. Among them 85 were male and 45 were female. Of all 130 patients, 33% had symptoms of borderline depression, 9.2% had severe depression, 40% had borderline anxiety and 12.3% had severe anxiety. In CAS, 59 patients (45.38%) reported Covid-19 related dysfunctional anxiety. All the patients showed a significant reduction in the HADS- anxiety (P &lt; 0.01), HADS-depression (p &lt; 0.01) and CAS (p &lt; 0.01) score after the intervention. Conclusion The present study showed significant reduction of anxiety and depression level among the Covid-19 patients. These interventions can be added to the conventional care for better mental and physical wellbeing of the patients after validating the findings with justified study design.","Jenefer Jerrin, R.; Theebika, S.; Panneerselvam, P.; Venkateswaran, S.

DESIGN: Observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (April 13-June 1, 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application (Switzerland) as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those who signed up and those who did not. Similar comparisons were made between patients who complied with the initiative versus those who did not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates and characteristics of patients who were more likely to participate and comply with the initiative. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-two patients (32%) participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 years of age vs. 68 years of age; P < 0.001), men, and living with family. Patients not receiving treatment and those with poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 42%), diabetic retinopathy (35%), retinal vein occlusions (18%), and neovascular AMD (15%; P < 0.001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Patients who complied with the initiative were older, were receiving treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients, with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We provide clinical data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered, participated in, and complied with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared with standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in clinical settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teo, Kelvin Yi Chong; Bachmann, Lucas M; Sim, Dawn; Lee, Shu Yen; Tan, Anna; Wong, Tien Y; Cheung, Chui Ming Gemmy; Wei Tan, Gavin Siew",,,569

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using nationwide Danish registries, we included all patients, aged 18-90 years, receiving a new-onset AF diagnosis during the first 3 months of 2019 and 2020. The main comparison was between patients diagnosed during lockdown (12 March 12-1 April 2020) and patients diagnosed in the corresponding period 1 year previously. We found a lower incidence of new-onset AF during the 3 weeks of lockdown compared with the corresponding weeks in 2019 [incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 3 weeks: 0.66 (0.56-0.78), 0.53 (0.45-0.64), and 0.41 (0.34-0.50)]. There was a 47% drop in total numbers (562 vs. 1053). Patients diagnosed during lockdown were younger and with a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score, while history of cancer, heart failure, and vascular disease were more prevalent. During lockdown, 30 (5.3%) patients with new-onset AF suffered an ischaemic stroke and 15 (2.7%) died, compared with 45 (4.3%) and 14 (1.3%) patients during the corresponding 2019 period, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of a related event (ischaemic stroke or all-cause death) during lock-down compared with the corresponding weeks was 1.41 (95% CI 0.93-2.12). CONCLUSIONS: Following a national lockdown in Denmark, a 47% drop in registered new-onset AF cases was observed. In the event of prolonged or subsequent lockdowns, the risk of undiagnosed AF patients developing complications could potentially translate into poorer outcomes in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Holt, Anders; Gislason, Gunnar H; Schou, Morten; Zareini, Bochra; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Phelps, Matthew; Kragholm, Kristian; Andersson, Charlotte; Fosbøl, Emil L; Hansen, Morten Lock; Gerds, Thomas A; Køber, Lars; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Lamberts, Morten",Eur Heart J,,569

Methods： From January 31, 2020 to February 11, 2020, 70 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated in Bozhou people's hospital were selected. According to the different treatments, they were divided into two groups: 40 patients in combination group and 30 patients in Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule group. Patients in both groups were given routine Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule orally. On this basis, the combination group was given oral Shufeng Jiedu Capsule for 10 d. The antipyretic time and the disappearance time of dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, diarrhea and other symptoms of patients in two groups were compared. The negative conversion ratio and negative conversion time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were also compared between two groups of patients. Results： There were significant differences in antipyretic time, the disappearance time of dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, pharyngeal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and novel coronavirus negative conversion time in the combination treatment group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The negative conversion time of combination treatment group was significantly shorter than Arbidol Hydrochloride Capsule group (P &lt; 0.05).

However, NTBs predominantly exist at academic and/or specialized centers. In addition to increasing centralization throughout the healthcare system, changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have arguably resulted in advantages by conducting clinical meetings virtually. We therefore asked about the experience and acceptance of (virtualized) NTBs and their potential benefits. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via a web-based platform. Specialized neuro-oncological centers in Germany were identified based on the number of brain tumor cases treated in the respective institution per year. Only one representative per center was invited to participate in the survey. Questions targeted the structure/organization of NTBs as well as changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 65/97 institutions participated in the survey (response rate 67%). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, regular conventions of NTBs were maintained by the respective centers and multi-specialty participation remained high. NTBs were considered valuable by respondents in achieving the most optimal therapy for the affected patient and in maintaining/encouraging interdisciplinary debate/exchange. The settings of NTBs have been adapted during the pandemic with the increased use of virtual technology. Virtual NTBs were found to be beneficial, yet administrative support is lacking in some places. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual implementation of NTBs was feasible and accepted in the centers surveyed. Therefore, successful implementation offers new avenues and may be pursued for networking between centers, thereby increasing coverage of neuro-oncology care.","Schäfer, Niklas; Bumes, Elisabeth; Eberle, Fabian; Fox, Viola; Gessler, Florian; Giordano, Frank A; Konczalla, Juergen; Onken, Julia; Ottenhausen, Malte; Scherer, Moritz; Schneider, Matthias; Vatter, Hartmut; Herrlinger, Ulrich; Schuss, Patrick",J Neurooncol,,569

Underscored by the impact of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, 2016 Zika pandemic, 2014 Ebola outbreak, 2001 anthrax letter attacks, and 1984 Rajneeshee Salmonella attacks, the threat of future epidemics/pandemics and/or terrorist/criminal use of pathogenic organisms warrants continued exploration and development of both classic and alternative methods of detecting biothreat agents. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprise a large and highly diverse group of carbon-based molecules, generally related by their volatility at ambient temperature. Recently, the diagnostic potential of VOCs has been realized, as correlations between the microbial VOC metabolome and specific bacterial pathogens have been identified. Herein, we describe the use of microbial VOC profiles as fingerprints for the identification of biothreat-relevant microbes, and for differentiating between a kanamycin susceptible and resistant strain. Additionally, we demonstrate microbial VOC profiling using a rapid-throughput VOC metabolomics method we refer to as 'simultaneous multifiber headspace solid-phase microextraction' (simulti-hSPME).

274804,Evolving Information Systems and Technology Research Issues for COVID-19 and Other Pandemics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Paraneoplastic Cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is one of the classical paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which is characterised by subacute onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia and is usually associated with small cell lung carcinoma, adeno carcinoma of breast and ovary followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: We herein report a case of subacute onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia in a 37-year-old female, who on evaluation was found to have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and experienced good clinical response to treatment. DISCUSSION: As compared to solid tumours, chances of association of PNS with Lymphomas is quite low and there are only few case reports in the literature showing association of PCD with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. As PCD is one of the classical PNS, it is very important to identify subtle cerebellar manifestations in an otherwise apparently normal individual, as early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can immensely improve the mortality and morbidity associated with this syndrome. CONCLUSION: This case signifies the importance of suspecting PNS as an important differential diagnosis in a young patient presenting with subacute onset progressive cerebellar ataxia and evaluating her extensively for malignancy in spite of no paraneoplastic antibody been detected as early diagnosis and treatment can lead to gratifying response. We do agree that 2 weeks follow up is a short time interval to determine whether the response was sustained or not, for which a long term follow up is required.","Nanda, Satyan; Handa, Rahul; Prasad, Atul; Anand, Rajiv; Zutshi, Dhruv; Dass, Sujata K; Bedi, Prabhjeet Kaur; Pahuja, Aarti; Shah, Pankaj Kumar; Sharma, Bipan; Malhotra, Nalin",Neurol. sci,,569

Adults over the age of 18 years (n = 238; 80.2% female) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 3, the Short Form-36 and open-ended questions about PA through an anonymous online survey. Regular exercise was undertaken by 85% of respondents prior to lockdown, but only 49.8% were able to maintain their usual level of PA. Although respondents were considered sufficiently physically active from the IPAQ, 51.5% reported not being able to maintain their usual level of PA primarily due to the closure of their gym facilities. Sixty percent of respondents reported that PA had a positive effect on their overall wellbeing. When asked to specify which aspects of wellbeing were affected, the effect on mental health was reported the most while the effect on body image or fitness was reported the least. Strategies to increase or maintain engagement in physical activity during lockdowns should be encouraged to promote positive mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Meiring, Rebecca M; Gusso, Silmara; McCullough, Eloise; Bradnam, Lynley",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569
275910,Communication in a Crisis and the Importance of Authenticity and Transparency,2021,"In the nursing home in B&#345;evnice, 21 out of 23 seniors were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the spring of 2020. Three of them died from the infection. This study monitors the antibodies formation in group of seniors who have overcome the infection. Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA). Six months from the infection, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 18 out of 20 seniors. High levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with higher levels of immunoglobulins and were a good predictor of an increase of IgG in the autumn during the second wave of the epidemic in the Czech Republic. During the autumn wave, neither any of the clients, nor any staff contracted the virus, although the prevalence of PCR positivity in the Vyso&#269;ina region reached around 5 %. The antigen tests also came out all negative. This study shows that in the senior population, the production of protective antibodies follows a normal pattern, and the seniors are probably immune to a repeated infection for at least 8 months from the first infection. Based on these results, we would like to open the discussion on the testing for seroprevalence in nursing homes, possible changes to the epidemiologic regime in relation to the risk of infection, and about vaccination schemes in these centers.","Fejt, Václav; Krátká, Zuzana; Zelená, Hana; Fürst, Tomás",Cas Lek Cesk,,569
276360,Years of life lost to COVID-19 in 81 countries,2021,"Circulating animal coronaviruses occasionally infect humans. The SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 2 112 844 deaths as of late January 2021. We compared genetic code preferences in 496 viruses, including 34 coronaviruses and 242 corresponding hosts, to uncover patterns that distinguish single- and 'promiscuous' multiple-host-infecting viruses. Based on a codon usage preference score, promiscuous viruses were shown to significantly employ nonoptimal codons, namely codons that involve 'wobble' binding to anticodons, as compared to single-host viruses. The codon adaptation index (CAI) and the effective number of codons (ENC) were calculated for all viruses and hosts. Promiscuous viruses were less adapted hosts vs single-host viruses (P-value = 4.392e-11). All coronaviruses exploit nonoptimal codons to infect multiple hosts. We found that nonoptimal codon preferences at the beginning of viral coding sequences enhance the translational efficiency of viral proteins within the host. Finally, coronaviruses lack endogenous RNA degradation motifs to a significant degree, thereby increasing viral mRNA burden and infection load. To conclude, we found that promiscuously infecting coronaviruses prefer nonoptimal codon usage to remove degradation motifs from their RNAs and to dramatically increase their viral RNA production rates.","Carmi, Gon; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Mukherjee, Sumit; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",FEBS j,,569
276468,Trust in the European Union project and the role of ECB,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To compare epidemiologic features of the second and third waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. METHODS: Nationwide COVID-19 data were collected between 6 May and 30 December 2020. The degree of social activity was estimated using an Internet search trend analysis program for leisure-related keywords, including 'eating-out', 'trip' and 'get directions' (transportation). Demographics, transmission chains, case fatality rates, social activity levels and public health responses were compared between the second (13 August-18 September 2020) and third (4 November 2020-present) waves. RESULTS: In comparison with the second wave, the third wave was characterized by delayed strengthening of social distancing policies (3 vs. 15 days), longer duration (36 vs. >56 days) and a higher case fatality rate (0.91% vs. 1.26%). There were significant differences in transmission chains between the second and third waves (P < 0.01). In comparison with the second wave, the proportion of local clusters (24.8% vs. 45.7%) was lower in the third wave, and personal contact transmission (38.5% vs. 25.9%) and unknown routes of transmission (23.5% vs. 20.8%) were higher in the third wave. CONCLUSION: Early and timely interventions with strengthened social distancing policies should be implemented to suppress and control the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.","Seong, Hye; Hyun, Hak Jun; Yun, Jin Gu; Noh, Ji Yun; Cheong, Hee Jin; Kim, Woo Joo; Song, Joon Young",Int J Infect Dis,,569
277113,Distant English Teaching to Deaf and Hard Of Hearing Students: A Case Study of Bauman Moscow State Technical University,2021,"COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1-6. Although pathological innate immune activation is well-documented in severe disease1, the effect of autoantibodies on disease progression is less well-defined. Here we use a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique known as rapid extracellular antigen profiling7 to screen a cohort of 194 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, comprising 172 patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthcare workers with mild disease or asymptomatic infection, for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (members of the exoproteome). We found that patients with COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivities as compared to uninfected individuals, and show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell-surface proteins). We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signalling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that mouse surrogates of these autoantibodies increase disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics. Our findings suggest a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19, with diverse effects on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.","Wang, Eric Y; Mao, Tianyang; Klein, Jon; Dai, Yile; Huck, John D; Jaycox, Jillian R; Liu, Feimei; Zhou, Ting; Israelow, Benjamin; Wong, Patrick; Coppi, Andreas; Lucas, Carolina; Silva, Julio; Oh, Ji Eun; Song, Eric; Perotti, Emily S; Zheng, Neil S; Fischer, Suzanne; Campbell, Melissa; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Vogels, Chantal B F; Ott, Isabel M; Kalinich, Chaney C; Petrone, Mary E; Watkins, Anne E; Dela Cruz, Charles; Farhadian, Shelli F; Schulz, Wade L; Ma, Shuangge; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Ko, Albert I; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ring, Aaron M",Nature,,569

277939,"David Hayes, Confronting Penal Excess",2020,"Amino acid mutations that improve protein stability and rigidity can accompany increases in binding affinity. Therefore, conserved amino acids located on a protein surface may be successfully targeted by antibodies. The quantitative deep mutational scanning approach is an excellent technique to understand viral evolution, and the obtained data can be utilized to develop a vaccine. However, the application of the approach to all of the proteins in general is difficult in terms of cost. To address this need, we report the construction of a deep neural network-based program for sequence-based prediction of supersecondary structure codes (SSSCs), called SSSCPrediction (SSSCPred). Further, to predict conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins, a comparison program called SSSCPreds that consists of three deep neural network-based prediction systems (SSSCPred, SSSCPred100, and SSSCPred200) has also been developed. Using our algorithms we calculated here shows the degree of flexibility for the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the rigidity of the unique motif (SSSC: SSSHSSHHHH) at the S2 subunit and has a value independent of the X-ray and Cryo-EM structures. The fact that the sequence flexibility/rigidity map of SARS-CoV-2 RBD resembles the sequence-to-phenotype maps of ACE2-binding affinity and expression, which were experimentally obtained by deep mutational scanning, suggests that the identical SSSC sequences among the ones predicted by three deep neural network-based systems correlate well with the sequences with both lower ACE2-binding affinity and lower expression. The combined analysis of predicted and observed SSSCs with keyword-tagged datasets would be helpful in understanding the structural correlation to the examined system.","Izumi, Hiroshi; Nafie, Laurence A; Dukor, Rina K",ACS Omega,,569

Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention were performed, subgrouped by design, setting, face barrier type, and who wore the mask. Preferred outcome was influenza-like illness. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) quality assessment was undertaken and evidence base deficits described.Results33 studies (12 randomised control trials (RCTs)) were included. Mask wearing reduced primary infection by 6% (odds ratio (OR): 0.94; 95% CI: 0.75-1.19 for RCTs) to 61% (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.32-2.27; OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.84 and OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.45-0.85 for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies respectively). RCTs suggested lowest secondary attack rates when both well and ill household members wore masks (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.48-1.37). While RCTs might underestimate effects due to poor compliance and controls wearing masks, observational studies likely overestimate effects, as mask wearing might be associated with other risk-averse behaviours. GRADE was low or very low quality.ConclusionWearing face masks may reduce primary respiratory infection risk, probably by 6-15%. It is important to balance evidence from RCTs and observational studies when their conclusions widely differ and both are at risk of significant bias.

279875,How Laws Affect the Perception of Norms: Empirical Evidence from the Lockdown,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly associated with negative outcomes (i.e., serious disease, death) in frail older people, independently of where they live. Furthermore, the period of pandemic (with its lockdowns, social distancing, fragmentation of care ) has significantly changed the environment in which older people live. It is likely that, when the pandemic will be over, an acceleration of the aging process will be observed for many persons, independently of whether they have been infected or not by the SARS-CoV-2. The World report on ageing and health, published by the World Health Organization, proposes the concept of intrinsic capacity (i.e., the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of the individual) as central for healthy ageing. The routine assessment of biological age through constructs such as intrinsic capacity might have allowed a better understanding of the functional trajectories and vulnerabilities of the individual, even during a catastrophic event as the one we are currently living. In the present article, we describe how COVID-19 has affected the persons' intrinsic capacity, and how the wide adoption of the intrinsic capacity model may support the modernization of our systems and bring them closer to the individual.","Nestola, T; Orlandini, L; Beard, J R; Cesari, M",J Nutr Health Aging,,569

Methods: This study employed a quantitative comparative-correlational approach. Using the snowball sampling technique, we conducted this study involving 176 frontline nurses from hospitals of the Hail region, KSA. Results: The frontline nurses showed high perceived infectability (x = 4.36) and germ aversion (x = 5.65) but were moderately stressed (19.19). Of the examined variables, only years of experience resulted in significant differences in germ aversion (F [3] = 8.980, p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in perceived infectability and stress. Perceived infectability (r = -0.152, p < 0.05) and germ aversion (r = 0.007, p > 0.05) were negatively correlated to perceived stress. Conclusion: In this study, frontline nurses perceived moderate to high stress vulnerability to COVID-19. There were significant differences in germ aversion based on the duration of experience. It is noteworthy that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 did not impact stress. Paying attention to concerns of nurses can potentially improve preventive practices and positive behaviours in combating the pandemic.","Pasay-An, Eddieson",,,569

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.","Hou, Deyi; Bolan, Nanthi S; Tsang, Daniel C W; Kirkham, Mary B; O039,; Connor, David",Sci Total Environ,,569
280984,The effect of minimum wages on consumption in Canada,2020,"Background: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. Recently, international agencies have revealed that poverty and hunger could kill more people than COVID-19 victims. Many global workforces have lost their jobs during this pandemic situation. In developing countries, most of the workers and their families live hand to mouth, depending on daily wage, and loss of income would be a hunger pandemic. Globally, the proportion of undernourished and hungry people have been on an upswing due to climate changes and violent conflicts. The millions of people are facing chronic malnourishment and COVID-19 menaces undermining the endeavour of philanthropic and food security. COVID-19 has increased the risk of livelihood by the shortage of food and distraction of the supply chain especially in the developing countries where rural expanses depend on agriculture production and seasonal jobs. So, if they are forced to limit their activities, their livelihoods will be demolished. Scope and approach: COVID-19 is increasing the jeopardy of food prices over the world, which would prompt a crisis in several developing countries. The government organizations in developing countries are doing well to protect people from the current pandemic. But they are also in critical situation regarding food supply chains and are facing difficulties in providing nutrient-rich foods. The susceptible people are fraught to secure household income and manage their food. In this review, we have explored the food security approach, food supply chain and risk of food shortage. Every country in the world needs to implement effective interventions to maintain open trade and food supply chains, ensure access to nutrients for all at affordable prices and develop co-operation to preserve the flexibility of universal food markets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Rahaman, A.; Kumari, A.; Zeng, X.

Objective: To describe individuals' concerns regarding violence in the context of the pandemic, experiences of pandemic-related unfair treatment, prevalence of and reasons for firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, a probability-based internet survey of California adults conducted from July 14 to 27, 2020. Respondents came from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, an online research panel with members selected using address-based sampling methods. Responses were weighted to be representative of the adult population of California. Main Outcomes and Measures: Topics included worry about violence for oneself before and during the pandemic; concern about violence for someone else due to a pandemic-related loss; experiences of unfair treatment attributed to the pandemic; firearm and ammunition acquisition due to the pandemic; and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic. Results: Of 5018 invited panel members, 2870 completed the survey (completion rate, 57%). Among respondents (52.3% [95% CI, 49.5%-55.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [16.9] years; 41.9% [95% CI, 39.3%-44.6%] White individuals), self-reported worry about violence for oneself was significantly higher during the pandemic for all violence types except mass shootings, ranging from a 2.8 percentage point increase for robbery (from 65.5% [95% CI, 62.8%-68.0%] to 68.2% [95% CI, 65.6%-70.7%]; P = .008) to a 5.6 percentage point increase for stray bullet shootings (from 44.5% [95% CI, 41.7%-47.3%] to 50.0% [47.3%-52.8%]; P < .001). The percentage of respondents concerned that someone they know might intentionally harm themselves was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.5%-15.3%). Of those, 7.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-12.2%) said it was because the other person had experienced a pandemic-related loss. An estimated 110â¯000 individuals (2.4% [95% CI, 1.1%-5.0%] of firearm owners in the state) acquired a firearm due to the pandemic, including 47â¯000 new owners (43.0% [95% CI, 14.8%-76.6%] of those who had acquired a firearm). Of owners who stored at least 1 firearm in the least secure way, 6.7% (95% CI, 2.7%-15.6%) said they had adopted this unsecure storage practice in response to the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of findings from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in self-reported worry about violence for oneself and others, increased firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices. Given the impulsive nature of many types of violence, short-term crisis interventions may be critical for reducing violence-related harm.","Kravitz-Wirtz, Nicole; Aubel, Amanda; Schleimer, Julia; Pallin, Rocco; Wintemute, Garen",JAMA Netw Open,,569

Despite its growing evidence, there is a need to unravel the complex learning process in order to ensure high quality of interprofessional education delivery. AIM: This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare students and facilitators on the use of 3DVW for interprofessional team-based virtual simulation. METHODS: Interprofessional teams, each comprising six different healthcare students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) and two clinicians who acted as facilitators, logged into the 3DVW from their own remote locations to participate in team-based care delivery that included an interprofessional bedside round and a family conference. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted on a purposive sample of 30 healthcare students and 12 facilitators using focus group discussions and individual interviews. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from their experiences: the ""wow experience"", authentic experience on collaborative care, ease of learning, and preeminent role of the facilitator. The simulation provided the ""wow"" experiences through contextual, collaborative and experiential learning approaches. Despite technical challenges, the participants were wooed by the comforts of learning from home and the psychological safety in virtual environment. The facilitators played a critical role in optimizing learning engagement to win learners over. CONCLUSION: Our study explicates how attention to the ""wow, woo and win"" trilateral factors can transform the interprofessional learning experiences offered by 3DVW simulation. Future developments in the use of this learning technology should include developing the clinicians' facilitation skills and the provision of technical support to make this 3DVW a success calls in winning students' learning engagement.","Liaw, Sok Ying; Choo, Tingwei; Wu, Ling Ting; Lim, Wee Shiong; Choo, Hyekyung; Lim, Sok Mui; Ringsted, Charlotte; Wong, Lai Fun; Ooi, Sim Leng; Lau, Tang Ching",Nurse Educ Today,,569
283906,U.s. Policy Options toward China: an Appraisal,2020,"Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) is an effective and convenient treatment for cancer-related anaemia. In our study for the first time, we evaluated the effect of simultaneous use of Epo and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor LFM-A13 on the viability and tumour development of breast cancer cells. The results demonstrated that Epo significantly intensifies the anticancer activity of LFM-A13 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The featured therapeutic scheme efficiently blocked the tumour development in zebrafish experimental cancer model. Epo and LFM-A13 administered together resulted in effective cell killing, accompanied by attenuation of the BTK signalling pathways, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), accumulation of apoptotic breast cancer cells with externalised PS, a slight increase in phase G0/G1 and a reduction in cyclin D1 expression. Simultaneous use of Epo with LFM-A13 inhibited early stages of tumour progression. This therapeutic scheme may be rationale for further possible research.","Rozkiewicz, Dariusz; Hermanowicz, Justyna Magdalena; Tankiewicz-Kwedlo, Anna; Sieklucka, Beata; Pawlak, Krystyna; Czarnomysy, Robert; Bielawski, Krzysztof; Surazynski, Arkadiusz; Kalafut, Joanna; Przybyszewska, Alicja; Koda, Mariusz; Jakubowska, Katarzyna; Rivero-Muller, Adolfo; Pawlak, Dariusz",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,,569

285038,"Human resource management and the COVID-19 crisis: Implications, challenges, opportunities, and future organizational directions",2021,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers. We recommend mitigation of the collateral impact of lockdowns with interventions that focus on improving policing quality, ensuring continuity of essential services, and strengthening support systems for vulnerable groups including males.","Katana, Elizabeth; Amodan, Bob Omoda; Bulage, Lilian; Ario, Alex R; Fodjo, Joseph Nelson Siewe; Colebunders, Robert; Wanyenze, Rhoda K",BMC Public Health,,569

The discussion focuses on potential explanatory elements These relate essentially to the way the scenarios were produced, notably in terms of time horizon, explanation of the methods and selection of the variables structuring the scenarios These elements seem to indicate that these scenarios were rather generated from a reactive posture, showing a reluctance to rethink the present as a moment of discontinuity opening up the horizon of possibilities This initial work paves the way for a more systematic exploration of the practice of anticipation and the capacity to produce creative/imaginative futures in times of crisis","Jahel, Camille Bourgeois Robin Pesche Denis de Lattre-Gasquet Marie Delay Etienne",FUTURES &amp; FORESIGHT SCIENCE,,569

286137,Impact of lockdown on agriculture and allied sector in Washim district,2020,"Dental professionals work closely with patients and present an increased risk of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the use of ultrasonic scalers, air-water syringes, and slow and high-speed handpieces, which are common in the dental office, generate spatter and aerosol. The use of preprocedural mouthrinses has been proposed to reduce the viral load in saliva and oropharyngeal tissues, thus decreasing viral load in dental aerosol. Although some mouthrinses demonstrates an antiviral effect, there is limited evidence about the clinical efficacy of any mouthrinse in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the dental aerosol. We hypothesized that mouthrinses may reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the oropharynx and its fluids reducing viral load in dental aerosol. The potential use of mouthrinses is discussed, along with proposal of in vitro and clinical studies, in order to evaluate this hypothesis. If this hypothesis holds true, dental professionals and patients may benefit from the routine use of preprocedural mouthrinses.","Reis, Isabella Neme Ribeiro; do Amaral, Guilherme Castro Lima Silva; Mendoza, Aldrin André Huamán; das Graças, Yasmin Teixeira; Mendes-Correa, Maria Cássia; Romito, Giuseppe Alexandre; Pannuti, Claudio Mendes",Med Hypotheses,,569

By investigating 17 acute and 24 convalescent patients, we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in broad immune cell reduction including T, natural killer, monocyte, and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were significantly reduced with functional impairment, and ratios of conventional DCs to plasmacytoid DCs were increased among acute severe patients. Besides lymphocytopenia, although neutralizing antibodies were rapidly and abundantly generated in patients, there were delayed receptor binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific T cell responses during the first 3 weeks after symptoms onset. Moreover, acute RBD- and NP-specific T cell responses included relatively more CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells. Our findings provided evidence that impaired DCs, together with timely inverted strong antibody but weak CD8 T cell responses, could contribute to acute COVID-19 pathogenesis and have implications for vaccine development.","Zhou, Runhong; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Wong, Yik-Chun; Liu, Li; Zhou, Biao; Li, Xin; Huang, Haode; Mo, Yufei; Luk, Tsz-Yat; Lau, Thomas Tsz-Kan; Yeung, Pauline; Chan, Wai-Ming; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Leung, Wai-Shing; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",Immunity,,569

In this study, we compared the incidence curves of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in different countries and reported the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in our institute, as well as the kinetics and sources of the infections. We used mortality collected from a COVID-19 data repository for 221 countries. Viral variants were defined based on [≥]5 hallmark mutations shared by [≥]30 genomes. SARS-CoV-2 genotype was determined for 24,181 patients using next-generation genome and gene sequencing (in 47% and 11% of cases, respectively) or variant-specific qPCR (in 42% of cases). Sixteen variants were identified by analysing viral genomes from 9,788 SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed patients. Our data show that since the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic episode in Marseille, importation through travel from abroad was documented for seven of the new variants. In addition, for the B.1.160 variant of Pangolin classification (a.k.a. Marseille-4), we suspect transmission from mink farms. In conclusion, we observed that the successive epidemic peaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not linked to rebounds of viral genotypes that are already present but to newly-introduced variants. We thus suggest that border control is the best mean of combating this type of introduction, and that intensive control of mink farms is also necessary to prevent the emergence of new variants generated in this animal reservoir.","Colson, Philippe; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Chaudet, Herve; Delerce, Jeremy; GIRAUD-GATINEAU, Audrey; HOUHAMDI, Linda; ANDRIEU, Claudia; BRECHARD, Ludivine; BEDOTTO, Marielle; PRUDENT, Elsa; GAZIN, Celine; BEYE, Mamadou; BUREL, Emilie; DUDOUET, Pierre; TISSOT-DUPONT, Herve; GAUTRET, Philippe; LAGIER, Jean-Christophe; MILLION, Matthieu; BROUQUI, Philippe; Parola, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; SCOLA, Bernard LA; LEVASSEUR, Anthony; Raoult, Didier",,,569
288421,Free utility model for explaining the social gravity law,2020-09-17,"The aim of our study was to gather information on how people with epilepsy (PwE) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic during the national lockdown. An online questionnaire was therefore offered to the visitors of the Croatian Association for Epilepsy's website. The 22-items questionnaire was designed to acquire information from adults with epilepsy living in Croatia on demographic data, cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic, and communication problems between patients and their neurologists during the lockdown. Perceived anxiety and fears were expressed with the Likert scale (1-5) and the results of specific fears added to make the Total Fear Score. Results: Out of 186 respondents in total, only 2.8% did not comply with the lockdown measures, and all of those respondents stated that they did not feel any anxiety related to COVID-19. A canceled neurologist examination during the lockdown was significantly associated with pandemic-related anxiety (2.9â¯±â¯1.28 vs. 2.3â¯±â¯1.19, Uâ¯=â¯3039, pâ¯=â¯0.001) and fears (Total Fear Score 31.4â¯±â¯9.70 vs. 28.4â¯±â¯9.79, Uâ¯=â¯3341, pâ¯=â¯0.036), and 87.4% of respondents expressed the wish to communicate with their neurologist, either by phone/video call (53.0%) or email (34.4%). Conclusion: We think the results of our survey show that the responses from PwE point to a social responsibility appropriate for the existing situation. During future pandemics, telemedicine could have an important role in tackling the fears and anxieties caused by the cancelation of examinations, which corresponds to the wishes expressed by the great majority of our respondents.","Friedrich, Latica; Sruk, Ana; Bielen, Ivan",Epilepsy Behav,,569

We examine risk for co-infection among construction and agricultural workers, incarcerated persons, Black and Latino populations, and persons living in high dust areas. We further identify common risk factors for co-infection, including older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, racial or ethnic minority status, and smoking. Because these diseases cause similar symptoms, the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis, potentially interfering with prompt administration of antifungal therapies. Finally, we examine the clinical implications of co-infection, including severe COVID-19 and reactivation of latent coccidioidomycosis. Physicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a possible diagnosis when treating patients with respiratory symptoms. Preventive measures such as wearing face masks might mitigate exposure to dust and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, thereby protecting against both infections.","Heaney, Alexandra K; Head, Jennifer R; Broen, Kelly; Click, Karen; Taylor, John; Balmes, John R; Zelner, Jon; Remais, Justin V",Emerg Infect Dis,,569

Specifically, this paper examines exposure to COVID-19 information and its relationship with panic buying directly, indirectly through anxiety and as moderated by resilience.Design/methodology/approachIn the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study surveys 1,006 Muslims from a sample of 1,392 UAE citizens and residents about their exposure to COVID-19 information, anxiety, resilience and panic buying.FindingsGreater exposure to COVID-19 information had a direct effect on panic buying yet a much weaker indirect effect through increased anxiety. This mediating effect is only significant at moderate to high levels of resilience, suggesting panic buying is a particular coping response of resilient individuals who experience anxiety after greater exposure to COVID-19 information. Anxiety was found to increase panic buying above that directly related to COVID-19 information exposure.Social implicationsFindings provide some guidance for policymakers where a nuanced approach to building and directing resilience and in directing information flows are needed to curtail panic buying within their Muslim populations.Originality/valueWhile the phenomenon of consumer stockpiling is referred to as panic buying, the findings suggest that anxiety plays a smaller role in the process than preparedness prompted by crisis-related information exposure. Furthermore, this is the first study to date to specifically examine COVID-19 related panic buying among a Muslim population.","Sherman, Claire Eloise Arthur Damien Thomas Justin",Journal of Islamic Marketing,,569

291469,Precarity: Modeling the Long Term Effects of Compounded Decisions on Individual Instability,2021-04-24,"Mental health issues not only affect the person but society as a whole. This is especially apparent during times of pandemics or other social unrest situations as currently seen during the COVID-19 crisis. It can manifest itself as violence (towards or from the mentally ill person), increased substance use, increased overcrowding of our prisons, tackling with comorbid medical conditions which have worsened due to lack of initial attention (a particularly big problem among the mentally ill), increased strain on tax payers, and overall affecting the quality of everyone's life. Furthermore, mental health maladies can cause increase work absenteeism and poor work performance and decreased economic productivity. The stigma associated with mental health also leads to poor funding form policy makers, as there is a lack of forceful advocacy in dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the loss of productivity due to mental health disability accounts to close to 5% of the gross national product of the European Union (WHO 2019). One of the most crucial causes of lack of mental screening, recognition, and treatment is the limited availability of mental health trained providers. The physician assistant profession is in a unique role to fill this niche as they have been trained as generalists who specialize only when getting trained in their specific field during their employment. Additionally, the fact that PAs do have lateral mobility does lend this profession to meet the needs of society, especially in the psychiatric fields, in a prompt and competent manner. The need for physician assistants (PAs) in psychiatry and addiction medicine is a nationwide trend resulting in existing and emerging shortages of psychiatric and addiction medicine providers. They can provide relatively inexpensive, easily accessible, and good quality care to their clients.","Kuriakose, Shinu",SN Compr Clin Med,,569

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT.

We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method is used to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner, and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover, for the two cancer datasets, Core&Peel detects further eight relevant pathways not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally, we apply Core&Peel and other methods to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts at a pre-clinical level.","Lucchetta, Marta; Pellegrini, Marco",Sci Rep,,569
292625,Learning From Excess Pandemic Deaths,2021,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards the human respiratory tract. First, the S proteins exhibit an intrinsic temperature preference, corresponding with the temperature of the upper or lower airways. Pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) were more infectious when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C, a property shared with the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with virus preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S-driven entry was efficiently activated by not only TMPRSS2, but also the TMPRSS13 protease, thus broadening the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Both proteases proved relevant in the context of authentic virus replication. TMPRSS13 appeared an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the low pathogenic HCoV-229E virus. Activation of SARS-2-S by these surface proteases requires processing of the S1/S2 cleavage loop, in which both the furin recognition motif and extended loop length proved critical. Conversely, entry of loop deletion mutants is significantly increased in cathepsin-rich cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the D614G mutation increases SARS-CoV-2 stability, particularly at 37°C, and, enhances its use of the cathepsin L pathway. This indicates a link between S protein stability and usage of this alternative route for virus entry. Since these spike properties may promote virus spread, they potentially explain why the spike-G614 variant has replaced the early D614 variant to become globally predominant. Collectively, our findings reveal adaptive mechanisms whereby the coronavirus spike protein is adjusted to match the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology.","Laporte, Manon; Raeymaekers, Valerie; Van Berwaer, Ria; Vandeput, Julie; Marchand-Casas, Isabel; Thibaut, Hendrik-Jan; Van Looveren, Dominique; Martens, Katleen; Hoffmann, Markus; Maes, Piet; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Naesens, Lieve; Stevaert, Annelies",PLoS Pathog,,569

In these more than 40 years of existence, these cohorts have been able to document the increase in women's education, the improvement of health conditions, the creation of a public Unified Health System (SUS) that provides universal and free access to health care, eradication of hunger, and transition of the nutritional status characterized by a decrease in malnutrition rates and an increase in obesity in Brazil. Particularly in reproductive health, the country experienced a significant drop in fertility, a decrease in maternal and child mortality, and an increase in breastfeeding rates. Universal access to prenatal care and hospital delivery was accompanied by an excessive number of cesareans without clinical indication and early-term births and premature births, largely due to scheduled cesareans. Articles with a longitudinal and transversal methodological approach are presented, using structural equation analysis and propensity score, together with multivariate regressions, which gave a robust analytical treatment to articles in this thematic issue.","Leal, M.

294063,Why a pandemic recession boosts asset prices,2021,"The adversarial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has created a health crisis globally all over the world. This unprecedented crisis forced people to lockdown and changed almost every aspect of the regular activities of the people. Thus, the pandemic is also impacting everyone physically, mentally, and economically, and it, therefore, is paramount to analyze and understand emotional responses during the crisis affecting mental health. Negative emotional responses at fine-grained labels like anger and fear during the crisis might also lead to irreversible socio-economic damages. In this work, we develop a neural network model and train it using manually labeled data to detect various emotions at fine-grained labels in the Covid-19 tweets automatically. We present a manually labeled tweets dataset on COVID-19 emotional responses along with regular tweets data. We created a custom Q&A roBERTa model to extract phrases from the tweets that are primarily responsible for the corresponding emotions. None of the existing datasets and work currently provide the selected words or phrases denoting the reason for the corresponding emotions. Our classification model outperforms other systems and achieves a Jaccard score of 0.6475 with an accuracy of 0.8951. The custom RoBERTa Q&A model outperforms other models by achieving a Jaccard score of 0.7865.

As farm, performance, and companion animals, horses are a unique species from a zoonotic disease risk perspective, and the risks of subclinical infections spreading among horses can pose challenges. Using a nanoscale real-time PCR platform, we investigated the prevalence of 14 enteric pathogens, 11 Escherichia coli genes, and 9 respiratory pathogens in fecal samples from 97 apparently healthy horses at a multi-day horse event. In addition, sugar flotation test was performed for fecal parasites. E. coli f17 was commonly detected, prevalent in 59% of horses, followed closely by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (55%). Additional pathogens recognized included betacoronavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Cryptosporidium sp., E. coli O157, equine adenovirus 1, equine rhinitis B virus, and others. The use of PCR data may overestimate the true prevalence of these pathogens but provides a sensitive overview of common pathogens present in healthy horses. Our results prompt the continued need for practical biosecurity measures at horse shows, both to protect individuals interacting with these horses and to minimize transmission among horses.","Stout, Alison E; Hofmar-Glennon, Hayley G; André, Nicole M; Goodman, Laura B; Anderson, Renee R; Mitchell, Patrick K; Thompson, Belinda S; Lejeune, Manigandan; Whittaker, Gary R; Goodrich, Erin L",J Vet Diagn Invest,,569

These sudden shifts bring up questions about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on already fragile rural health care systems and the ability of rural populations, including farmers and farm workers, to meet their health care needs. To provide alternative and safe access to health care, the Federal government relaxed telehealth regulations, which effectively removed some of the largest regulatory barriers that had limited the adoption of telehealth in the U.S. In this commentary, we draw on the example of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), a large rural health care system in Wisconsin and provide an early assessment of how it adjusted its telehealth services during the early months of COVID-19. While the long-term effects of the pandemic on rural health care systems will not be known for some time, the example of MCHS points to the importance of on-going and sustained investments to support the resilience of health care systems and their ability to weather crises. With early evidence that MCHS patients and practitioners are interested in continuing to use telehealth post-COVID-19, we conclude our commentary by offering three recommendations to remove hurdles and improve quality of telehealth care.","Meyer, Chris; Becot, Florence; Burke, Rick; Weichelt, Bryan",J Agromedicine,,569

Automatic extraction of such patterns benefits several downstream tasks, including, entity extraction, ontology building, and question answering. Unfortunately, automatic extraction of such patterns has not yet received much attention from NLP and information retrieval researchers. In this work, we propose an attention-based supervised deep learning model, ASPER, which extracts syntactic patterns between entities exhibiting a given semantic relation in the sentential context. We validate the performance of ASPER on three distinct semantic relations -- hyponym-hypernym, cause-effect, and meronym-holonym on six datasets. Experimental results show that for all these semantic relations, ASPER can automatically identify a collection of syntactic patterns reflecting the existence of such a relation between a pair of entities in a sentence. In comparison to the existing methodologies of syntactic pattern extraction, ASPER's performance is substantially superior.","Kabir, Md.

The highly conservatives amino acids were analyzed its B cell linear and continuous epitopes and T cell epitopes. Results: From the alignment results it was found that there is a highly conserved region in the extracellular domain of spike protein. With prediction methods from this highly conserved region, B cell and T cell epitopes from spike protein were derived. Conclusion: From several different prediction results, B cell epitope and T cell epitope were identified in the highly conserved region thus it is promising to be developed as a coronavirus vaccine candidate.","Yurina, Valentina",Clin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative influences of circumstantial, demographic, and trait-state anxiety variables on health anxiety in this group. METHODS: A total of 168 hospital staff members (mean age: 28.91 years; 56.5% females) participated in the study. They completed a series of questionnaires covering sociodemographic characteristics, health anxiety, state-trait anxiety, and job-related information. Participants also reported whether they had close acquaintances (friends, family members) infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: Higher health anxiety was related to both trait and state anxiety. Working on the frontline, being in contact with close acquaintances infected with COVID-19, and higher state and trait anxiety predicted higher health anxiety. Gender, age, and educational background were not predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of hospital staff, subjective feelings of anxiety about one own's health were related to personality traits, individual experiences of having close acquaintances infected with COVID-19, and working on the frontline.","Shayganfard, Mehran; Mahdavi, Fateme; Haghighi, Mohammad; Sadeghi-Bahmani, Dena; Brand, Serge",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569

Some studies report an increased frequency of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients. This review aims to describe the risk of infection and developing severe COVID-19 in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was carried out through an exhaustive search of literature in PubMed and Scopus until May 2020. A secondary search was performed to include more studies. RESULTS: The initial search identified 2,192 records, which included 17 publications with at least 10 infected cancer patients. Also, 5 articles were added from the additional search of the references cited by those 17 publications. Ten publications were from Chinese authors. Data analysis showed that COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients, and frequent therapeutic visits to the healthcare facility may be the cause. The presence of neoplasia predisposed patients to develop severe disease. Advanced age, associated comorbidities, advanced malignancy, and the presence of serum inflammatory markers increased the risk of developing severe disease. Initial studies indicate that the use of systemic treatment may also be a predisposing factor. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of becoming infected by COVID-19 and developing severe disease is higher in the oncological population.","Castañeda, Carlos A; Castillo, Miluska; Rojas-Vilca, José Luis; Fuentes, Hugo; Gómez, Henry L",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,,569

We also explore the role of digital technology in tackling lockdown loneliness amid the pandemic. In this regard, we highlight and discuss a number of the key relevant issues: a description of lockdown loneliness, the burden of lockdown loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, characteristics of people who are more likely to be affected by lockdown loneliness, factors that could increase the risk of loneliness, lockdown loneliness as an important public health issue, tackling loneliness during the pandemic, digital technology tools for social connection and networking during the pandemic, assessment of digital technology tools from the end users' perspectives, and access to and use of digital technology for tackling lockdown loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We suggest that the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people who are more prone to lockdown loneliness are provided with access to digital technology so that they can connect socially with their loved ones and others; this could reduce loneliness resulting from social distancing and lockdowns during the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, some key issues such as access to and knowledge of digital technology tools must be considered. In addition, the involvement of all key stakeholders (family and friends, social care providers, and clinicians and health allied professionals) should be ensured.","Shah, Syed Ghulam Sarwar; Nogueras, David; van Woerden, Hugo Cornelis; Kiparoglou, Vasiliki",J Med Internet Res,,569

The current crisis is so severe that we should not take the answer for granted. It requires serious thought and we start by reviewing some arguments for and against a green approach. A crucial element is of course to see how different industries fare in the current crisis. Our empirical contribution is to examine daily stock returns for firms from the STOXX Europe 600 index. We find that firms with higher carbon intensities experienced significantly large decreases in stock values particularly those within the crude petroleum extraction, air transport and coke and refined petroleum industries. Our tentative conclusion is that efforts to revitalize the economy should avoid subsidizing stranded assets and instead target the industries of the future. However, identifying these will not necessarily be easy. We find, for example, that having an official ESG ""climate change policy"" has no effect on firm performance during the pandemic.

The timely diagnosis of infected patients is a critical step to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The chest radiography imaging has shown to be an effective screening technique in diagnosing the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the pressure on radiologists and control of the epidemic, fast and accurate a hybrid deep learning framework for diagnosing COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray images is developed and termed as the COVID-CheXNet system. First, the contrast of the X-ray image was enhanced and the noise level was reduced using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Butterworth bandpass filter, respectively. This was followed by fusing the results obtained from two different pre-trained deep learning models based on the incorporation of a ResNet34 and high-resolution network model trained using a large-scale dataset. Herein, the parallel architecture was considered, which provides radiologists with a high degree of confidence to discriminate between the healthy and COVID-19 infected people. The proposed COVID-CheXNet system has managed to correctly and accurately diagnose the COVID-19 patients with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99%, sensitivity of 99.98%, specificity of 100%, precision of 100%, F1-score of 99.99%, MSE of 0.011%, and RMSE of 0.012% using the weighted sum rule at the score-level.

To date, there is no specific drug registered to combat the disease it causes, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current study, we used an in silico approach to screen natural compounds to find potent inhibitors of the host enzyme transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). This enzyme facilitates viral particle entry into host cells, and its inhibition blocks virus fusion with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This, in turn, restricts SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. A three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was built using SWISS-MODEL and validated by RAMPAGE. The natural compounds library Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS), containing 30,927 compounds, was screened against the target protein. Two techniques were used in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) for this purpose, i.e., a ligand-based pharmacophore approach and a molecular docking-based screening. In total, 2140 compounds with pharmacophoric features were retained using the first approach. Using the second approach, 85 compounds with molecular docking comparable to or greater than that of the standard inhibitor (camostat mesylate) were identified. The top 12 compounds with the most favorable structural features were studied for physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties. The low-molecular-weight compound NPC306344 showed significant interaction with the active site residues of TMPRSS2, with a binding energy score of -14.69. Further in vitro and in vivo validation is needed to study and develop an anti-COVID-19 drug based on the structures of the most promising compounds identified in this study.","Rahman, Noor; Basharat, Zarrin; Yousuf, Muhammad; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Rastrelli, Luca; Khan, Haroon",Molecules (Basel),,569

Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1-19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY¥200/US$28 (IQR CNY¥100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine.

In order to determine the effect of processing parameters on the DDS, the processing parameters were varied following manners: (a) the value of P1 was varied in the range of 1-50 atm at DES/PO = 5, T = 298 K and n = 10, (b) the value of DES/PO was varied in the range of 1-10 at P1 = 30 atm, T = 298 K and n = 10, (c) the value of temperatures was varied within the range 298-338 K at P1 = 30 atm, DES/PO = 5, and n = 10, and (d) the value of (n) was varied within the range 1-20 at P1 = 30 atm, DES/PO = 5, and T = 298 K. Based on the obtained results, it was found that the increase in the values of P1, DES/PO, T, and n leads to the increase in the value of DDS of pyrolytic oil. The optimal processing parameters EXDS of pyrolytic oil are determined. The model mechanism of the extractive desulfurization of pyrolytic oil with deep eutectic solvent and the influence of cavitation effects on the degree of pyrolytic oil desulfurization are discussed.","Jovanovic, Jelena D; Petkovic, Sandra D; Gigov, Mihajlo N; Adnadjevic, Borivoj K",,,569

315028,Does facing the challenges of a global pandemic require more than evidence?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to have a worse clinical course among infected men compared with women, thus highlighting concerns about gender predisposition to serious prognosis. Therefore, androgens, particularly testosterone (T), could be suspected as playing a critical role in driving this excess of risk. However, gonadal function in critically ill men is actually unknown, mainly because serum T concentration is not routinely measured in clinical practice, even more in this clinical context. OBJECTIVE: To overview on possible mechanisms by which serum T levels could affect the progression of COVID-19 in men. METHODS: Authors searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google, and institutional websites for medical subject headings terms and free text words referred to ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""testosterone,"" ""male hypogonadism,"" ""gender"" ""immune system,"" ""obesity,"" ""thrombosis"" until May 19th 2020. RESULTS: T, co-regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 in host cells, may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Instead, low serum T levels may predispose to endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis and defective immune response, leading to both impaired viral clearance and systemic inflammation. Obesity, one of the leading causes of severe prognosis in infected patients, is strictly associated with functional hypogonadism, and may consistently strengthen the aforementioned alterations, ultimately predisposing to serious respiratory and systemic consequences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: T in comparison to estrogen may predispose men to a widespread COVID-19 infection. Low serum levels of T, which should be supposed to characterize the hormonal milieu in seriously ill individuals, may predispose men, especially elderly men, to poor prognosis or death. Further studies are needed to confirm these pathophysiological assumptions and to promptly identify adequate therapeutic strategies.","Giagulli, Vito A; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Magrone, Thea; Jirillo, Emilio; Lisco, Giuseppe; De Pergola, Giovanni; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Androl.

315049,Profiling tourists' use of public transport through smart travel card data,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for over 380,000 COVID-19 related deaths, has caused significant strain on healthcare infrastructure and clinical laboratories globally. The pandemic's initial challenges include broad diagnostic testing, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment. In early 2020, primer/probe sets distributed by the CDC utilized the same fluorophore for molecular detection - requiring multiple assays to be run in parallel - consuming valuable and limited resources. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to UW Virology for SARS-CoV-2 clinical testing were extracted, amplified by our laboratory developed test (LDT) - a CDC-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR reaction - and analyzed for agreement between the multiplexed assay. Laboratory- confirmed respiratory infection samples were included to evaluate assay cross-reaction specificity. RESULTS: Triplexing correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 98.4% of confirmed positive or inconclusive patient samples by single-plex LDT (n = 183/186). All 170 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples tested by single-plex LDT were negative by triplexing. Other laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections did not amplify for SARS-CoV-2 in the triplex reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplexing two virus-specific gene targets and an extraction control was found to be comparable to running parallel assays independently, while significantly improving assay throughput.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Nalla, Arun K; Huang, Meei-Li; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J Clin Virol,,569

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AR navigation system for TIPS was designed. Three-dimensional (3D) liver models including portal and hepatic vein anatomy were extracted from preoperative CT images. The 3D models, intraoperative subjects, and electromagnetic tracking information of the puncture needles were integrated through the system calibration. In the AR head-mounted display, the 3D models were overlaid on the subjects, which was a liver phantom in the first phase and live beagle dogs in the second phase. One life-size liver phantom and 9 beagle dogs were used in the experiments. Imaging after puncture was performed to validate whether the needle tip accessed the target hepatic vein successfully. RESULTS: Endovascular punctures of the portal vein of the liver phantom were repeated 30 times under the guidance of the AR system, and the puncture needle successfully accessed the target vein during each attempt. In the experiments of live canine subjects, the punctures were successful in 2 attempts in 7 beagle dogs and in 1 attempt in the remaining 2 dogs. The puncture time of needle from hepatic vein to portal vein was 5-10 s in the phantom experiments and 10-30 s in the canine experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of AR-based navigation facilitating accurate and successful portal vein access in preclinical models of TIPS was validated.","Yang, Jian; Zhu, Jianjun; Sze, Daniel Y; Cui, Li; Li, Xiaohui; Bai, Yanhua; Ai, Danni; Fan, Jingfan; Song, Hong; Duan, Feng",J Vasc Interv Radiol,,569

The ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a universal framework for addressing the issues identified in previous development agendas and achieving policy goals in social, economic and environmental spheres. However, the governments and decision-makers across the world have been facing challenges related to monitoring and assessing the progress of SDGs. The use of geospatial science and spatial data architectures can address these challenges and support holistic monitoring and evaluation of SDGs. This editorial paper discusses the role of geospatial science in implementation of SDGs by drawing on the scholarly works published in the special issue titled ‘Geospatiality and Sustainable Development Goals’. The issue provided a platform for research publications by young and early career geographers from across the world. Several papers in the issue were drawn from different IGU conference sessions organised by the IGU-Task Force for Young and Early Career Geographers (IGU-YECG) since from its establishment (Beijing, 2016) to the upcoming 34th IGC at Istanbul (2021).

Microcracks at the surface of the fatigued NiTi wires were characterized by SEM and TEM. It was found that the carefully engineered 70 nm thick TiO2 oxide provides the NiTi wire with similar level of protection against the static corrosion as the less than 10 nm thin natural oxide on the electropolished wire and that it does not have any positive effect on its performance in environmental fatigue tests, whatsoever.

It is characterized by 'hotspots' of high infections interspersed within regions where infections are sporadic to absent. In this work, the sparseness of COVID-19 infections and their time variations were analyzed across the US at scales ranging from 10 km (county scale) to 2600 km (continental scale). It was found that COVID-19 cases are multi-scaling with a multifractality kernel that monotonically approached that of the underlying population. The spatial correlation of infections between counties increased rapidly in March 2020; that rise continued but at a slower pace subsequently, trending towards the spatial correlation of the population agglomeration. This shows that the disease had already spread across the USA in early March such that travel restriction thereafter (starting on March 15th 2020) had minor impact on the subsequent spatial propagation of COVID-19. The ramifications of targeted interventions on spatial patterns of new infections were explored using the epidemiological susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model mapped onto the population agglomeration template. These revealed that re-opening rural areas would have a smaller impact on the spread and evolution of the disease than re-opening urban (dense) centers which would disturb the system for months. This study provided a novel way for interpreting the spatial spread of COVID-19, along with a practical approach (multifractals/SIR/spectral slope) that could be employed to capture the variability and intermittency at all scales while maintaining the spatial structure.","Geng, Xiaolong; Gerges, Firas; Katul, Gabriel G; Bou-Zeid, Elie; Nassif, Hani; Boufadel, Michel C",Chem Eng J,,569

In this consensus statement, an international group of experts present mitigation strategies and treatment guidance for patients suffering from high grade gliomas (HGG) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHOD / RESULTS: 16 international experts in the treatment of HGG contributed to this consensus-based practice recommendation including neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation -oncologists and a medical physicist. Generally, treatment of neuro-oncological patients cannot be significantly delayed and initiating therapy should not be outweighed by COVID-19. We present detailed interdisciplinary treatment strategies for molecular subgroups in two pandemic scenarios, a scale-up phase and a crisis phase. CONCLUSION: This practice recommendation presents a pragmatic framework and consensus-based mitigation strategies for the treatment of HGG patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Bernhardt, Denise; Wick, Wolfgang; Weiss, Stephanie E; Sahgal, Arjun; Lo, Simon S; Suh, John H; Chang, Eric L; Foote, Matthew; Perry, James; Meyer, Bernhard; Vajkoczy, Peter; Wen, Patrick Y; Straube, Christoph; Pigorsch, Steffi; Wilkens, Jan J; Combs, Stephanie E",Neuro oncol,,569

We found out that, with the optimal tour path, it took roughly 78 minutes for driving a car, 115 minutes on foot, while 117 minutes for taking a bus. On the other hand, the optimal total distance for driving a car would be 13.918 km while for pedestrians to walk, 7.844 km. These results probably mean that there is large space for the improvement on public transportation in this city. Comparison of computation time demanded between the brute-force enumeration of all possible paths and SAMA was also presented, together with animation of the processes for the algorithm to find out the optimal route. It is expected that computation time is astronomically increasing for the brute-force enumeration with more number of sites, while it only takes SAMA much less order of magnitude in time to calculate the optimal solution for larger number of sites. Several optimal options of routes were also provided in each transportation method. However, it is possible that in some types of transportation there could be only one optimal route having no circular or mirrored duplicates.","Tong, Kin Neng; Fong, Iat In; Li, In Iat; Cheng, Chi Him Anthony; Choi, Soi Chak; Ye, Hau Xiang; Lee, Wei Shan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04216v1.pdf,569

Information on COVID-19 in nondialysis CKD patients is not available yet. CASE REPORTS: Here we present 7 patients with grade 4-5 CKD who developed symptomatic COVID-19; they comprise 2.6% of our 267 advanced CKD patients. The estimated GFR was between 12 and 20 mL/min during the month prior to COVID-19. The 3 major symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, and 5 patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and steroids were the most frequently prescribed drugs. Two patients needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. All patients showed minimal to moderate kidney function deterioration during admission, with an eGFR decline below 5 mL/min in 6 cases. No patient required acute dialysis. Six patients were discharged alive and remained dialysis free athe t the time of reporting, and one 76-year-old patient died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affects grade 4-5 CKD patients, but prognosis may be acceptable if prompt supportive measures are applied. These findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts, and further observations will be needed to understand the full spectrum of clinical features and the optimal approach to COVID-19 in patients with advanced CKD.","Collado, Silvia; Arenas, María Dolores; Barbosa, Francesc; Cao, Higini; Montero, María Milagro; Villar-García, Judit; Barrios, Clara; Rodríguez, Eva; Sans, Laia; Sierra, Adriana; Pérez-Sáez, María José; Redondo-Pachón, Dolores; Coca, Armando; Maiques, José María; Güerri-Fernández, Roberto; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio",Kidney Blood Press Res,,569

Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed. We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages, prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease. We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the nervous system, especially in the olfactory pathway.","Butowt, Rafal; Bilinska, Katarzyna",ACS Chem Neurosci,,569

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the 'corrected covered area' method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions-theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

322514,Exploring the Financial Planning Decisions Related to Greater Access to Retirement Funds Via the CARES Act,2020,"Philosophical view of embodiment, one of the most influential hypotheses in cognitive science, postulates that sensorimotor experiences and bodily states influence people’s behavior, cognition, and emotion. Despite embodiment theory addressing the basic experiences of cognitive life, there is a paucity of information available regarding the health consequences of holding such a philosophic belief. In the current investigation, we examined a new idea that embodiment theory leads people to believe in the central role of physical body in shaping cognitive processes and mental activities, which can in turn alter individuals’ motivation to comply with preventive measures to the COVID-19. In Study 1, participants who were primed with theories of embodied cognition (vs. Cartesian dualism) self-reported more compliance with safety-promoting measures surrounding the new coronavirus disease. Extending beyond self-report measures, Study 2 focused on an actual virus-mitigation behavior. The results showed that participants primed with philosophic conceptions of embodiment (vs. dualism) were more likely to choose face masks (vs. pencils) as a gift. These findings suggest that the philosophical view of embodiment not only offers scientifically valuable insight into the mechanics of cognitive processing, but increases people’s willingness to follow non-pharmaceutical containment measures in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Heng",Personality and Individual Differences,,569

We report how a decision might be reached and reported on, to include or exclude these participants. We illustrate using a motivating scenario from the BREATHE trial (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02426112) evaluating azithromycin for the treatment of chronic lung disease in people aged 6-19 years with HIV in Zimbabwe and Malawi. KEY POINTS: Including all enrolled and randomised participants in the primary analysis of a trial ensures an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect using intention-to-treat principles, and minimises the effects of confounding through balanced allocation to trial arm. Ineligible participants are sometimes enrolled, due to measurement or human error. Of 347 participants enrolled into the BREATHE trial, 11 (3.2%) were subsequently found to be ineligible based on lung function criteria. We assumed no safety risk of azithromycin treatment; their inclusion in the trial and subsequent analysis of the intervention effect therefore mirrors clinical practice. Senior trial investigators considered diurnal variations in the measurement of lung function, advantages of retaining a higher sample size and advice from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Trial Steering Committee, and decided to include these participants in primary analysis. We planned and reported analyses including and excluding these participants, and in our case the interpretation of treatment effect was consistent. CONCLUSION: The decision, by senior investigators, on whether to exclude enrolled participants, should reflect issues of safety, treatment efficacy, statistical power and measurement error. As long as decisions are made prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan for the trial, the risk of exclusions creating bias should be minimal. The decision taken should be transparently reported and a sensitivity analysis can present the opposite decision.","Rehman, Andrea M; Ferrand, Rashida; Allen, Elizabeth; Simms, Victoria; McHugh, Grace; Weiss, Helen Anne",BMJ Open,,569

Colloidal silver has particularly benefited from this rush given its empirically and scientifically documented anti-bacterial and anti-viral actions. The lack of standards in the unregulated supplements industry remains a major roadblock in evaluating the quality and consistency of marketed products or assessing the accuracy of the information provided by manufacturers. This study is the first scientifically rigorous attempt to evaluate commercial silver colloidal products offered for sale on the internet. Methods: Fourteen of the most popular colloidal silver products purchased from Amazon (www.amazon.com) were evaluated using state-of-the-art analytical techniques widely accepted as gold standards for investigating the properties (size, shape) and the dispersion of silver nanoparticles. Results: Commercial samples were analysed using UV-Vis, FE-SEM and AAS techniques. In general, the Ag concentration was very close to those claimed by the manufacturer. The colorless product shows no absorbance in the UV-Vis analysis. The FESEM and STEM images confirmed the conclusions of the UV-Vis analysis. Conclusion: The results of this evaluation show clearly that 70% of the commercial products evaluated contain only ionic silver. Despite the evidence showing that silver nanoparticles are not present, eight of these products are promoted by the manufacturers as 'colloidal silver'. Considering the extensive scientific research showing major differences between silver ionic and silver nanoparticles in terms of mechanisms of action, efficacy and safety, it is clear that this misrepresentation impacts the consumers and must be addressed. This study serves as blueprint for a scientific protocol to be followed by manufacturers for characterizing their silver supplements.","Kumar, Ajeet; Goia, Dan V",Int J Nanomedicine,,569

Most current investigations focused on SARS-COV-2-related effects on the renin-angiotensin system and especially the resultant increase in angiotensin II, neglecting its effects on the kinin-kallikrein system. SARS-COV-2-induced ACE2 inhibition leads to the augmentation of bradykinin 1-receptor effects, as ACE2 inactivates des-Arg9-bradykinin, a bradykinin metabolite. SARS-COV-2 also decreases bradykinin 2-receptor effects as it affects bradykinin synthesis by inhibiting cathepsin L, a kininogenase present at the site of infection and involved in bradykinin production. The physiologies of both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein system are functionally related suggesting that any intervention aiming to treat SARS-COV-2-infected patients by triggering one system but ignoring the other may not be adequately effective. Interestingly, the snake-derived bradykinin-potentiating peptide (BPP-10c) acts on both systems. BPP-10c strongly decreases angiotensin II by inhibiting ACE, increasing bradykinin-related effects on the bradykinin 2-receptor and increasing nitric oxide-mediated effects. Based on a narrative review of the literature, we suggest that BPP-10c could be an optimally effective option to consider when aiming at developing an anti-SARS-COV-2 drug.","Gouda, Ahmed S; Mégarbane, Bruno",Drug dev. res,,569

Patient demographics, ECG variables, peak troponins, use of standard medications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and a predictive model of survival was developed using classification tree analysis. Of the 145 admitted patients, 38 (26%) died. Deceased patients were more likely to have a significantly higher incidence of poor R-Wave progression [6 of 37 (16.2%) Vs. 0 of 104 (0%), p < 0.001] as well as prolonged QTc values [24 of 37 (64.9%) Vs. 38 of 99 (38.4%), p 0.006]. Significant ST segment depressions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%) of the deceased category compared to 0% in the non-deceased (p < 0.01). Right and/or left atrial enlargement was more prevalent in the deceased cohort [7 of 37 (18.9%) Vs. 4 of 104 (3.8%), p = 0.03]. Bundle branch blocks were more prevalent in the deceased group [9 of 35 (25.8%) Vs. 7 of 104 (6.7%), p 0.002]. Peak troponins were significantly higher in the deceased group (1.0 Vs 0.07 ng/ml, p < 0.001) A prediction tree built utilizing age, PACs, troponins and QTc had an accuracy of 85.5%. 65 of 74 patients (87.8%) were correctly predicted to survive, while 23 of 29 (79.3%) were correctly predicted to become deceased. Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the parameters of age, QT interval, troponin and PACs are useful for prognostication and help predict survival with reasonable accuracy.","Singh, Aniruddha; Akbar, Muhammad S; McElroy, Doug; McCurdy, Matthew; Young, Fletcher; Thomas, Jayshree; Nguyen, Chrystie; Pfirman, Kristopher S",Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal,,569

327819,Too big to fail? Accounting for predictions of financial distress in English professional football clubs,2020,"Machine learning requires a large volume of sample data, especially when it is used in high-accuracy medical applications. However, patient records are one of the most sensitive private information that is not usually shared among institutes. This paper presents spatio-temporal split learning, a distributed deep neural network framework, which is a turning point in allowing collaboration among privacy-sensitive organizations. Our spatio-temporal split learning presents how distributed machine learning can be efficiently conducted with minimal privacy concerns. The proposed split learning consists of a number of clients and a centralized server. Each client has only has one hidden layer, which acts as the privacy-preserving layer, and the centralized server comprises the other hidden layers and the output layer. Since the centralized server does not need to access the training data and trains the deep neural network with parameters received from the privacy-preserving layer, privacy of original data is guaranteed. We have coined the term, spatio-temporal split learning, as multiple clients are spatially distributed to cover diverse datasets from different participants, and we can temporally split the learning process, detaching the privacy preserving layer from the rest of the learning process to minimize privacy breaches. This paper shows how we can analyze the medical data whilst ensuring privacy using our proposed multi-site spatio-temporal split learning algorithm on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans, MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs (MURA) X-ray images, and cholesterol levels.","Ha, Yoo Jeong; Yoo, Minjae; Lee, Gusang; Jung, Soyi; Choi, Sae Won; Kim, Joongheon; Yoo, Seehwan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10147v1.pdf,569
327958,"We should not vaccinate the young to protect the old: a response to Giubilini, Savulescu, and Wilkinson",2021,"An important parameter for COVID-19 is the case fatality rate (CFR). It has been applied to wide applications, including the measure of the severity of the infection, the estimation of the number of infected cases, risk assessment etc. However, there remains a lack of understanding on several aspects of CFR, including population factors that are important to CFR, the apparent discrepancy of CFRs in different countries, and how the age effect comes into play. We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28, 2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly, the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising: during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of public health and medical research to factor in.","Yan, Donghui; Chen, Aiyou; Yang, Buqing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01313v1.pdf,569

329168,Harboring hope: sustaining resilience in a post-COVID world,2021,"On 10 March 2020, in Italy, a total lockdown was put in place to limit viral transmission of COVID-19 infection as much as possible. Research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted detrimental effects in children and their parents. However, little is known about such effects in children with neurodevelopment disorders and their caregivers. The present study investigated how the lockdown has impacted the physiological and psychological well-being of children with Fragile X-Syndrome (FXS), aged from 2 to 16 years, and their mothers. In an online survey, 48 mothers of FXS children reported their perception of self-efficacy as caregivers and, at the same time, their children's sleep habits, behavioral and emotional difficulties during, and retrospectively, before the lockdown. Results showed a general worsening of sleep quality, and increasing behavioral problems. Although mothers reported a reduction in external support, their perception of self-efficacy as caregivers did not change during the home confinement compared to the period before. Overall, the present study suggested that specific interventions to manage sleep problems, as well as specific therapeutic and social support for increasing children and mother psychological well-being, need to be in place to mitigate the long-term effects of a lockdown.","Di Giorgio, Elisa; Polli, Roberta; Lunghi, Marco; Murgia, Alessandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569

The study aims to determine the mortality in our center due to covid-19 in cancer patients during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. RESULTS: Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40% (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.","Lara Álvarez, Miguel Ángel; Rogado Revuelta, Jacobo; Obispo Portero, Berta; Pangua Méndez, Cristina; Serrano Montero, Gloria; López Alfonso, Ana",Med Clin (Barc),,569

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population includes 99 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 4 March and 25 March 2020. Fifty-three patients with a history of cardiac disease were compared with 46 without cardiac disease. Among cardiac patients, 40% had a history of heart failure, 36% had atrial fibrillation, and 30% had coronary artery disease. Mean age was 67 ± 12 years, and 80 (81%) patients were males. No differences were found between cardiac and non-cardiac patients except for higher values of serum creatinine, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity troponin T in cardiac patients. During hospitalization, 26% patients died, 15% developed thrombo-embolic events, 19% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6% had septic shock. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09). The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.","Inciardi, Riccardo M; Adamo, Marianna; Lupi, Laura; Cani, Dario S; Di Pasquale, Mattia; Tomasoni, Daniela; Italia, Leonardo; Zaccone, Gregorio; Tedino, Chiara; Fabbricatore, Davide; Curnis, Antonio; Faggiano, Pompilio; Gorga, Elio; Lombardi, Carlo M; Milesi, Giuseppe; Vizzardi, Enrico; Volpini, Marco; Nodari, Savina; Specchia, Claudia; Maroldi, Roberto; Bezzi, Michela; Metra, Marco",Eur Heart J,,569

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) contribute to coagulopathy, though their role in COVID-19 remains unclear. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and characteristics of aPLs in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sera collected from 66 COVID-19 patients who were critically ill and 13 COVID-19 patients who were not critically ill were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs), anti-ß2 -glycoprotein I (anti-ß2 GPI) (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and IgG anti-ß2 GPI-domain 1 (anti-ß2 GPI-D1) and IgM and IgG anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) antibodies were detected in the serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Of the 66 COVID-19 patients in critical condition, aPLs were detected in 31 (47% ). Antiphospholipid antibodies were not present among COVID-19 patients who were not in critical condition. The IgA anti-ß2 GPI antibody was the most commonly observed aPL in patients with COVID-19 and was present in 28.8% (19 of 66) of the critically ill patients, followed by IgA aCLs (17 of 66, or 25.8%) and IgG anti-ß2 GPI (12 of 66, or 18.2%). For multiple aPLs, IgA anti-ß2 GPI + IgA aCLs was the most common antibody profile observed (15 of 66, or 22.7%), followed by IgA anti-ß2 GPI + IgA aCL + IgG anti-ß2 GPI (10 of 66, or 15.2%). Antiphospholipid antibodies emerge ~35-39 days after disease onset. A dynamic analysis of aPLs revealed 4 patterns based on the persistence or transient appearance of the aPLs. Patients with multiple aPLs had a significantly higher incidence of cerebral infarction compared to patients who were negative for aPLs (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Antiphospholipid antibodies were common in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Repeated testing demonstrating medium to high titers of aPLs and the number of aPL types a patient is positive for may help in identifying patients who are at risk of developing cerebral infarction. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be transient and disappear within a few weeks, but in genetically predisposed patients, COVID-19 may trigger the development of an autoimmune condition similar to the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), referred to as ""COVID-19-induced APS-like syndrome."" Long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients who are positive for aPLs would be of great importance in understanding the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus.","Xiao, Meng; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Shulan; Qin, Xuzhen; Xia, Peng; Cao, Wei; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Huan; Ding, Xin; Zhao, Hua; Zhang, Hongmin; Wang, Chunyao; Zhao, Jing; Sun, Xuefeng; Tian, Ran; Wu, Wei; Wu, Dong; Ma, Jie; Chen, Yu; Zhang, Dong; Xie, Jing; Yan, Xiaowei; Zhou, Xiang; Liu, Zhengyin; Wang, Jinglan; Du, Bin; Qin, Yan; Gao, Peng; Lu, Minya; Hou, Xin; Wu, Xian; Zhu, Huadong; Xu, Yingchun; Zhang, Wen; Li, Taisheng; Zhang, Fengchun; Zhao, Yongqiang; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Arthritis Rheumatol,,569

However, the association between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and COVID-19 is still unknown. We review the epidemiology, causes, clinical features, and current treatment protocols for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. We also discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for COVID-19-induced inflammatory processes, which can lead to organ damage in paediatric patients who are severely ill. These insights provide evidence for the need to develop a clear case definition and treatment protocol for this new condition and also shed light on future therapeutic interventions and the potential for vaccine development.

332820,Smartphone-based electrochemical sensor for assessing COVID-19 infected patients,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching and unprecedented influence on economies worldwide. It has also impacted on the global population's mental health and caused negative psychosocial effects, which may lead to psychological crises. During the pandemic, the challenges for quarantine hotel employees are not only the increased workloads created by operating a quarantine hotel but also high psychological stress associated with job insecurity, risk of exposure and contagion for themselves, their friends and families. This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. Discussion: In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model.","Teng, Yi-Man; Wu, Kun-Shan; Lin, Kuan-Ling; Xu, Dan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,569
332828,Responding to the COVID-19 emergency: student and academic staff perceptions of academic integrity in the transition to online exams at three Australian universities,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be mitigated by a nationwide approach of individual nations alone. Given its scale and accelerating expansion, COVID-19 requires a coordinated and simultaneous Whole- of-World approach that galvanizes clear global leadership and solidarity from all governments of the world. Considering an 'all hands-on deck' concept, we present a comprehensive list of tools and entities responsible for enabling them, as well a conceptual framework to achieve the maximum impact. The list is drawn from pandemic mitigation tools developed in response to past outbreaks including influenza, coronaviruses, and Ebola, and includes tools to minimize transmission in various settings including person-to-person, crowd, funerals, travel, workplace, and events and gatherings including business, social and religious venues. Included are the roles of individuals, communities, government and other sectors such as school systems, health, institutions, and business. While individuals and communities have significant responsibilities to prevent person-to-person transmission, other entities can play a significant role to enable individuals and communities to make use of the tools. Historic and current data indicate the role of political will, whole-of-government approach, and the role of early introduction of mitigation measures. There is also an urgent need to further elucidate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the epidemiological characteristics such as the low disease burden among women, and the role of COVID-19 in inducing Kawasaki-like syndromes in children. Understanding the role of and development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on our understanding of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL-6) is also critical. Similarly, the role of oxygen therapy as an anti-inflammatory strategy is evident and access to oxygen therapy should be prioritized to avoid the aggravation of COVID-19 infection. We highlight the need for global solidarity to share both mitigation commodities and infrastructure between countries. Given the global reach of COVID-19 and potential for repeat waves of outbreaks, we call on all countries and communities to act synergistically and emphasize the need for synchronized pan-global mitigation efforts to minimize everyone's risk, to maximize collaboration, and to commit to shared progress.","Ebrahim, Shahul H; Zhuo, Jiatong; Gozzer, Ernesto; Ahmed, Qanta A; Imtiaz, Rubina; Ahmed, Yusuf; Doumbia, Seydou; Mujeeb Rahman, N M; Elachola, Habida; Wilder-Smith, A; Memish, Ziad A",Int J Infect Dis,,569

333183,Conclusions: pilgrimage during and after the pandemic crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Lately, one of the major clinical and public health issues has been represented by Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and the risk of transmission of the infection from mother to child. Debate on perinatal management and postnatal care is still ongoing, principally questioning the option of the joint management of mother and child after birth and the safety of breastfeeding. According to the available reports, neonatal COVID-19 appears to have a horizontal transmission and seems to be paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic, compared to older age groups. The aim of this work is to describe a cluster of neonatal COVID-19 and discuss our experience, with reference to current evidence on postnatal care and perinatal management. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational case series of five mother-child dyads, who attended the Labor and Delivery Unit of a first-level hospital in Italy, in March 2020. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables consisted of number of observations, mean and the range of the minimum and maximum values. RESULTS: Five women and four neonates tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In one case, the mother-child dyad was separated and the neonate remained negative on two consecutive tests. Two positive neonates developed symptoms, with a predominant involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Blood tests were unremarkable, except for a single patient who developed mild neutropenia. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We agree that the decision on whether or not to separate a positive/suspected mother from her child should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the parent's will, clinical condition, hospital logistics and the local epidemiological situation. In conformity with literature, in our study, affected neonates were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Despite these reassuring findings, a few cases of severe presentation in the neonatal population have been reported. Therefore, we agree on encouraging clinicians to monitor the neonates with a suspected or confirmed infection.","Olivini, Nicole; Calò Carducci, Francesca Ippolita; Santilli, Veronica; De Ioris, Maria Antonietta; Scarselli, Alessia; Alario, Dario; Geremia, Caterina; Lombardi, Mary Haywood; Marabotto, Caterina; Mariani, Rosanna; Papa, Raffaele Edo; Peschiaroli, Emanuela; Scrocca, Raffaella; Sinibaldi, Serena; Smarrazzo, Andrea; Stella, Pietro; Bernardi, Stefania; Chiurchiù, Sara; Pansa, Paola; Romani, Lorenza; Michaela, Carletti; Concato, Carlo; De Rose, Domenico Umberto; Salvatori, Gugliemo; Rossi, Paolo; Villani, Alberto; Dotta, Andrea; D039,; Argenio, Patrizia; Campana, Andrea",Ital J Pediatr,,569
333432,Mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and misinformation,2021-02-04,"Objective: We report our experience of incorporating chest CT scan in the initial neuroimaging protocol for evaluation of acute stroke patients. Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with an increased risk for acute ischemic stroke but screening for COVID-19 based on clinical criteria or laboratory testing may be difficult in acute stroke evaluation. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan may be another time-sensitive option for identification. of COVID-19 in such patients. Design/Methods: All acute stroke patients underwent chest CT scan concurrent to CT head, CT angiogram of head and neck and CT perfusion for 4 months. We identified patients who had chest CT scan findings that were suggestive of COVID-19 including bilateral, multilobar ground glass opacification with a peripheral or posterior distribution, and/or consolidation (mainly in the lower lobes). All patients subsequently underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swab with contact isolation until COVID-19 could be excluded. Results: A total of 224 consecutive patients (mean age 62.12 years±SD;15.3) underwent acute stroke evaluation with a concurrent chest CT scan. The chest CT identified findings suggestive of COVID-19 in 11 (4.9%) patients. Subsequent PCR testing did not confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 in any of the patient. Another 99 patients (44%) without any findings suggestive of COVID-19 on chest CT scan underwent PCR testing. PCR testing did not confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 in any of the patients. Four patients (4.3%) with chest CT scan findings suggestive of COVID-19 were found to have an ischemic stroke while 7 patients (5.9%) with chest CT scan findings suggestive of COVID-19 did not have any ischemic stroke (stroke mimic). Conclusions: We found a very low yield for identifying COVID-19 in acute stroke patients by performing chest CT scan concurrent to standard acute stroke neuroimaging protocol.","Ishfaq, M.; Bhagavan, S.; Ishfaq, A.; Pulimamidi, S.; Kumar, M.; French, B.; Siddiq, F.; Gomez, C.; Qureshi, A.",Neurology,,569

This study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature regarding visitor effects on zoo-housed primate’s activity budgets, with the purpose of quantifying the behavioral variability under two conditions: guest presence and guest absence. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many zoos were closed to the public for varying lengths of time. The Buffalo Zoo was closed to guests for an 18-week period including the summer of 2020, which allowed us to effectively control for zoo guest presence. This case report compares data on the zoo’s gorilla troop from the same time period in 2019. We found inconsistent results, similar to prior studies conducted with zoo-housed gorilla troops. Most gorillas were observed foraging less and exhibiting more inactivity in 2020, whereas the adult male silverback showed the opposite pattern. Abnormal or undesirable behaviors were performed less frequently when guests were absent however, these differences were not significant. We encourage others to compare behavior patterns during the pandemic shutdown to add to our knowledge base of visitor effects. We suggest that researchers do not try and generalize their individual and troop results to the entire population of gorillas in managed care, as both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to individual differences in behavioral response.","Miller, M.

Peptides are characterized by low toxicity and small interface areas; therefore, they are good targets for therapeutic strategies, rational drug planning and protein inhibition. Approximately 10% of the ethical pharmaceutical market is protein/peptide-based. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40% of protein interactions are mediated by peptides. Despite the fast increase in the volume of biological data, particularly on sequences and structures, there remains a lack of broad and comprehensive protein-peptide databases and tools that allow the retrieval, characterization and understanding of protein-peptide recognition and consequently support peptide design. RESULTS: We introduce Propedia, a comprehensive and up-to-date database with a web interface that permits clustering, searching and visualizing of protein-peptide complexes according to varied criteria. Propedia comprises over 19,000 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank including structural and sequence information from protein-peptide complexes. The main advantage of Propedia over other peptide databases is that it allows a more comprehensive analysis of similarity and redundancy. It was constructed based on a hybrid clustering algorithm that compares and groups peptides by sequences, interface structures and binding sites. Propedia is available through a graphical, user-friendly and functional interface where users can retrieve, and analyze complexes and download each search data set. We performed case studies and verified that the utility of Propedia scores to rank promissing interacting peptides. In a study involving predicting peptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we showed that Propedia scores related to similarity between different peptide complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease are in agreement with molecular dynamics free energy calculation. CONCLUSIONS: Propedia is a database and tool to support structure-based rational design of peptides for special purposes. Protein-peptide interactions can be useful to predict, classifying and scoring complexes or for designing new molecules as well.

338294,Game of Sabotage: The culture war for the ABC,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Given the uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing telerehabilitation that enables the remote delivery of rehabilitation services is needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We studied the implementation and the effectiveness of the virtual Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary (GRASP) Program delivered and evaluated via videoconferencing in individuals with stroke. METHODS: The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework with mixed methods was used to evaluate the implementation of the two iterations of the program delivered by a nonprofit organization during the pandemic. RESULTS: REACH: Seventeen people were screened, 13 people were eligible, and 11 consented to participate in the study. EFFECTIVENESS: Between baseline and post-test, participants with stroke demonstrated significant improvement in upper extremity function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-perceived UE function (Stroke Impact Scale). ADOPTION: Factors that facilitate program uptake by the staff were well-planned implementation, appropriate screening procedure, and helpful feedback from the audits. All staff felt comfortable using videoconferencing technology to deliver the program despite some technical difficulties. Factors contributing to ongoing participation included that the participants liked the group, they perceived improvements, and the instructor was encouraging. Only one participant with stroke was not comfortable using videoconferencing technology. IMPLEMENTAION: The program was implemented as intended as evaluated by a fidelity checklist. Participants' adherence was high, as verified by the average attendance and practice time. MAINTENANCE: The organization continued to offer the program. CONCLUSION: The virtual GRASP program was successfully implemented. Although the program was effective in improving both measured and perceived UE function in a small sample of individuals with stroke, caution should be taken in generalizing the results. IMPACT: Implementing telerehabilitation is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our findings provide guidance on the process of delivering a UE rehabilitation program remotely via videoconferencing for stroke. Moreover, insights that arise from this study also inform the implementation of other telerehabilitation services.","Yang, Chieh-Ling; Waterson, Seonaid; Eng, Janice J",Phys. ther,,569

339348,Cities in crisis: examining the pandemic through urban planning and state capacity,2021,"Reducing maternal mortality is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Although there is no vigorous evidence that pregnant women are in the high-risk groups in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is crucial to respond to the pandemic through providing required action plans for confirmed or suspected pregnant women cases while maintaining routine functions. Iran's response and preparedness measures to COVID-19 aimed to meet the essential needs required to protect pregnant women and their families. Establishing a national maternal health network, relying on mechanisms for timely reporting, monitoring, and following-up, preparing guidelines and protocols required for COVID-19 management in pregnant women though a multidisciplinary team working approach, and embedding the precautions of reducing transmission in maternity care were the main measures taken to cope with COVID-19 in pregnancy. Iran's experience in providing maternity care during the COVID-19 can guide other countries affected by COVID-19. However, it should be adapted to local health-care facilities, as well as in response to any further updates on COVID-19.","Changizi, Nasrin; Raeisi, Alireza; Barekati, Hamed; Habibolahi, Abbas; Sajadi, Haniye Sadat; Emami-Afshar, Nezhat; Radpooyan, Laleh",Arch Iran Med,,569

339602,Professional tennis's constellational response to COVID-19. (Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),2020,"By integrating mesoscale models for hydrodynamics and micromechanics, we examine the fluid-driven motion of pairs of capsules on a compliant, adhesive substrate. The capsules, modeled as fluid filled elastic shells, represent cells or polymeric microcapsules. We show that both the relative and the average velocities of two closely spaced, rolling capsules depends on the elasticity of the capsules, the adhesive interaction between the capsules and the substrate, and the compliance of the substrate. We first focused on a stiff surface and found that pairs of rigid capsules always separate from each other, while for deformable capsules, the dynamic behavior depends critically on the strength of the adhesive interaction. For strong adhesion to the substrate, the capsules again roll away from each other, while for a relatively weak adhesion, the capsules actually approach each other. In the case of soft substrates, any significant deformations of the surface that are caused by the capsules give rise to a force that propels the particles to move rapidly apart. Thus, in the case of strong adhesion between the capsules and the soft substrates, both rigid and flexible capsules are driven to separate. On the other hand, for weak adhesion, the elastic particles approach each other, similar to the behavior on stiff surfaces. These findings reveal that the interactions between the capsules are mediated by the nature of the underlying layer. We can harness this information to design surfaces that actively control the relative separation between the capsules. This could be utilized to regulate the motion of biological cells, as well as polymeric microcapsules, and thus, could prove to be useful in various biological assays or tissue engineering studies.","Alexeev, Alexander; Verberg, Rolf; Balazs, Anna C",Soft Matter,,569
340235,COVID-19 transmission and dental treatment: A narrative review,2021,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials often fail to reach their anticipated end points, most frequently because of poor accrual. Prior studies have analyzed trial termination, but it has not been easy to assess accrual estimates using international databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov because of limitations in accessing accrual information. Specifically, it is not easy to extract both anticipated and actual accrual of clinical trials. We designed a new algorithmic approach to extracting trial accrual data from ClinicalTrials.gov and used it to estimate the sufficiency of patient accrual onto genitourinary (GU) cancer trials. METHODS: We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for completed/terminated phase II and III clinical trials for prostate, bladder, kidney, testicular, and ureteral cancers registered after 2007. We extracted trial characteristics from available XML files. We then used a Python algorithm to access prior trial registrations on the ClinicalTrials.gov archive site and extract both anticipated and actual accrual numbers. We then compared the actual accrual of each trial to its anticipated accrual and defined sufficient accrual as 85% of anticipated accrual. RESULTS: The algorithm was 100% accurate compared with hand extraction in a small validation subset. A total of 925 trials were included, of which 840 (91%) had both anticipated and actual accrual. Only 418 (50%) trials had sufficient accrual (&#8805; 85% of anticipated). Considering only trials marked as successfully completed, 395/597 (66%) reached sufficient accrual. CONCLUSION: GU cancer trials often do not meet their anticipated accrual goals. New approaches to trial conduct are direly needed. Our reproducible and scalable approach to extracting accrual information can be applied to analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov in future analyses in the hope of improving the efficiency of the clinical trials enterprise.","Stensland, Kristian; Kaffenberger, Samuel; Canes, David; Galsky, Matthew; Skolarus, Ted; Moinzadeh, Alireza",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,569

342197,Modeling the Economic and Societal Impact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Identify clinical and radiographic features of venous infarct as a presenting feature of COVID-19 in the young. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress. CASE DESCRIPTION: Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics. CONCLUSION: Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.","Klein, David E; Libman, Richard; Kirsch, Claudia; Arora, Rohan",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,569

The COVID-19 pandemic, anti-science policies, radicalized white supremacists, police killings of people of color, and the resurgence of the racial justice movement all inflect surveillance practices in the contemporary moment. In particular, todays polarized political landscape makes it difficult to condemn surveillance in the service of the public good, but irrespective of ones goals or intentions, the embrace of transparency carries its own risks. Transparency, and scientific vision more broadly, is an extension of the Enlightenment and subsequent scientific revolution, which from the start sought to advance knowledge and consolidate white power through the violent subjugation of nature, women, and racial minorities. One fundamental risk of valorizing transparency is that doing so occludes the ways that relations of domination are indelibly encoded into surveillance systems and practices. Given this, I argue that the project of decolonizing surveillance inquiry should now be our primary focus as a field.","Monahan, Torin",Surveillance &amp; Society,,569

342707,Investigation into Information Release of Chinese Government and Departments on COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic challenges health system capacities in many countries. National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible. Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Colorectal cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.","Vecchione, Loredana; Stintzing, Sebastian; Pentheroudakis, George; Douillard, Jean-Yves; Lordick, Florian",,,569

343260,Gender and Political Leadership in a Time of COVID,2020,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the effects of COVID-19 antiepidemic measures and subsequent changes in the function of the health care system on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers in the Republic of Croatia. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence interval - 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019. CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.","Vrdoljak, Eduard; Balja, Melita Peric; Marusic, Zlatko; Avirovic, Manuela; Blazicevic, Valerija; Tomasovic, Cedna; Cerina, Dora; Bajic, Zarko; Mise, Branka Petric; Lovasic, Ingrid Belac; Flam, Josipa; Tomic, Snjezana",Oncologist,,569

A broad spectrum of new supply chain strategy solutions was identified and, based on simulations of selected products, conclusions were drawn and the advantages and disadvantages of theoretical solutions were presented for individual cases. A critical analysis of the literature and simulation methods were used to illustrate the problem presented in this paper, to identify the factors causing greenhouse gas emissions and to draw conclusions in the form of proposals to redesign existing strategies, considering the factors determining the increase in pollution caused by the performed logistics processes. The results of the simulations and the literature analysis indicate that solutions related to the redesign of strategies must consider the specificity of the product and the nature of the chain. Not all proposed strategies are applicable to all chains, and each new strategy must be carefully considered and consider many factors. An important element to reduce the negative environmental impact of chains is a well-thought-out relationship with suppliers, a well-chosen and adapted logistics infrastructure, including means of transport. The presented solutions clearly indicate that the environmental aspect plays an increasingly important role in chain management and influences the applied chain strategies. However, reducing the environmental impact of a chain is not a revolutionary approach and an easy-to-implement strategy change, but a well-thought-out, long-term process that considers the specifics of the products, the possibilities of alternative sourcing and distribution modes, and the need to invest in logistics infrastructure to make it as environmentally neutral as possible.","Wiśniewski, Tomasz",Energies,,569

The processing of biodiesel from non-edible Moringa Oleifera was investigated using a single-step transesterification technique. Both fuels had their key physicochemical properties measured and investigated. In a common-rail diesel engine, the effects of MB50 fuel blend on the symmetric characteristics of engine-out responses were evaluated under five load settings and at 1000 rpm. As compared to standard diesel, MB50 increased brake thermal efficiency (BTE), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions while lowering brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and smoke emissions for all engine loads. A further study of injection pressure and start of injection (SOI) timing for MB50 fuel was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The RSM optimization resulted in improved combustion dynamics due to symmetry operating parameters, resulting in a simultaneous decrease in NOx and smoke emissions without sacrificing BTE. RSM is an efficient optimization method for achieving optimal fuel injection parameter settings, as can be deduced. As a result, a clearer understanding of the use of MB50 fuel in diesel engines can be given, allowing for the best possible engine efficiency.","Yew Heng, Teoh Heoy Geok How Sher Farooq Le Thanh Danh Ong Hwai Chyuan Nguyen Huu Tho Haseeb Yaqoob",Symmetry,,569

345289,Embracing socioscientific issues-based teaching and decision-making in teacher professional development,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for many pathological processes, such as altered vascular disease development, dysfunctional thrombosis, and a heightened inflammatory state. Although many clinical reports support these observations, there has been limited experimental work to determine the underlying mechanisms and cellular processes induced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Importantly, these structural proteins are conserved amongst all current known SARS-CoVs. Our objective was to investigate the effects of the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane-Envelope (M) SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins on inflammation, thrombosis, and diabetic disease markers of human aortic adventitial fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We hypothesized that short-term exposure to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins would result in increased expression of inflammatory, thrombotic, and diabetic proteins in both cell types, which would support a mechanism for altered vascular disease progression. To test this, the cells were incubated independently with the three SARS-CoV-2 proteins for one hour, after which we analyzed the expression of gC1qR, ICAM-1, tissue factor, RAGE, GLUT-4, thrombomodulin, PECAM-1, and Connexin-43 (in their respective cell types), using an ELISA approach. All cells were monitored for maintenance of typical culture parameters using a live/dead cell cytotoxicity assay and the MTT assay (for metabolic activity). We observed that each of these markers were significantly up-regulated after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins as compared to fibroblasts or endothelial cells that were not exposed to these proteins. Interestingly, the extent of the expression of these markers was sometimes significantly different for each of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. This suggests that each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins interacts with these cells through different mechanisms, however, more work will need to be undertaken to determine the mechanisms by which these proteins interact with cells. Thus, these results indicate that the cellular response of vascular cells towards SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins promotes inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular dysfunction. However, these interactions are regulated by complex and possibly different cellular receptors/signal transduction pathways that should be explored further.","Freda, Christopher Yin Wei Ghebrehiwet Berhane Rubenstein David",The FASEB Journal,,569

The management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has primarily impacted emergency departments, medical teams, and intensive care units. However, the impact on health systems as a whole, including surgical specialties, has been wide ranging. We aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on the number and characteristics of general surgical patients reviewed and/or admitted by the surgical team within a district general hospital. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted in the 2-week period from start of the lockdown (Monday 23rd March 2020 to 5th April 2020), and the same period 1 year earlier (Monday 25th March 2019 to 7th April 2019). Number of patients reviewed and admitted were compared between the two cohorts. Data including diagnosis, operation/procedural interventions, and length of stay were analysed. The overall number of patients reviewed and admitted by the surgical team was substantially lower during the period of lockdown (61 vs 126). Of the patients seen during lockdown, a smaller proportion were admitted to hospital after initial surgical review (59% vs 77%, p < 0.05). Interventional/operative procedures were performed in a similar proportion of patients in both cohorts (31%). Our data show that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of patients being referred to and admitted by the general surgical team at our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. Explanations for this include reduced attendance due to risk perception of the patients, the impact of lockdown messages and advice regarding self-isolation, as well as an increased threshold for patient admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key learning points include the possible benefits of a reduction in admission to hospital of patients with nonurgent conditions.","Callan, Rory; Assaf, Nazrin; Bevan, Katharine",Surg Res Pract,,569

349481,The Pandemic Holiday Blip in New York City,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure. The role of imaging in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving; however, few algorithms include imaging criteria, and it is unclear what should be done in low-suspicion patients with positive imaging findings. METHODS: From 03/01/2020-03/20/2020, a retrospective review of all patients with suspected COVID-19 on imaging was performed. Imaging was interpreted by a board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologist. Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present. RESULTS: Eight patients with suspected COVID-19 infection on imaging were encountered. Seven patients received testing due to suspicious imaging findings with subsequent lab-confirmed COVID-19. No patients endorsed prior exposure to COVID-19 or recent international travel. COVID-19 was suggested in six patients incidentally on abdominal CT and two on chest radiography. At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms. Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation. Two patients expired during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases. The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.","Xiao, Nicholas; Abboud, Samir; McCarthy, Danielle M; Parekh, Nishant",Emerg Radiol,,569
349966,Growth in Foreign Trade in Liberalized India: The Relevance of FDI,2020,"Although the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, there are currently no virus-specific drugs that are fully effective against SARS-CoV-2. Only a limited number of human-derived cells are capable of supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells remains poor. In contrast, monkey-derived Vero cells are highly susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2, although they are not suitable for the study of antiviral effects by small molecules due to their limited capacity to metabolize drugs compared to human-derived cells. In this study, our goal was to generate a virus-susceptible human cell line that would be useful for the identification and testing of candidate drugs. Towards this end, we stably transfected human lung-derived MRC5 cells with a lentiviral vector encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in MRC5/ACE2 cells. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and progeny virus production were significantly reduced in response to administration of the replication inhibitor, remdesivir, in MRC5/ACE2 cells compared with Vero cells. We conclude that the MRC5/ACE2 cells will be important in developing specific anti-viral therapeutics and will assist in vaccine development to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Uemura, Kentaro; Sasaki, Michihito; Sanaki, Takao; Toba, Shinsuke; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Orba, Yasuko; Hall, William W; Maenaka, Katsumi; Sawa, Hirofumi; Sato, Akihiko",Sci Rep,,569

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from Indian orthopaedic surgeons. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The extent of anxiety and sleep quality was assessed by the standardised seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, single-item sleep quality scale, questions on unavailability of personal protective equipment, training module on COVID-19 and change in orthopaedic patient management. RESULTS: One hundred male orthopaedic surgeons responded to the survey with majority (79%) in 30-44 years age group. Severe anxiety scores were observed in 8%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12%, 27% and 53% surgeons respectively. Changes in management practice due to the pandemic was admitted by 65% respondents. We also observed an association between higher anxiety among surgeons and primary or secondary level of healthcare facility: (p = 0.04). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with change in management practice to non-operative procedures (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Anxiety among orthopaedic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to factors like younger age group, working in a primary or secondary healthcare facility. Early recognition of anxiety is essential to prevent serious psychological sequelae.","Sharma, Vyom; Kumar, Narinder; Gupta, Bhawna; Mahajan, Akanksha",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),,569

With inhomogeneous physical systems in mind, but also anticipating interdisciplinary applications, we present the model on network structures of varying degrees of complexity. We solve it for the generic case of power-law spin strength and find that, with a self-averaging free energy, the model has a rich phase diagram with new universality classes. Indeed, the degree of complexity added by variable spins is on a par to that added by endowing simple networks with increasingly realistic geometries. It is suitable for modeling emergent phenomena in many-body systems in contexts where non-identicality of spins or agents plays an essential role and for exporting statistical physics concepts beyond physics.","Krasnytska, Mariana; Berche, Bertrand; Holovatch, Yurij; Kenna, Ralph; Nous, Camille",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05134v1.pdf,569

351072,Data-Driven Decision-Making in COVID-19 Response: A Survey,2021,"Myxoma virus (MV) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) are the major causes of lethal viral diseases in the European rabbit. In 2010, a new RHDV genotype (RHDV2) emerged in the field that had limited cross-protection with the classical RHDV (RHDV1). For optimal protection of rabbits and preventing spread of disease, a vaccine providing protection against all three key viruses would be ideal. Therefore, a novel trivalent myxoma vectored RHDV vaccine (Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS) was developed similar to the existing bivalent myxoma vectored RHDV vaccine Nobivac Myxo-RHD. The new vaccine contains the Myxo-RHDV1 strain already included in Nobivac Myxo-RHD and a similarly produced Myxo-RHDV2 strain. This paper describes several key safety and efficacy studies conducted for European licensing purposes. Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS showed to be safe for use in rabbits from five weeks of age onwards, including pregnant rabbits, and did not spread from vaccinated rabbits to in-contact controls. Furthermore, protection to RHDV1 and RHDV2 was demonstrated by challenge, while the serological response to MV was similar to that after vaccination with Nobivac Myxo-RHD. Therefore, routine vaccination with Nobivac Myxo-RHD PLUS can prevent the kept rabbit population from these major viral diseases.","Reemers, Sylvia; Peeters, Leon; van Schijndel, Joyce; Bruton, Beth; Sutton, David; van der Waart, Leo; van de Zande, Saskia",,,569

The pandemic puts health services, including cardiac surgery units, under escalating pressure. There are significant challenges caused by this novel virus and ensuing disease that leads to great uncertainty. While it has been advocated to delay elective surgeries, most cardiac surgical patients present in a more urgent manner which elevates the critical nature for intervention, which may make the surgical decision inevitable. To date, no definitive treatments to the pandemic have been promoted. Cardiac surgical centers may experience an increasing number of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice. Preparation for managing these patients will require a change in the current modalities for perioperative care. Therefore, the goal of this report is to share our own experiences, combined with a review of the emerging literature, by highlighting principles for the adult cardiac surgery community regarding treatment of patients scheduled for surgery. The following report will recommend perioperative guidance in patient management to include safety precautions for the heart team, the conduct of extracorporeal circulation and related equipment, and covering the early period in intensive care in the context of the current pandemic.","Gunaydin, Serdar; Stammers, Alfred H",Perfusion,,569

We report a case of cervical abscess in an infant with COVID-19 who was first considered to have MIS-C due to persistent fever, high inflammatory markers. A 10-month-old boy was admitted to the emergency department due to a 3-day fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the nasopharyngeal swab specimen of the patient. Regarding initial clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed to have MIS-C and bacterial co-infection. Clindamycin and ceftriaxone treatments were initiated for bacterial co-infection. Despite treatment, his fever persisted and acute phase reactants compatible with MIS-C were elevated and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. After IVIG treatment, his fever persisted and the patient developed local inflammatory signs including erythema, tenderness, fluctuation developed. Cervical ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the findings compatible with the cervical abscess. Drainage of the cervical abscess was performed by an otolaryngologist. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the abscess culture. After abscess drainage, fever and acute phase reactants declined. His nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the 7th day. He was discharged on the 21st day of hospitalization with full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of COVID-19 with cervical abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus in children had been reported previously. Bacterial co-infection should be kept in mind in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and showing MIS-C findings.","Yildirim Arslan, Sema; Sahbudak Bal, Zumrut; Guner Ozenen, Gizem; Bilen, Nimet Melis; Kurugol, Zafer; Ozkinay, Ferda",J. infect. chemother,,569

All of these have been well documented by international comparisons. Our largely privatized market-based system and medical-industrial complex have been ill equipped to respond effectively to the pandemic. The accompanying economic downturn exacerbates these problems that further reveal the failures of our largely for-profit private health insurance industry, dependent as it is on continued government subsidies while it profiteers on the backs of vulnerable Americans. This article brings historical perspective to these problems, and provides markers of the extent of our unpreparedness and ineffective response to the pandemic. Coherent national health and public health policies are urgently needed based on evidence-based science, not political pressures.

In this paper, we focused on participants’ thoughts and opinions of AI use during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a global crisis. Although there have been studies relating AI to COVID-19, there is insufficient in-depth understanding concerning the way people feel about AI utilization in the context of COVID-19. While there was mostly positive feedback that AI could help in the COVID-19 calamity, such as COVID-19 testing and monitoring vital signs, two out of 15 participants expressed doubt that AI could be successfully implemented in healthcare, and four out of 15 participants mentioned potential issues with this AI application.

However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and world-wide. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions. However, adjustment will not improve the accuracy of an individual test.","Sempos, Christopher T; Tian, Lu",Am. j. epidemiol,,569

Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample &#916;CT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","Liu, Yang; Liao, Wenjian; Wan, Lagen; Xiang, Tianxing; Zhang, Wei",Viral immunol,,569

In this work, a hydrogel was fabricated from hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS) and soy protein isolate (SPI) via the crosslinking of epichlorohydrin. Effects of SPI content on the structure, physical and biological properties of the prepared hydrogels were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, water uptake testing, mechanical properties testing, MTT assay, hemolysis ratio testing and routine blood coagulation test. The results indicated that the hydrogels showed high water uptake ability and compressive strength. The in vitro biocompatibility evaluation revealed that the hydrogel contains 30% SPI content (HCSH-30) could promote blood coagulation and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the hemostatic model of liver in New Zealand rabbit was applied to assess the hemostatic efficacy of the hydrogels. The results demonstrated that HCSH-30 stopped bleeding in 75±1.63 s and improved hemostasis as compared to medical gauze. Thus, the hydroxypropyl chitosan/soy protein isolate hydrogel is expected to be a potential candidate for effective hemorrhage control.","Zhao, Yanan; Xiao, Ao; Wu, Ping; Chen, Feixiang; Zhang, Qiang; Liang, Xiao; Han, Xinwei; Shi, Xiaowen; Li, Yinping; Chen, Yun",Tissue engineering.

Plant-based transient protein expression systems offer an advantageous alternative to costly mammalian cell culture-based systems and can perform posttranslational modifications due to the presence of an endomembrane system that is largely similar to that of the animal cell. Technological advances in expression vectors for transient expression in the last two decades have produced new plant expression systems with the flexibility and speed that cannot be matched by those based on mammalian or insect cell culture. The rapid and high-level protein production capability of transient expression systems makes them the optimal system to quickly and versatilely develop and produce vaccines against viruses such as 2019-nCoV that have sudden and unpredictable outbreaks. Here, expression of antiviral subunit vaccines in Nicotiana benthamiana plants via transient expression is demonstrated.","Esqueda, Adrian; Chen, Qiang",Methods Mol Biol,,569

366149,Graphs in the COVID-19 news: a mathematics audit of newspapers in Korea,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in December 2019. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to ""flatten the curve"" of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the individual and combined effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed, and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate and diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. We estimate that a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing alone is estimated to delay (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) but not to reduce the peak. The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses are limited in that they do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adoption of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.","Teslya, Alexandra; Pham, Thi Mui; Godijk, Noortje G; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E; Bootsma, Martin C J; Rozhnova, Ganna",PLoS Med,,569

367129,Toward an improved risk/crisis communication in this time of COVID-19 pandemic: a baseline study for Philippine local government units,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of randomising dissemination of the Germ Defence behaviour change website via GP practices across England UK. TRIAL DESIGN: A two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial implementing Germ Defence via GP practices compared with usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Setting: All Primary care GP practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 16 years and over who were granted access by participating GP practices. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: We will ask staff at GP practices randomised to the intervention arm to share the weblink to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice during the 4-month trial implementation period and care will otherwise follow current standard management. Germ Defence is an interactive website ( http://GermDefence.org/ ) employing behaviour change techniques and practical advice on how to reduce the spread of infection in the home. The coronavirus version of Germ Defence helps people understand what measures to take and when to take them to avoid infection. This includes hand washing, avoiding sharing rooms and surfaces, dealing with deliveries and ventilating rooms. Using behaviour change techniques, it helps users think through and adopt better home hygiene habits and find ways to solve any barriers, providing personalised goal setting and tailored advice that fits users' personal circumstances and problem solving to overcome barriers. Comparator: Patients at GP practices randomised to the usual care arm will receive current standard management for the 4-month trial period after which we will ask staff to share the link to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the effects of implementing Germ Defence on prevalence of all respiratory tract infection diagnoses during the 4-month trial implementation period. The secondary outcomes are: 1) incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses 2) incidence of COVID-19 symptom presentation 3) incidence of gastrointestinal infections 4) number of primary care consultations 5) antibiotic usage 6) hospital admissions 7) uptake of GP practices disseminating Germ Defence to their patients 8) usage of the Germ Defence website by individuals who were granted access by their GP practice RANDOMISATION: GP practices will be randomised on a 1:1 basis by the independent Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). Clinical Commission Groups (CCGs) in England will be divided into blocks according to region, and equal numbers in each block will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be generated in Stata statistical software by a statistician not otherwise involved in the enrolment of general practices into the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The principal investigators, the statistician and study collaborators will remain blinded from the identity of randomised practices until the end of the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): To detect planned effect size (based on PRIMIT trial, Little et al, 2015): 11.1 million respondents from 6822 active GP practices. Assuming 25% of these GP practices will engage, we will contact all GP practices in England spread across 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0, dated 13 January 2021. Implementation is ongoing. The implementation period started on 10 November 2020 and will end on 10 March 2021.

Older adults are specifically vulnerable with regard to severe courses of the disease and have been particularly encouraged to self-isolate during the pandemic. Subsequently, expressions of concern have been raised regarding the negative impact of disease risk and quarantine on the mental health of older people. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of psychosocial stress, coping strategies, need for support, and sense of coherence of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study follows a qualitative research design. Between May and June 2020 Nâ¯= 11 guided telephone interviews were conducted with older adults (70+ years). Telephone interviews were recorded by audio tape and fully transcribed. A qualitative content analysis was performed according to Mayring and Fenzl (2019) using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Participants were 74.8 years old on average. Participants showed predominantly good psychosocial health and functional coping strategies. Life experience, an optimistic attitude, understanding of the necessity of restrictions, and previous crises that have been mastered were the most important resources during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. Offers of support were rarely used. Participants were critical of the closing of centers or meeting points for older people. CONCLUSION: Older adults appear to be able to preserve their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relevance of mental resources of older adults for supporting younger generations seems to be unrecognized.","Welzel, Franziska D; Schladitz, Katja; Förster, Franziska; Löbner, Margrit; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,569
368278,The dynamics of public discourse during the coronavirus pandemic: a request for responsibility,2020,"A year following the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, many countries have approved emergency vaccines. Public-health practitioners and policymakers must understand the predicted populational willingness for vaccines and implement relevant stimulation measures. This study developed a framework for predicting vaccination uptake rate based on traditional clinical data-involving an autoregressive model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)- and innovative web search queries-involving a linear regression with ordinary least squares/least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and machine-learning with boost and random forest. For accuracy, we implemented a stacking regression for the clinical data and web search queries. The stacked regression of ARIMA (1,0,8) for clinical data and boost with support vector machine for web data formed the best model for forecasting vaccination speed in the US. The stacked regression provided a more accurate forecast. These results can help governments and policymakers predict vaccine demand and finance relevant programs.","Zhou, Xingzuo; Li, Yiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13971v1.pdf,569

368656,An explorative study of corporate travellers’ perception at a German airport,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common general surgical emergency. Early laparoscopic appendicectomy is the gold-standard management. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) brought concerns of increased perioperative mortality and spread of infection during aerosol generating procedures: as a consequence, conservative management was advised, and open appendicectomy recommended when surgery was unavoidable. This study describes the impact of the first weeks of the pandemic on the management of AA in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Patients 18 years or older, diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically with AA were eligible for inclusion in this prospective, multicentre cohort study. Data was collected from 23rd March 2020 (beginning of the UK Government lockdown) to 1st May 2020 and included: patient demographics, COVID status; initial management (operative and conservative); length of stay; and 30-day complications. Analysis was performed on the first 500 cases with 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: The patient cohort consisted of 500 patients from 48 sites. The median age of this cohort was 35 [26-49.75] years and 233 (47%) of patients were female. Two hundred and seventy-one (54%) patients were initially treated conservatively; with only 26 (10%) cases progressing to an operation. Operative interventions were performed laparoscopically in 44% (93/211). Median length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the conservatively managed group (2 [IQR 1-4] days vs. 3 [2-4], p < 0.001). At 30 days, complications were significantly higher in the operative group (p < 0.001), with no deaths in any group. Of the 159 (32%) patients tested for COVID-19 on admission, only 6 (4%) were positive. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has changed the management of acute appendicitis in the UK, with non-operative management shown to be safe and effective in the short-term. Antibiotics should be considered as the first line during the pandemic and perhaps beyond.","Javanmard-Emamghissi, H; Boyd-Carson, H; Hollyman, M; Doleman, B; Adiamah, A; Lund, J N; Clifford, R; Dickerson, L; Richards, S; Pearce, L; Cornish, J; Hare, S; Lockwood, S; Moug, S J; Tierney, G M",Tech. coloproctol,,569

369942,Spatio-temporal concentration of atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) during pandemic: A study on most polluted cities of indo-gangetic plain,2021,"Introduction: Many ICU's in the United States do not have intensivist coverage and all procedures typically performed by intensivists are done by other specialties. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is commonly performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) at bedside for long-term ventilator support. In this study, we aim to describe our experience with PDT with both endoscopic and USG guidance with the primary operator being a hospitalist or internal medicine residents or pulmonary(non critical care) medicine fellow with the supervisor being an intensivist with training in PDT Methods: A total of 26 PDTs were performed using both bronchoscopy and USG guidance. Prior to the procedure, anatomical landmarks, including the thyroid cartilage, crico-thyroid membrane and tracheal rings, were identified using USG. The distance of the trachea from skin was checked and absence of a high innominate artery as well as other vascular anomalies was confirmed with USG. A bronchoscope inserted through the endotracheal tube (ETT) was used to pull the ETT out just distal to the vocal cords. Bronchoscopic visualization was also used to confirm a midline puncture and to avoid puncture of the posterior tracheal wall. After cannulation, the bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube to confirm adequate distance from the carina. A post-procedure USG was performed to check for the absence of a pneumothorax. Results:The average BMI of patients was 28 with an average age of 72. 2 patients were therapeutically anticoagulated and three patients were on clopidogrel. 5 patients had COVID 19 ARDS. Accidental decannulation was noted in 2 patients early on in the course and the procedure modified to include sutures through the tracheostomy holder along with a tracheostomy tie, following which there were no recurrences. 1 patient had persistent oozing which needed treatment with lidcoaine with epinephrine. No pneumothorax, tracheoinnominate fistula or stenosis post decannulation was noted. There was a 46% in hospital mortality but not related to procedural complications Discussion: Conventional/surgical tracheostomy involves more personnel and increases cost. Bronchoscopy and USG guidance help ensure reduction in major complications described with the procedure when compared to surgical tracheostomies. This pilot feasibility and safety analysis paves the way for teams without full time intensivists to perform more PDTs and collect further data to prove the safety and cost effective performance of PDTs.","Singh, K.; Qadir, A.; Bhat, P.; Smart, L.; Ejaz, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,569
370095,Introduction to the special issue on COVID-19: Economic and financial effects,2021,"Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a key concern, and evaluating the effect of testing and infection prevention and control strategies is essential for guiding policy in this area. Using a within-hospital SEIR transition model of SARS-CoV-2 in a typical English hospital, we estimate that between 9 March 2020 and 17 July 2020 approximately 20% of infections in inpatients, and 73% of infections in healthcare workers (HCWs) were due to nosocomial transmission. Model results suggest that placing suspected COVID-19 patients in single rooms or bays has the potential to reduce hospital-acquired infections in patients by up to 35%. Periodic testing of HCWs has a smaller effect on the number of hospital-acquired COVID-19 cases in patients, but reduces infection in HCWs by as much as 37% and results in only a small proportion of staff absences (approx. 0.3% per day). This is considerably less than the 20-25% of staff that have been reported to be absent from work owing to suspected COVID-19 and self-isolation. Model-based evaluations of interventions, informed by data collected so far, can help to inform policy as the pandemic progresses and help prevent transmission in the vulnerable hospital population. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling that shaped the early COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK'.","Evans, S.; Agnew, E.; Vynnycky, E.; Stimson, J.; Bhattacharya, A.; Rooney, C.; Warne, B.; Robotham, J.",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,,569
370586,Converting to a Synchronous Virtual Nursing Research Conference Amidst a Pandemic: A Case Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of adolescents are coming out as transgender and gender expansive (TGE). These teenagers have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes than their cisgender peers. Hypotheses to explain this discrepancy are based on increased stress levels surrounding the societal acceptance of gender identity. In this context, elevated allostatic load (AL), which describes the wear and tear sustained by the body in response to repeated exposure to stress, has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to measure AL among TGE adolescents compared with their cisgender peers and assess how AL varies depending on psychological stress and perceived societal acceptance. METHODS: This is an observational proof-of-concept pilot study in which AL will be measured by assaying an array of inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in urine, saliva, and hair samples of TGE youth, and these parameters will be compared with those of age-matched control participants. A questionnaire will assess 4 aspects of psychosocial well-being: presence and management of depression and anxiety, gender identity support by family members, gender minority stress, and degree of perceived safety in the surrounding community. Samples and surveys will be collected at 3 visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). This study will incorporate TGE coinvestigators to inform all aspects of design, data collection, and analysis and ensure that practices are carried out in a respectful and sensitive manner. RESULTS: As of May 2021, the start of data collection for this project has continued to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has both impacted the functioning of the clinic and funding requests. We hope to begin participant recruitment and interviews with coinvestigators soon. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that AL will be primarily influenced by psychological well-being and perceived support and that it will be similar in TGE adolescents and in age-matched cisgender control participants when acceptance and perceived support are high. The results of this study have the potential to increase our understanding of the health challenges faced by TGE individuals during adolescence as well as to show that low levels of acceptance may have detrimental health outcomes secondary to elevated ALs; this may lead to the development of a biomarker profile to assess allostatic stress in TGE patients that can be used to guide management.

Used recursively, a sequence of Boolean lattices with decreasing order is generated---a structure that is similar to an MRA. A second operator, which is a special case of a""difference operator"", is introduced that operates on consecutive Boolean lattices L_2^n and L_2^{n-1} to produce a sequence of orthocomplemented lattices. These two sequences, together with the subset ordering relation, form a primorial lattice P. A logic or probability constructed on a Boolean lattice L_2^N likewise induces a primorial lattice P. Such a logic or probability can then be rendered at N different""resolutions""by selecting any one of the N Boolean lattices in P and at N different""frequencies""by selecting any of the N different orthocomplemented lattices in P. Furthermore, P can be used for symbolic sequence analysis by projecting sequences of symbols onto the sublattices in P using one of three lattice projectors introduced. P can be used for symbolic sequence processing by judicious rejection and selection of projected sequences. Examples of symbolic sequences include sequences of logic values, sequences of probabilistic events, and genomic sequences (as used in""genomic signal processing"").","Greenhoe, Daniel J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4830v1.pdf,569
371862,Editors' Note,2021,"Both environmental risks and domestic violence exist in all countries of the world. This phenomenon is influenced by various factors: standard of living, ecological situation, environment, traditions, race, nationality and cultural values. This must be taken into account when imposing an appropriate punishment for commission of any illegal act. At the same time, family and domestic violence is not just a negative attribute of life of individual families, but also indicates serious issues of society, in the narrow sense, and the environment, in the broad sense. In connection with restrictions related to Covid-19 introduced in many countries, the level of domestic violence has increased, which proves a direct dependence on external negative factors in the field of health care, ecology, psychology, etc. Analysis of various factors influencing domestic violence has shown that this phenomenon has a high level of latency, and, as a rule, people learn about it only in cases where the consequences of such violence are difficult to hide due to their severity (for example, causing death or serious harm to health against the background of mental deviation). Having reviewed the news feeds over the past five years we can see that the relevance of the topic under consideration is beyond doubt, since the influence of environmental factors on the human psyche is not fully understood, and this aspect, one way or another, leads to the commission of illegal actions, which indicates the importance of balance between the environment, ecology and legality, society. The authors note that there is a synergistic relationship in which humanity interacts with the surrounding world, in all its diversity (water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, etc.). n addition, some judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on environmental problems and the environment, protection from domestic violence, including with the participation of Russian Federation as a defendant, were considered. Based on the analysis of the decisions expressed, as well as the norms of national legislation, a theoretical justification for changing the national criminal and environmental legislation, in terms of imposition of punishment, is formulated. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Sokolova, A.; Grunin, A.; Lukanin, V.; Shemarov, V.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",,569

The specialists of the De Martinis Telemedicine Panel, addressing e-health issues, have been responding to the requests of general practitioners in 14 municipalities of Marche region, by implementing the televideoconsultation to 98 patients, 68 of whom with, certain, probable or supposed to be CoViD-19 infection. The patients were managed from remote until the symptoms were over. Sixty-five patients adhere the televideoconsultation completely and were cured, also with home oxygen therapy and other treatments additional to the standard anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs. However, they got stuck to full isolation while making use of no external human resources for health and relying entirely on the electronic prescription of their general practitioner and the help of the cohabiting family members. Two patients abandoned, including one owing to the lack of support from the cohabiting family member, and addressed themselves to the hospital care. However, they required no mechanical ventilation and were discharged being recovered within shortly. One over 90 years' old patient was hospitalised in agreement with the general practitioner for management problems.

ResultsA total of 893 students participated. Depression and anxiety levels were higher at all timepoints than pre-pandemic normative data (p<.001). Scores on all mental health measures were highest in February, with depression and anxiety remaining significantly higher in March than baseline. Female students and those with previous mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Lower positive mood and greater loneliness at baseline were associated with greater depression and anxiety at follow-ups. Baseline positive mood predicted improvement of depression and anxiety at follow-ups.

Results indicate considerable differences between Korea and Japan in their monetary policy transmission channels. Conventional monetary policy transmission channels, such as the exchange rate channel, asset price channel, and bank lending channel, works relatively well in Japan. However, in Korea, the interest rate channel is effective but has only a short-term effect on the exchange rate, and the effects on asset prices and bank lending are hard to expect in general. Furthermore, some potential risks working through the housing market may hinder financial stability. Korea and Japan see a limited effect on production in the real sector.

SARS-CoV-2 enters macrophages through its Spike-protein aided by cathepsin (Cat) B and L, which also mediate SASP production. Since M-CSF and IL-34 control macrophage differentiation, we investigated the age-dependent effects of the Spike-protein on SASP-related pro-inflammatory-cytokines and nuclear-senescence-regulatory-factors, and CatB, L and K, in mouse M-CSF- and IL-34-differentiated macrophages. The Spike-protein upregulated SASP expression in young and aged male M-CSF-macrophages. In contrast, only young and aged male IL-34-macrophages demonstrated significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in response to the Spike-protein in vitro. Furthermore, the S-protein elevated CatB expression in young male M-CSF-macrophages and young female IL-34-macrophages, whereas CatL was overexpressed in young male IL-34- and old male M-CSF-macrophages.

Our study focused on the foreign-imported COVID-19 cases to provide detailed data for insights into the prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and control of imported COVID-19. Methods: For this observational and retrospective study, we investigated the clinical characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases that were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the Xi'an Public Health Center from 29 March 2020 to 31 August 2020. Results: Of the 79 patients with COVID-19, 19 (24.1%) had exposure to confirmed COVID-19 patients, 15 (19.0%) had exposure to suspicious COVID-19 patients, and 45 (56.9%) had an unclear history of exposure to confirmed patients. The mean age of the patients was 38 years, and 70 (88.7%) patients were male. Except for 2 severe cases, the remaining 58 (73.4%) cases displayed mild or moderate symptoms, and 19 (24.2%) infected patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-one (26.6%) patients were not diagnosed until a third or later nucleic acid test. Ten (12.7%) patients had chronic diseases. The most common manifestations of the patients were cough [18 (22.8%) cases], fever [9 (11.4%) cases] and sore throat [9 (11.4%) cases]. Forty-one (51.9%) cases showed abnormal chest CT images, To date, all patients have been discharged, and no patient has died. Conclusion: The imported COVID-19 cases in Xi'an were mainly young and middle-aged adults with mild or moderate symptoms who had a low rate of comorbidity, showed favourable laboratory and chest CT images, and had a better prognosis. Notably, for suspected COVID-19 cases, at least three consecutive nucleic acid tests should be carried out to avoid missed detection of infected patients.

376372,Leveraging Twitter data to analyze the virality of Covid-19 tweets: a text mining approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: The clinical and imaging features of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that progressed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been explored in numerous studies. However, little is known about these features in patients who received negative respiratory nucleic acid test results after the infections resolved. In this study, we aim to describe these features in a group of Chinese patients. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 51 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (median age: 34.0 years and 47.1% male) between January 31 and February 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected before and after two consecutive negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 tests. RESULTS: Following a negative test result, the patients' clinical symptoms continued to recover, but abnormal imaging findings were observed in all moderate cases. Specifically, 77.4% of patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited multi-lobar lung involvement and lesions were more frequently observed in the lower lobes. The most common CT imaging manifestations were ground-glass opacities (51.6%) and fibrous stripes (54.8%%). Twelve of the 31 patients with moderate COVID-19 underwent repeated chest CT scans after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Among them, the ground-glass opacities decreased by > 60% within 1 week in seven patients (58.3%), but by < 5% in four patients (13.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Following a positive and subsequent negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, patients with COVID-19 continued to recover despite exhibiting persistent clinical symptoms and abnormal imaging findings.","Rong, Yan; Wang, Fei; Tian, Jinfei; Liang, Xinhua; Wang, Jing; Li, Xiaoli; Zhang, Dandan; Liu, Jing; Zeng, Huadong; Zhou, Yang; Shi, Yi",BMC Infect Dis,,569

377616,Visiting Subinternships in Wake of the COVID-19 Crisis: An Opportunity for Improvement,2020,"Aims: Rational use of antibiotics against the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic Objective: Repositioning and repurposing adequate antibiotics to cure the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Background: It is widely accepted that viral infections such as the SARS-CoV-2 cannot be cured by antibiotics, whereas bacterial infections can It is because the SARS-CoV-2 virus has no protein synthesis machinery (usually targeted by antibiotics) to produce from its RNA genome, the viral proteins and enzymes essential for its replication and/or for the assembly of viral particles However, the antibiotics must be capable of inhibiting the ribosomes of the protein synthesis machinery of the SARS-CoV-2-infected human host cells, in order to prevent them from synthesizing new proteins that they do not need, but are needed for the virus to spread Unfortunately, the only antibiotic capable of selectively inhibiting the human 80S ribosomes, namely cycloheximide, was found to be a poisonous drug for the mammals Therefore, the only possibility is to search for the antibiotics that are capable of inhibiting both bacterial and eukaryal ribosomes, in order to prevent at the same time the ribosomes of the infected human host cells from synthesizing the proteins and enzymes for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and those of the eventual opportunistic pathogenic bacteria from developing pneumonia Methods: First, we have used a molecular modeling study involving the tools of the semi-empirical quantum mechanics PM3 method to study the interaction between the cation Zn++ and all the molecules considered as zinc transporters in this report By this approach, the niche in which Zn++ is located was determined Such an interaction serves as a shuttle and allows zinc cation to invade endocellular structures in the SARS-CoV-2-infected human host cells Second, we have measured the poly (U)-dependent poly (Phe) synthesis activity of human 80S ribosomes in the presence of increasing concentrations of four antibiotics of the class of the macrolides, namely erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin This experiment led us to determine for each macrolide, the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) that is the concentration of antibiotic corresponding to 50% inhibition of the activity of the human 80S ribosomes Finally, we have analyzed previously published data from the group of Nierhaus (Berlin) on the competition between the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA and the antibiotic tetracycline for the binding to the ribosomal A-site on the E coli 70S or rabbit liver 80S ribosomes This led to the conclusion by the authors that tetracycline most likely binds to corresponding sites in 70S and 80S ribosomes with comparable affinity Results: We propose to reposition the macrolides (azithromycin or erythromycin or others) and tetracyclines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, on account of the following data gathered in this report First, these antibiotics are already currently successfully used in medicine in humans and animals Second, the binding sites of these antibiotics at the upper part of the protein exit tunnel (for the macrolides) and the ribosomal A-site (for tetracyclines) are universally conserved features of the ribosomes in all kingdoms of life So, these classes of antibiotics are expected to bind to all kinds of ribosomes, the 70S as well as the 80S type, with comparable affinity Therefore, they are capable of preventing at the same time the ribosomes of the infected human host cells from synthesizing the proteins and enzymes for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and those of the eventual opportunistic pathogenic bacteria from developing pneumonia Third, the efficacy assessment of these antibiotics in clinical application consisted of comparing their affinity constants of binding to the human ribosomes with their blood concentration For example, in the case of azithromycin, the amount of antibiotic administered to COVID-19 patients was 100 μg/ml of circulating blood, which is 43 times superior to the half-inhibito y oncentration (IC50 or KIa of 2 3 μg/ml), the concentration of azithromycin corresponding to 50% inhibition of the activity of the human 80S ribosomes Fourth, zinc cations were previously shown to be a strong antiviral agent, while all the macrolides and tetracyclines that we propose for repurposing or repositioning to cure the COVID-19 are shown in the present report to form Zn++-antibiotic complex and behave as efficient zinc transporters into the SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells Conclusion: The macrolides (azithromycin or erythromycin or others) and tetracyclines selected for repositioning and repurposing to cure COVID-19 are candidates as specific and effective therapeutic drugs available for the coronavirus disease We propose to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic with azithromycin or erythromycin (or equivalent) alone or in combination with tetracycline (or equivalent) in the presence of Zn++(SO4--) Taking into account the fact that azithromycin had been shown to be effective in treating viral infections such as papillomaviruses in humans and dogs, we conclude that the statement “no antibiotic for viral infections !” is not relevant for all the clinically approved classes of antibiotics, because selective antibiotics such as the universal antibiotics described in the present report are capable of exhibiting antiviral activities through specific interactions with the human 80S ribosomes of infected host cells As a conclusion, even though the clinical and experimental data presented here do not suggest virucidal activity of azithromycin-zinc or tetracycline-zinc complexes, they do indicate that when administered simultaneously at the onset of first signs of COVID-19, the most common symptoms being fatigue, fever, dry cough, headache, sore throat, muscle pain or shortness of breath, azithromycin (or tetracycline) and zinc cations are capable of inhibiting ribosomal activity of SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells This results in blocking protein and enzyme synthesis vital for viral RNA replication and for assembly of viral particles Early treatment allows both reductions of viremia as well as stabilizing symptoms The major advantage of this therapeutic strategy is avoiding prolonged clinical COVID-19 disease with contingent worsening of illness and subsequent need for intensive care Prolonged COVID-19 illness is the major downfall of the present pandemic, returning to normal being long, difficult, and sometimes impossible © 2021 Hountondji et al","Hountondji, C.; Besnaïnou, G.; Gaudet, E.;

379785,The Effects of Feedback Modality on Performance,2020,"The Novel-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. To reduce the spread of the virus, Americans were asked to physically distance and to increase disinfecting behaviors such as hand washing. Previous research indicates that one's mindset about health, or the degree to which they view health as fixed or modifiable, influences health behaviors. Current data indicates that American Indians (AIs) are at greater risk for COVID-19. As such, it is important to understand whether mindsets about health may affect behaviors which could prevent spread of the virus in AIs. In this exploratory investigation, a convenience sample of two hundred AI adults completed a questionnaire one month prior to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. They provided demographic information and completed a measure of health mindsets. The second wave of data was collected approximately one month later, where we collected a measure of physical distancing behavior and a measure of disinfecting behaviors. In AI adults, health mindset predicted frequency of physical distancing behaviors and disinfecting behaviors, with individuals who viewed health as less fixed engaging in more physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, while individuals who viewed health as more fixed reported less physical distancing and less disinfecting behaviors. In AIs, growth health mindsets predicted physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, both of which are important in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Interventions which are designed to promote growth mindsets of health may promote health-protective behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","John-Henderson, Neha A; Mueller, Claudia M",PLoS One,,569

382357,Furloughs: Weighing the Unemployment Costs and Benefits (preprint),2020,"Cardiovascular (CV) engagement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge determinant of prognosis during the acute phase of the disease. However, little is known about the potential chronic implications of the late phase of COVID-19 and about the appropriate approach to these patients. Heart failure, type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, and thrombosis have been shown to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and a 'long COVID-19' illness has been recognized with fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnoea among the most frequent symptoms reported after discharge from hospital. This paper focuses on some open questions that cardiologists are going to face during the next months in a general cardiology outpatient clinic, in particular how to evaluate a 'post-COVID' patient during follow-up of CV complications of the acute phase and how to manage new CV symptoms that could be the consequence, at least in part, of heart/vessels and/or lung involvement of the previous virus infection. Present symptoms and signs, history of previous CV disease (both preceding COVID-19 and occurring during viral infection), and specific laboratory and imaging measurements during the acute phase may be of interest in focusing on how to approach the clinical evaluation of a post-COVID patient and how to integrate in our standard of care the new information on COVID-19, possibly in a multidisciplinary view. Dealing with the increased COVID-associated CV risk burden and becoming acquainted with potential new e-cardiology approaches aimed at integrating the cardiology practice are relevant new challenges brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and its sequelae.","Richter, Dimitrios; Guasti, Luigina; Koehler, Friedrich; Squizzato, Alessandro; Nistri, Stefano; Christodorescu, Ruxandra; Dievart, Francois; Gaudio, Giovanni; Asteggiano, Riccardo; Ferrini, Marc",ESC Heart Fail,,569

In this study, we aimed to compare diagnostic performance, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, of POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 infections in patients submitting to the emergency room (ER). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 93 patients with a suspected COVID-19 infection, admitted to the ER between March 28th and April 20th, 2020. Test subjects showed one or more symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, for which consequent COVID-19 testing was achieved using POCUS lung, chest CT, and RT-PCR. CT images were analyzed by 2 radiologists blinded to RT-PCR results. POCUS lung was performed by three emergency medical doctors, and reports were analyzed by the researcher, blinded to clinical information, US imaging, CT, and RT-PCR test results. RESULTS: Compared with RT-PCR, POCUS lung demonstrated outstanding sensitivity and NPV (93.3% and 94.1% respectively) while showing poor values for specificity, PPV, and accuracy (21.3%, 19.2%, and 33.3% respectively). In contrast, similar inquiries using chest CT as index test, excellent sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and accuracy (80.0%, 86.7%, 95.6%, and 85.6%, respectively) were reported, beside a moderate value for PPV (54.5%). CONCLUSION: POCUS may provide early ER triage with a useful, rapid, low-threshold, and safe screening tool in evaluating possible COVID-19 infections. Due to limited specificity, suggestive POCUS lung findings should be confirmed with RT-PCR or chest CT.","Narinx, Nick; Smismans, Annick; Symons, Rolf; Frans, Johan; Demeyere, Annick; Gillis, Marc",Emerg Radiol,,569

Here, we use an individual-based model (STRIDE) to simulate interactions between 11 million inhabitants of Belgium at different levels including extended household settings, i.e., ""household bubbles"". The burden of COVID-19 is impacted by both the intensity and frequency of physical contacts, and therefore, household bubbles have the potential to reduce hospital admissions by 90%. In addition, we find that it is crucial to complete contact tracing 4 days after symptom onset.

382850,Quantifying Repugnance to Price Gouging with An Incentivized Reporting Experiment (preprint),2020,"Substantial health disparities exist across race/ethnicity in the USA, with Black Americans often most affected. The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. While there have been ample studies describing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, relatively few have established an empirical link between these disparities and structural racism. Such empirical analyses are critically important to help defuse ""victim-blaming"" narratives about why minority communities have been badly hit by COVID-19. In this paper, we explore the empirical link between structural racism and disparities in county-level COVID-19 outcomes by county racial composition. Using negative binomial regression models, we examine how five measures of county-level residential segregation and racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes as well as incarceration rates are associated with county-level COVID-19 outcomes. We find significant associations between higher levels of measured structural racism and higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, even after adjusting for county-level population sociodemographic characteristics, measures of population health, access to healthcare, population density, and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. One percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.1% increase in county case rate. This association decreased to 0.4% when structural racism indicators were included in our model. Similarly, one percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.8% increase in county death rates, which became non-significant after adjustment for structural racism. Our findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that structural racism is an important driver of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and reinforce existing calls for action to address structural racism as a fundamental cause of health disparities.","Tan, Shin Bin; deSouza, Priyanka; Raifman, Matthew",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,569

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicentre, observational, nationwide survey to collect data on admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at Italian CCUs throughout a 1 week period during the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with the equivalent week in 2019. We observed a 48.4% reduction in admissions for AMI compared with the equivalent week in 2019 (P < 0.001). The reduction was significant for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI; 26.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7-32.3; P = 0.009] and non-STEMI (NSTEMI; 65.1%, 95% CI 60.3-70.3; P < 0.001). Among STEMIs, the reduction was higher for women (41.2%; P = 0.011) than men (17.8%; P = 0.191). A similar reduction in AMI admissions was registered in North Italy (52.1%), Central Italy (59.3%), and South Italy (52.1%). The STEMI case fatality rate during the pandemic was substantially increased compared with 2019 [risk ratio (RR) = 3.3, 95% CI 1.7-6.6; P < 0.001]. A parallel increase in complications was also registered (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8; P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Admissions for AMI were significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic across Italy, with a parallel increase in fatality and complication rates.

386059,Australian Industrial Relations and Covid-19,2020,"Europe is experiencing a third wave of COVID-19 due to the spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. A number of positive and negative factors constantly shape the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalization, and mortality. Among these factors, the rise in increasingly transmissible variants on one side and the effect of vaccinations on the other side create a picture deeply different from that of the first pandemic wave. Starting from the observation that in several European countries the number of COVID-19 infections in the second and third pandemic wave increased without a proportional rise in disease severity and mortality, we hypothesize the existence of an additional factor influencing SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. This factor consists of an immune defence against severe COVID-19, provided by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells progressively developing upon natural exposure to low virus doses present in populated environments. As suggested by recent studies, low-dose viral particles entering the respiratory and intestinal tracts may be able to induce T cell memory in the absence of inflammation, potentially resulting in different degrees of immunization. In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical interventions would play a double role, one in the short term by reducing the detrimental spreading of SARS-CoV-2 particles, and one in the long term by allowing the development of a widespread (although heterogeneous and uncontrollable) form of immune protection.","De Angelis, Maria Laura; Francescangeli, Federica; Rossi, Rachele; Giuliani, Alessandro; De Maria, Ruggero; Zeuner, Ann",Viruses,,569

By integrating temporal features into the encoder-decoder structure, transformers can processes the exercise information and student response information in a natural way. However, current state-of-the-art transformer-based variants still share two limitations. First, extremely long temporal features cannot well handled as the complexity of self-attention mechanism is O(n2). Second, existing approaches track the knowledge drifts under fixed a window size, without considering different temporal-ranges. To conquer these problems, we propose MUSE, which is equipped with multi-scale temporal sensor unit, that takes either local or global temporal features into consideration. The proposed model is capable to capture the dynamic changes in users knowledge states at different temporal-ranges, and provides an efficient and powerful way to combine local and global features to make predictions.

387248,"Working Remotely, Working Effectively: Improving Collection Access During a Global Pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Rapid, reliable, and widespread testing is required to curtail the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current gold standard nucleic acid tests are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor. METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples. RESULTS: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using three readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had accuracies greater than 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19.","Lalli, Matthew A; Langmade, S Joshua; Chen, Xuhua; Fronick, Catrina C; Sawyer, Christopher S; Burcea, Lauren C; Wilkinson, Michael N; Fulton, Robert S; Heinz, Michael; Buchser, William J; Head, Richard D; Mitra, Robi D; Milbrandt, Jeffrey",Clin. chem,,569

Four patients (50%) had short-term follow-up imaging within a median of 17 days after the first MR imaging; they developed brain atrophy, and their white matter lesions evolved into necrotizing cystic cavitations. All (8/8) patients had inflammatory cytokine release syndrome as demonstrated by elevated interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels. Most (7/8; 87.5%) patients were on prolonged ventilator support (median, 44.5 days; interquartile range, 20.5 days). These patients had poor functional outcomes (6/8 [75%] patients were discharged with mRS 5) and high mortality (2/8, 25%). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 can develop acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy that evolves into cystic degeneration of white matter lesions with brain atrophy during a short period, which we dubbed virus-associated necrotizing disseminated acute leukoencephalopathy. This may be the result of COVID-19-related endothelial injury, cytokine storm, or thrombotic microangiopathy.","Agarwal, S; Conway, J; Nguyen, V; Dogra, S; Krieger, P; Zagzag, D; Lewis, A; Melmed, K; Galetta, S; Jain, R",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,569
387343,Implementing economic and social rights in ‘domestic’ jurisdictions: understanding the minimum core obligations approach,2020,"Soon after reports of a novel coronavirus capable of causing severe pneumonia surfaced in late 2019, expeditious global spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) forced the World Health Organization to declare an international state of emergency. Although best known for causing symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in mild cases and fulminant pneumonia in severe disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also been associated with gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiac, and hematologic presentations. Despite concerns over poor specificity and undue radiation exposure, chest imaging nonetheless remains central to the initial diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 progression, as well as to the evaluation of complications. Classic features on chest CT include ground-glass and reticular opacities with or without superimposed consolidations, frequently presenting in a bilateral, peripheral, and posterior distribution. More recently, studies conducted with MRI have shown excellent concordance with chest CT in visualizing typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. For patients in whom exposure to ionizing radiation should be avoided, particularly pregnant patients and children, pulmonary MRI may represent a suitable alternative to chest CT. Although PET imaging is not typically considered among first-line investigative modalities for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, numerous reports have noted incidental localization of radiotracer in parenchymal regions of COVID-19-associated pulmonary lesions. These findings are consistent with data from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV cohorts which suggested an ability for 18F-FDG PET to detect subclinical infection and lymphadenitis in subjects without overt clinical signs of infection. Though highly sensitive, use of PET/CT for primary detection of COVID-19 is constrained by poor specificity, as well as considerations of cost, radiation burden, and prolonged exposure times for imaging staff. Even still, decontamination of scanner bays is a time-consuming process, and proper ventilation of scanner suites may additionally require up to an hour of downtime to allow for sufficient air exchange. Yet, in patients who require nuclear medicine investigations for other clinical indications, PET imaging may yield the earliest detection of nascent infection in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Especially for patients with concomitant malignancies and other states of immunocompromise, prompt recognition of infection and early initiation of supportive care is crucial to maximizing outcomes and improving survivability.","Fields, Brandon K K; Demirjian, Natalie L; Dadgar, Habibollah; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Semin. nucl. med,,569

387482,Turbulence of the Modern World through the Prism of the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded many existing healthcare delivery challenges including long waiting lists and cost containment. New challenges have arisen, such as demand on supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the implications of social distancing on staff, patients, and their families. Despite the pandemic, the need to deliver safe, urgent congenital cardiac surgery has remained. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how Lean methodology can improve PPE supply chain demand and reduce staff exposure to children with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We implemented the define, measure, analyze, improve, and control method (DMAIC) and Value Stream Maps to eliminate waste steps during testing for SARS-CoV-2 for children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Following a 3-week period of implementation of this new value stream map, we reduced PPE set usage from 13 to 1 per patient, resulting in an annual saving of over 36,000 and reducing single-use plastic waste by nearly 70 000 pieces per annum. We reduced numbers of staff exposed to patients with an unknown SARS-CoV-2 status from 13 to 1. CONCLUSION: The use of Lean methodology can reduce waste of PPE and plastic, resulting in cost savings, while reducing staff exposure when testing patients with congenital cardiac disease for SARS-CoV-2. By preventing admission of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, we can reduce use of isolation beds and prevent cancellation of surgery, improving patient flow and departmental efficiency. Other departments in our institution are implementing similar admission pathways to allow surgical services to restart during the ongoing pandemic.","Sheehan, John Robert; Lyons, Barry; Holt, Francesca",Paediatr Anaesth,,569

388712,Complete Remission in a Patient with Treatment Refractory Bullous Pemphigoid after a Single Dose of Omalizumab,2020,"Social distancing (SDIST) to contain COVID-19 pandemic spread implies reduced sunlight exposure and social daily life, which delay the circadian system and increase eveningness preference. The regular practice of physical activity (PA) is a time cue that decreased during SDIST. However, it is unknown if decreased PA may be associated with increase of eveningness preference. This study aimed to investigate if PA changes might be associated with changes in the morningness-eveningness preference of individuals practicing SDIST in Brazil. For this, 322 adults (18-89 years-old) regularly living in Brazil between March and October 2020 answered an online survey including questions considering the before and during SDIST period on PA (min/week) and morningness-eveningness questionnaire score. Sociodemographic, SDIST, anthropometric, and health characteristics were also included in the online survey. Participants self-reported an increase of eveningness preference comparing Before-SDIST with During-SDIST scores (56 ± 12 vs. 52 ± 13, p < .0001). Self-reported PA decreased comparing Before-SDIST with During-SDIST (230 ± 170 vs. 149 ± 155 min/week, p < .0001). Decrease in the total volume of PA and hours spent outside per day, and higher body mass index were associated with the increase in eveningness preference (R2 = .077), although the decrease in the total volume of PA was the strongest association (R2 = .037). In summary, our results show that SDIST may cause a delay in the circadian system, which is associated with the decrease of PA, a reduction in the hours spent outside per day with sunlight exposure, and obesity.","Oliveira, Gustavo F; Marin, Thais C; Apolinário, Nicolas; Rosa-Silva, Julia; Azevêdo, Luan; Ceciliato, Julio; Silva-Batista, Carla; Brito, Leandro C",Chronobiol Int,,569

The aim of this study was to explore the exposure-response relationship between daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and environmental factors. We used a time-series generalized additive model (GAM) to investigate the short-term association between COVID-19 and environmental factors by using daily meteorological elements, air pollutant concentration, and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to February 29, 2020, in Shanghai, China. We observed significant negative associations between daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and mean temperature (Tave), temperature humidity index (THI), and index of wind effect (K), whereas air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10 NO2, and SO2 were significantly associated with the increase in daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. A 1 °C increase in Tave, one-unit increase in THI, and 10-unit increase in K (lag 0-7 days) were associated with 4.7, 1.8, and 1.6% decrease in daily confirmed cases, respectively. Daily Tave, THI, K, PM10, and SO2 had significant lag and persistence (lag 0-7 days), whereas the lag and persistence of AQI, PM2.5, and NO2 were significant at both lag 0-7 and 0-14 days. A 10-µg/m3 increase in PM10 and 1-µg/m3 increase in SO2 was associated with 13.9 and 5.7% increase in daily confirmed cases at lag 0-7 days, respectively, whereas a 10-unit increase in AQI and a 10-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with 7.9, 7.8, and 10.1% increase in daily confirmed cases at lag 0-14 days, respectively.

389553,"Distress migration and employment in indigenous Odisha, India: Evidence from migrant-sending households",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services, reducing opportunities to conduct routine hepatitis C virus antibody screening, clinical care, and treatment. Therefore, people living with undiagnosed hepatitis C virus during the pandemic may later become identified at more advanced stages of the disease, leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates. Further, unidentified hepatitis C virus-infected individuals may continue to unknowingly transmit the virus to others. METHODS: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were evaluated from a large national reference clinical laboratory and from national estimates of dispensed prescriptions for hepatitis C virus treatment. Investigators estimated the average number of hepatitis C virus antibody tests, hepatitis C virus antibody-positive test results, and hepatitis C virus RNA-positive test results by month in January-July for 2018 and 2019, compared with the same months in 2020. To assess the impact of hepatitis C virus treatment, dispensed hepatitis C virus direct-acting antiretroviral medications were examined for the same time periods. Statistical analyses of trends were performed using negative binomial models. RESULTS: Compared with the 2018 and 2019 months, hepatitis C virus antibody testing volume decreased 59% during April 2020 and rebounded to a 6% reduction in July 2020. The number of hepatitis C virus RNA-positive results fell by 62% in March 2020 and remained 39% below the baseline by July 2020. For hepatitis C virus treatment, prescriptions decreased 43% in May, 37% in June, and 38% in July relative to the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, continued public health messaging, interventions and outreach programs to restore hepatitis C virus testing and treatment to prepandemic levels, and maintenance of public health efforts to eliminate hepatitis C infections remain important.","Kaufman, Harvey W; Bull-Otterson, Lara; Meyer, William A; Huang, Xiaohua; Doshani, Mona; Thompson, William W; Osinubi, Ademola; Khan, Mohammed A; Harris, Aaron M; Gupta, Neil; Van Handel, Michelle; Wester, Carolyn; Mermin, Jonathan; Nelson, Noele P",Am. j. prev. med,,569

The impetus of this article is to show that immunosenescence is a risk factor to COVID-19 and not aging per se. Based on the idea that some older people are also healthier than younger ones, the emphasis of this article is on immunosenescence and not aging as a risk factor of COVID-19 complications. The paper utilizes a biopsychosocial approach to expound on the link between immunosenescence and COVID-19 risk factors. The article explores biological factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, substance abuse, and sex. It also expands on psychosocial factors such as mental health disorders, homelessness, unemployment, lack of physical exercises, stigma, and discrimination. The article calls for gerontological social work to assume a developmental-clinical social work perspective to prevent the early onset and progression of immunosenescence. It calls for gerontological social work to prevent factors that promote unhealthy aging. The article promotes a preventative stance to practice and not just curative approaches. Treatment involves primary prevention which emphasizes on avoiding the onset of unhealthy aging. It is this approach that gerontological social work should aim also to address in building resilience in the face of pandemics.","Chigangaidze, Robert K; Chinyenze, Patience",J Gerontol Soc Work,,569

390976,Coronavirus pandemic-medical law and ethical issues in the United States,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic. The World Health Organization has also declared an infodemic (ie, a plethora of information regarding COVID-19 containing both false and accurate information circulated on the internet). Hence, it has become critical to test the veracity of information shared online and analyze the evolution of discussed topics among citizens related to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research analyzes the public discourse on COVID-19. It characterizes risk communication patterns in four Asian countries with outbreaks at varying degrees of severity: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 from four Asian countries in the early phase of the disease outbreak from January to March 2020. The data set was collected by relevant keywords in each language, as suggested by locals. We present a method to automatically extract a time-topic cohesive relationship in an unsupervised fashion based on natural language processing. The extracted topics were evaluated qualitatively based on their semantic meanings. RESULTS: This research found that each government's official phases of the epidemic were not well aligned with the degree of public attention represented by the daily tweet counts. Inspired by the issue-attention cycle theory, the presented natural language processing model can identify meaningful transition phases in the discussed topics among citizens. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper compares similarities and differences of pandemic-related social media discourse in Asian countries. We observed multiple prominent peaks in the daily tweet counts across all countries, indicating multiple issue-attention cycles. Our analysis identified which topics the public concentrated on; some of these topics were related to misinformation and hate speech. These findings and the ability to quickly identify key topics can empower global efforts to fight against an infodemic during a pandemic.","Park, Sungkyu; Han, Sungwon; Kim, Jeongwook; Molaie, Mir Majid; Vu, Hoang Dieu; Singh, Karandeep; Han, Jiyoung; Lee, Wonjae; Cha, Meeyoung",J Med Internet Res,,569

Despite this, there is no evidence that horizontal equity, with respect to income, was violated for NHS hospital outpatient and inpatient care during the first wave of the pandemic. There is evidence of pro-rich inequities in use of GP consultations, prescriptions and medical helplines at the peak of the first wave, but these were eliminated as the pandemic progressed.

To maintain a safe environment for all patients and staff, we established an admission screening plan of testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to determine the presence of asymptomatic patients who were infected with the virus upon admission. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 but were presumed to be COVID-19 negative at the time of admission to IRF in New Jersey. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing results. SETTING: Four freestanding IRFs in New Jersey operated as one system. PATIENTS: All (N = 103) patients sequentially admitted from 4 to 27 April 2020 with no symptoms or evidence of COVID-19 disease at the time of transfer from the acute hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis at the time of admission to the IRF and patients were monitored for subsequent symptom development over the next 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of SARS-CoV-2 testing upon admission and evidence of development of clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seven asymptomatic persons (6.8% of admissions) without clinical signs/symptoms of COVID-19 tested positive on admission. Of these, five developed symptoms of COVID-19, with a mean onset of 3.2 (range of 2-5) days. Five additional patients became symptomatic and tested positive within the next 3 to 10 days (mean of 5.2 days). Overall, 11.6% of admissions (12/103) had a positive test within 14 days of admission. CONCLUSIONS: Admission testing to postacute centers for SARS-CoV-2 can help identify presymptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, especially in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent. Negative results, however, do not preclude COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions.","Kirshblum, Steven C; DeLauter, Gabrielle; Lopreiato, Maeve C; Pomeranz, Bruce; Dawson, Amanda; Hammerman, Samuel; Gans, Bruce M",PM R,,569

394420,Collaboration during times of crisis,2020,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Africa, a large percentage of Africans were already affected by poverty and food insecurity. The pandemic wreaked havoc on their already unfavorable situation. The direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 included but not limited to illness and deaths of food systems' workers, interruption of food supply chains, unemployment, depreciation of currency value, and disruption of social protection programs. COVID-19 will lead to further economic fallout. Thus, the situation needs careful observation and timely intervention to safeguard the vulnerable African communities. Although Africa has sought ways to lessen the dire impact of the pandemic on food security, short-term solutions should include and enhance social and economic relief initiatives such as monetary intervention and social safety net. Considering a balance between health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions and their economic implications, the African countries, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. Africa's medium- and long-term strategies for improving food security should include improving and diversifying its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities. This will reduce Africa's dependence on importation of these key commodities, and will help the continent address underlying economic vulnerabilities and better manage food, pandemic, and/or health-related crises affecting food security in the long term.","Ali Mohamed, Esraa Mahadi; Alhaj Abdallah, Samar Mohammed; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,569

394463,Introduction to the special issue on Impact of COVID-19 and cryptocurrencies on the global financial market,2021,"Despite significant improvements over the last few years, cloud-based healthcare applications continue to suffer from poor adoption due to their limitations in meeting stringent security, privacy, and quality of service requirements (such as low latency). The edge computing trend, along with techniques for distributed machine learning such as federated learning, have gained popularity as a viable solution in such settings. In this paper, we leverage the capabilities of edge computing in medicine by analyzing and evaluating the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data at the edge allowing the remote healthcare centers, lacking advanced diagnostic facilities, to benefit from the multi-modal data securely. To this aim, we utilize the emerging concept of clustered federated learning (CFL) for an automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Such an automated system can help reduce the burden on healthcare systems across the world that has been under a lot of stress since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework under different experimental setups on two benchmark datasets. Promising results are obtained on both datasets resulting in comparable results against the central baseline where the specialized models (i.e., each on a specific type of COVID-19 imagery) are trained with central data, and improvements of 16\% and 11\% in overall F1-Scores have been achieved over the multi-modal model trained in the conventional Federated Learning setup on X-ray and Ultrasound datasets, respectively. We also discuss in detail the associated challenges, technologies, tools, and techniques available for deploying ML at the edge in such privacy and delay-sensitive applications.","Qayyum, Adnan; Ahmad, Kashif; Ahsan, Muhammad Ahtazaz; Al-Fuqaha, Ala; Qadir, Junaid",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07511v1.pdf,569

The study aimed to analyze the demand for seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) among various groups of HCWs in a tertiary care hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify their motives for this season's SIV. Before this influenza season (2020/21), the hospital management offered free SIV to all HCWs and promoted it on the internal network. Out of 4,167 HCWs, 630 HCWs expressed interest in SIV and were vaccinated in the hospital. They filled in a total of 603 self-administered pen-and-paper questionnaires. The mean age of the respondents (374 females and 229 males) was 45 ± 12 years. Physicians accounted for 48% of the vaccinated persons but for only 24% (p < .001) of all HCWs to whom SIV was offered. Only 16% of respondents vaccinated this year also received SIV before the last season (2019/20), with the proportion of physicians (19%) being statistically significantly higher than that of non-physicians (13%, p = .045) and the proportion of chronically ill HCWs (22%) being higher than that of healthy individuals (13%, p = .004). Most frequently, respondents' motivation to get vaccinated this year was self-protection (61%), that is concerns about contracting influenza together with COVID-19 or alone, followed by family protection (58%) and patient protection (53%). In conclusion, COVID-19 contributed to an increased demand for SIV among HCWs and the threat of contracting it together with influenza was the most frequent motive.","Stepánek, Ladislav; Nakládalová, Marie; Vildová, Helena; Boriková, Alena; Janosíková, Magdaléna; Ivanová, Katerina",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,569

We argue that, in addition to the presence of an RNA exonuclease (ExoN), two markers for the large size of viral RNA genomes are (i) the presence of one or more RNA methyltransferases (MTases) and (ii) a specific architecture of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase active site. We propose that RNA genome expansion and maintenance are driven by an evolutionary ménage-à-trois made of fast and processive RNA polymerases, RNA repair ExoNs, and RNA MTases that relates to the transition between RNA- to DNA-based life.","Ferron, François; Sama, Bhawna; Decroly, Etienne; Canard, Bruno",Trends biochem. sci,,569

It posed specific challenges in the context of initial teacher education (ITE) and inhibited teacher educators from physically observing pre-service teachers’ lessons on school placement. However, developments in virtual live-streaming technology facilitate student teachers’ lessons being observed by teacher educators in real-time without the need to visit schools. This paper reports on a study conducted in Ireland and Australia in the context of COVID-19 to evaluate emergency virtual observation (EVO) during school placement. Contextualised within teacher education in two University settings, the experience of EVO for a cohort of pre-service teachers and school placement tutors is explored. Findings present affordances and challenges, offering direction for initial teacher education school placement observation in a post-COVID era.

399009,The impact of the international crisis on the entrepreneurial intentions of refugees,2021,"On 11 March 2020, the (WHO) World Health Organization declared COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease 2019) as a pandemic. A further crisis has manifested mass fear and panic, driven by lack of information, or sometimes outright misinformation, alongside the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter is one of the prominent and trusted social media in this current outbreak. Over time, boundless COVID-19 headlines and vast awareness have been spreading, with tweets, updates, videos, and explosive posts. Few studies have been performed on the pandemic to detect and interrelate various disease types, including current coronavirus. However, it is pretty tricky to discriminate and detect a specific category. This work is motivated by the need to inform society about limiting irrelevant information and avoiding spreading negative emotions. In this context, the current work focuses on informative tweet detection in the pandemic to provide relevant information to the government, medical organizations, victims services, etc. This paper used a Majority Voting technique-based Ensemble Deep Learning (MVEDL) model. This MVEDL model is used to identify COVID-19 related (INFORMATIVE) tweets. The state-of-art deep learning models RoBERTa, BERTweet, and CT-BERT are used for best performance with the MVEDL model. The “COVID-19 English labeled tweets” dataset is used for training and testing the MVEDL model. The MVEDL model has shown 91.75 percent accuracy, 91.14 percent F1-score and outperforms the traditional machine learning and deep learning models. We also investigate how to use the MVEDL model for sentiment analysis on 226668 unlabeled COVID-19 tweets and their informative tweets. The application section discussed a comprehensive analysis of both actual and informative tweets. According to our knowledge, this is the first work on COVID-19 sentiment analysis using a deep learning ensemble model.","Malla, SreeJagadeesh P.J.A Alphonse",Applied Soft Computing,,569

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight hundred and twelve medical workers took part in a cross-sectional Internet survey. The questionnaire included a socio-demographic block, a block of questionnaires for assessing the level of symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The data were processed using statistical methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare providers during the pandemic was 48.77% and 57.63% respectively. Subjectively poor quality of sleep was noted by 37.4% of respondents. Cluster analysis distinguished 4 groups of respondents: group 1 was characterized by high scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a low subjective assessment of sleep quality; group 2 had low scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a high subjective assessment of sleep quality; respondents from clusters 3 and 4 had average total scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7, however, group 4 was characterized by significantly lower values of subjective sleep quality assessment. CONCLUSION: The division into clusters makes it possible to understand which groups of medical workers require psychological (psychotherapeutic) support in the first place. Cluster 1 respondents with high levels of anxiety and depression, as well as poor sleep quality, need priority assistance.","Bachilo, E V; Novikov, D E; Efremov, A A",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,,569

402893,Remote Cardiac Safety Monitoring through the Lens of the FDA Biomarker Qualification Evidentiary Criteria Framework: A Case Study Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Substantial progress has been made in reducing the burden of malaria in Africa since 2000, but those gains could be jeopardised if the COVID-19 pandemic affects the availability of key malaria control interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 215·2 (95% uncertainty interval 143·7-311·6) million cases and 386·4 (307·8-497·8) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 224·1 (148·7-326·8) million cases and 487·9 (385·3-634·6) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 233·1 (153·7-342·5) million cases and 597·4 (468·0-784·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 242·3 (158·7-358·8) million cases and 715·2 (556·4-947·9) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25%-75% also increased malaria burden to a total of 230·5 (151·6-343·3) million cases and 411·7 (322·8-545·5) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 232·8 (152·3-345·9) million cases and 415·5 (324·3-549·4) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 234·0 (152·9-348·4) million cases and 417·6 (325·5-553·1) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 240·5 (156·5-358·2) million cases and 520·9 (404·1-691·9) thousand deaths with a 25% reduction; 251·0 (162·2-377·0) million cases and 640·2 (492·0-856·7) thousand deaths with a 50% reduction; and 261·6 (167·7-396·8) million cases and 768·6 (586·1-1038·7) thousand deaths with a 75% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

403264,COVID-19 as a factor influencing air pollution?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, procedural results, and 6-month outcomes of a novel transfemoral transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) system (Cephea) in patients with complex primary mitral regurgitation (MR). BACKGROUND: TMVI is emerging as an alternative to surgery in patients with severe MR. To date, the great majority of TMVI systems use the transapical surgical approach. METHODS: This study included consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TMVI with the Cephea valve system. All patients were suboptimal candidates for catheter-based repair for anatomic reasons. Patients underwent clinical, echocardiographic, and computed tomographic angiographic follow-up at 6 months. Main outcomes were procedural success, peri-procedural complications, and valve hemodynamic status early and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Three patients with severe primary MR (2 women, mean age 79 ± 3 years) at prohibitive surgical risk (mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score 13.8 ± 2.4%) were included. The valves were successfully implanted in all patients, with no procedural complications. Post-procedural echocardiography showed normal valve function in all patients (mean transvalvular gradient 3 mm Hg; range: 2 to 4 mm Hg), no moderate to severe valvular or paravalvular leak, and no clinically significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. At 6 months, all patients had improved quality of life (mean improvement vs. baseline 16.4 ± 12 points). All valve hemodynamic parameters were maintained. Computed tomographic angiography confirmed annular stability, proper valve geometry and no structural failure. CONCLUSIONS: The transfemoral delivery of a purposely designed mitral prosthesis (Cephea valve) was safe and feasible in prohibitive risk patients. Valve performance was sustained, and clinical outcomes improved at 6 months. Larger clinical studies are required.","Alperi, Alberto; Dagenais, François; Del Val, David; Bernier, Mathieu; Vahl, Torsten P; Khalique, Omar K; Modine, Thomas; Granada, Juan F; Rodés-Cabau, Josep",JACC cardiovasc. interv,,569

405550,Covid-19 and the Governance of International Organizations,2020,"The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has created an unprecedented global health problem, resulting in more than 250,000 confirmed deaths. The disease produced by this virus, called Covid-19, presents with variable clinical manifestations, from practically asymptomatic patients with catarrhal processes to severe pneumonias that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In recent weeks, papers have been published describing coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications in these patients, mainly among those admitted to intensive care units. The infection triggers an immune response, which causes different inflammatory mediators to be released into the blood. These include cytokines, which interact with platelets and different coagulation proteins, and promote thrombogenesis. One of the most widely studied coagulation markers in Covid-19 is D-dimer (DD), raised levels of which have prognostic implications, although the best cut-off point for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this population has not been clarified, nor has its usefulness in determining the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required in these patients. Until sufficiently robust information (preferably from well-designed clinical trials) is available, the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines for the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTE should be followed in Covid-19 patients.","López-Reyes, Raquel; Oscullo, Grace; Jiménez, David; Cano, Irene; García-Ortega, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

406649,Modeling the effect of exposure notification and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission in Washington state,2021,"IMPORTANCE: Many ventilated COVID-19 patients require prolonged ventilation. We do not know if tracheostomy will improve their care. Given the paucity of data on this topic, the optimal surgical approach has yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal surgical strategy for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cohort study of 143 ventilator dependent COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy at an academic medical center from April 15 to May 15, 2020, with follow up until June 1, 2020. SETTING: A New York City (NYC) academic quaternary referral center during its peak of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to a NYC medical center with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation for greater than 2 weeks who were unable to be extubated and determined to have reasonable chance of recovery and fit defined tracheostomy candidate criteria. EXPOSURE: Patients had either a percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) or open surgical tracheostomy (ST) performed by one of three surgical services. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and results of tracheostomy for both patients with COVID-19 and the surgeons performing the tracheostomy. Specifically, tracheostomy complications, inpatient mortality, disposition of patients, and transmission of COVID-19 to surgeons were measured. RESULTS: 143 patients underwent tracheostomy, 58 (41%) via a ST, and 85 (59%) via a PT. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups, except that more patients who had a history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) underwent PT (11% vs 2%, p=0.049). There were no statistical differences observed between the PT and ST groups with regard to bleeding complications (3.5% vs 10.3%, p=0.099), tracheostomy related complications (5.9% vs 8.6%, p=0.528), inpatient death (12% vs 5%, p=0.178), discharge from hospital (39% vs 36%,p=0.751) or surgeon illness (0% v 0%, p=1). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The rapid formation of a multi-disciplinary team allows for the efficient evaluation and performance of a large volume of tracheostomies in a resource-limited setting. Bedside tracheostomy in COVID-19 does not cause additional harm to patients if performed after 2 weeks from intubation. It also appears to be safe for proceduralists to perform in this timeframe. The manner of tracheostomy does not change outcomes significantly if it is performed safely and efficiently.","Krishnamoorthy, Subhash; Polanco, Antonio; Coleman, Natasha; Prigoff, Jake; Sturm, Joshua; Blitzer, David; Erwin, Clinton; D039,; Ovidio, Frank; Lemaitre, Philippe; Troob, Scott; Hills, Susannah; Stanifer, Bryan Payne",Ann. surg,,569

Stories of suffering of adults who underwent early surgical intervention for DSD have led many health organizations to call for deferral of unnecessary procedures. While some have instituted full deferral of cosmetic procedures, standard of care remains an interdisciplinary team approach informed by parents' wishes. As the medical community hesitates to institute full deferral, citing absence of long-term data, legislation restricting early procedures is mounting. This article highlights recent data from the DSD-LIFE Study and considers whether and to what extent they support deferral.","Mulkey, Nat; Streed, Carl G; Chubak, Barbara M",AMA J Ethics,,569

Challenges on the road to a post-growth future,2020,"The impact of online social media on societal events and institutions is profound; and with the rapid increases in user uptake, we are just starting to understand its ramifications. Social scientists and practitioners who model online discourse as a proxy for real-world behavior, often curate large social media datasets. A lack of available tooling aimed at non-data science experts frequently leaves this data (and the insights it holds) underutilized. Here, we propose birdspotter -- a tool to analyze and label Twitter users --, and birdspotter.ml -- an exploratory visualizer for the computed metrics. birdspotter provides an end-to-end analysis pipeline, from the processing of pre-collected Twitter data, to general-purpose labeling of users, and estimating their social influence, within a few lines of code. The package features tutorials and detailed documentation. We also illustrate how to train birdspotter into a fully-fledged bot detector that achieves better than state-of-the-art performances without making any Twitter API online calls, and we showcase its usage in an exploratory analysis of a topical COVID-19 dataset.","Ram, Rohit; Kong, Quyu; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02370v1.pdf,569

Questions And Tips For 11-18-Year-Olds To Make It Better],2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major threat to the health and prosperity of human life at present. It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes. Therefore, the question arises, ""Does COVID-19 infection alter the salivary components and composition leading to early transient symptoms of Ageusia and hypogeusia?"" This review shows association of the COVID-19 and Ageusia, in addition to the early viral infection of salivary glands and possible changes in salivary flow and content. Therefore, suggesting a potential association between early ageusia in COVID-19 infection and salivary compositional changes.","Abduljabbar, Tariq; Alhamdan, Rana S; Al Deeb, Modhi; AlAali, Khulud A; Vohra, Fahim",European journal of dentistry,,569

It has put an unprecedented burden on healthcare system globally, and neither obstetricians nor labour rooms are spared as deliveries and caesarean sections cannot be postponed. There is a threat of collapse of healthcare system in maternity wards and labour rooms due to risk for transmission to healthy patients, obstetricians, midwives and other staff. It is not possible to screen all pregnant women especially in developing countries but due to asymptomatic cases, risk of infection looms large. Many countries including India have declared lockdown to stop the transmission but delivery services have to continue. Proper planning and division of the healthcare system into COVID-positive and negative areas with separate staff can help minimise the spread and preserve precious resources.

These changes, often referred to as anomalies, represent significant deviations from an individual's baseline, may be useful in informing the risk of relapse in serious mental illness. Our investigation of smartphone-based anomaly detection resulted in 89% sensitivity and 75% specificity for predicting relapse in schizophrenia. These results demonstrate the potential of longitudinal collection of real-time behavior and symptomatology via smartphones and the clinical utility of individualized analysis. Future studies are necessary to explore how specificity can be improved, just-in-time adaptive interventions utilized, and clinical integration achieved.","Henson, Philip; D039,; Mello, Ryan; Vaidyam, Aditya; Keshavan, Matcheri; Torous, John",Transl Psychiatry,,569

411324,Critical conversations: being Yellow women in the time of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the Swedish government imposed few travel and mobility restrictions. This contrasted with its Scandinavian neighbours which implemented stringent restrictions. The influence these different approaches had on mobility, and thus on COVID-19 mortality was investigated. METHODS: Datasets indicating restriction severity and community mobility were examined; Google's 'Community Movement Reports' (CMR) show activity at key location categories; the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collates legislative restrictions into a 'Stringency Index' (SI). RESULTS: CMR mobility categories were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The strongest correlations were obtained by negatively time lagging mortality data, suggesting restrictions had a delayed influence. During the 'first wave' a model using SI (AIC 632.87) proved favorable to one using contemporaneous CMR data and SI (AIC 1193.84), or lagged CMR data and SI (AIC 642.35). Validation using 'second wave' data confirmed this; the model using SI solely again being optimal (RMSE: 0.2486 vs. 0.522 and 104.62). Cross-country differences were apparent in all models; Swedish data, independent of SI and CMR, proved significant throughout. There was a significant association for Sweden and the death number across models.

Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill.The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We developed Hopewell Hospitalist, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of Hopewell Hospitalist for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing Hopewell Hospitalist for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Dartmouth's Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects has approved the study protocol, which is registered on clinicaltrials.gov. We will disseminate the results through manuscripts and the trials website. Hopewell Hospitalist will be made available on the iOS Application Store for download, free of cost, at the conclusion of the trial.

The aim of this study was to describe risk for OASI in adolescent mothers compared to adults. We further attempted to compare risk factors for OASI between these two age groups. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study between 2003 and 2019. Primiparous women who delivered vaginally, 21 years and younger were compared to women ages 26-35. Excluded were preterm, multifetal, non-vertex, cesarean deliveries as well as intrauterine fetal death. Rate of OASI as well as obstetric and labor characteristics of women with OASI, were compared between groups. Finally, risk factors were assessed for each group separately. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model were performed. RESULTS: Final analysis was performed on 5113 nulliparous adolescents and 13,845 nulliparous in the 26-35 age group. Allocation to study groups was according to OASI - Sixty-seven adolescents (1.3%) had a 3rd or 4th degree perineal tear and were defined as the OASI group, while 5046 patients (98.7%) did not have such a tear. In the adult group, 199 out of 13,845 patients (1.4%) were diagnosed with OASI. Occurrence of OASI did not differ between groups (p = 0.510). Comparison of women with OASI in the adolescent group vs. adult group found differences with regard to operative vaginal delivery, (20.9% vs. 36.2%, respectively; p = 0.023) and meconium stained amniotic fluid (9.1% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.027). Following multivariate analysis the only parameter independently associated with OASI in the adolescent age group was head circumference &#8805; 90th percentile with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.08 (CI 1.48-6.38, p = 0.003). In the adult group the similar analysis revealed operative vaginal delivery (OR = 2.44, CI 1.72-3.47, p < 0.001) and a birthweight&#8805;90th percentile (OR = 2.23, CI 1.19-4.18, p = 0.012) to be independent risk factors for OASI. CONCLUSION: Adolescents have similar risk for OASI compared to adults but differ in risk factors leading to OASI. Head circumference &#8805; 90th percentile was found to be associated with OASI in this age group.","Chill, Henry H; Lipschuetz, Michal; Atias, Eyal; Shimonovitz, Tzvika; Shveiky, David; Karavani, Gilad",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,569

METHODS: A quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey was used among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (N = 250; 85% women; > 50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). RESULTS: COVID-19 was perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression, and 68.4% reported moderate/severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (P = 0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (P = 0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (P = 0.0154) and distress (P = 0.0330) were more likely to report a decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4 to 19 times more likely to report that COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19's impact on research experiences: transition, remote intervention delivery, ability to adhere to program goals, and research participation interest. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that participants engaged in health-related research perceive COVID-19 as a significant threat, affecting mental health, desire to participate in research, and ability to adhere to intervention recommendations.","Cardel, Michelle I; Manasse, Stephanie; Krukowski, Rebecca A; Ross, Kathryn; Shakour, Rebecca; Miller, Darci R; Lemas, Dominick J; Hong, Young-Rock",Obesity (Silver Spring),,569

Between 2005 and 2018, the World Health Organization conducted a series of surveys, in which 88 percent of responding member states confirmed that their biggest challenge in traditional medicine was the need for technical guidance on research and evaluation. As a first step in pursuing this need, our commentary summarizes thirteen international and regional guidance documents by three broad categories on evaluating safety, efficacy, and product quality for market-based approval and distribution of these treatments. We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on these subjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All available guidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conduct of such evaluations. Evidence suggests that improved evaluation methods on efficacy and effectiveness are crucial toward expanding future research into establishing the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, in the context of shifting acceptance, interest, and integration of traditional medicines into health systems, and as another step toward Universal Health Coverage.","Lin, Lydia Wenxin; Ananthakrishnan, Aparna; Teerawattananon, Yot",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,,569
414990,Characterizing COVID-19 misinformation communities using a novel twitter dataset,2020,"BACKGROUND: Frail patients are increasingly vulnerable to stress, which is mainly manifested by a reduced physiologic reserve in metabolic and immune systems and neuromuscular system. Several studies found a significant association of frailty with COVID-19 severity to support the evidence for the application of frailty assessment. However, there were contradictory results in other studies. Thus we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. DESIGN: A systematic review and Meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic retrieving for potential literature was conducted in several public electronic databases, including Medline(OvidSP), EMBASE, Pubmed and Chinese databases(China National Knowledge Infrastructure,Wanfang and Weipu) on August 1, 2020.The literature research was updated on October 26, 2020. Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used for quality assessment. RevMan (Version 5.3) and Stata 14.0 were used to synthesize the pooled effects. RESULTS: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, sixteen studies of 4324 patients were included in the final analysis. Frailty was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19, with pooled adjusted odds ratios of 1.81 (95% confidence intervals:1.48,2.21, I2=87.0%, P<0.001). The result was consistent in stratified analysis to according to age, patient source, definitions of frailty, study quality, and adjustment method. Frailty was significant associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found frailty was significantly associated with an increased risk of clinical adverse events (all- cause mortality, COVID-19 severity, admission to the intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay). Given the epidemic of COVID-19 and shortage of medical resources, paying more attention to screening frailty would contribute to disease management and resource allocation among patients with COVID-19.","Yang, Y; Luo, K; Jiang, Y; Yu, Q; Huang, X; Wang, J; Liu, N; Huang, P",J Nutr Health Aging,,569
415269,Die Pandemiekatastrophe aus katastrophenrechtlicher und -medizinischer Sicht./ [Pandemic Disaster from a Legal and Medical Point of View],2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state-level governments across the United States issued mandatory stay-at-home orders around the end of March 2020. Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This study's purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime - as measured by calls for service to law enforcement - has decreased markedly. However, there are multiple indications that the crime drop is being driven by decreases in minor offenses which are typically committed in peer groups. At the same time, serious crimes which are generally not committed with co-offenders (namely homicide and intimate partner violence) have either remained constant or increased. As such, the crime drop appears to be hiding a very disturbing trend where homicides remain unchanged and intimate partner batteries are increasing. Since many offenders would presumably be committing less serious crimes in a non-pandemic world, we raise attention to the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have taken minor offenders and placed them into situations where there is rampant opportunity for intimate partner violence, serious batteries, and homicides. While crime in the U.S. appears to be down overall, this good news should not blind us to a troubling co-occurring reality - a reality that paints a dim picture of unintended consequences to public health and criminal justice finances as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns.","Boman, John H; Gallupe, Owen",Am J Crim Justice,,569

417876,Urban mobility and public transport: future perspectives and review,2020,"BACKGROUND: To prevent the viral transmission from higher infected to lower infected area, controlling the vehicular traffic, consequently public movement on roads is crucial. Containment strategies and local cognition regarding pandemic might be helpful to control vehicular movement. This study aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of containment strategies and local cognition for controlling traffic volume during COVID-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHOD: Six containment strategies were considered to explore their influence on traffic condition, including declaration of general holiday, closure of educational institution, deployment of force, restriction on religious gathering, closure of commercial activities, and closure of garments factories. Newspaper coverage and public concern about COVID-19 were considered as local cognition in this research. The month of Ramadan as a potential event was also taken into account considering it might have an impact on the overall situation. Average daily journey speed (ADJS) was calculated from real-time traffic data of Google Map to understand the vehicular traffic scenario of Dhaka. A multiple linear regression method was developed to comprehend the findings. RESULTS: The results showed that among the containment strategies, declaration of general holiday and closure of educational institutions could increase the ADJS significantly, thereby referring to less traffic movement. Besides, local cognition could not significantly affect the traffic condition, although the month of Ramadan could increase the ADJS significantly. CONCLUSION: It is expected that these findings would provide new insights into decision-making and help to take appropriate strategies to tackle the future pandemic situation.","Zafri, Niaz Mahmud; Afroj, Sadia; Ali, Mohammad Ashraf; Hasan, Md Musleh Uddin; Rahman, Md Hamidur",PLoS One,,569

Considering the Status in EU Law of Lockdown Measures Which Affect Free Movement (preprint),2020,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global public health crisis. As of 7 January 2021, 87,640,402 confirmed cases and 1,891,692 mortalities have been reported worldwide. Studies focusing on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have suggested a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphopenia and cytokine storm in these patients. The exaggerated immune response induced by the cytokine storm causes septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and/or multiple organs failure, which increases the fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we review the recent research progress on epidemiology, clinical features, and system pathology in COVID-19. Moreover, we summarized the recent therapeutic strategies, which are either approved, under clinical trial, and/or under investigation by the local or global health authorities. We assume that treatments should focus on the use of antiviral drugs in combination with immunomodulators as well as treatment of the underlying comorbidities.","Jamal, Muhammad; Bangash, Hina Iqbal; Habiba, Maria; Lei, Yufei; Xie, Tian; Sun, Jiaxing; Wei, Zimeng; Hong, Zixi; Shao, Liang; Zhang, Qiuping",Virulence,,569
419196,Closed monitoring of Malaysia COVID-19 using SEIR compartmental model for first wave trajectory,2021,"Background: Due to the ban on classroom teaching during the pandemic, the Munich ""Anamnesegruppen"" had to be switched to e-learning at short notice. There were no established concepts for this, which is why digitalization was piloted and evaluated for feasibility. Student ""Anamnesegruppen"": ""Anamnesegruppen"" have existed for over 50 years and are organized as independent student peer teaching. In small groups of medical and psychology students, interviews with patients are conducted once a week during the semester. This is followed by a feedback and discussion round, in which ethical and professional questions are discussed in addition to the patient's medical history. The goal is to train the participants' ability to communicate and reflect. Adaptation to digital methods: The anamnesis seminars have been moved to a virtual group room using video conference. Patients were mainly recruited from the participants' circle of acquaintances. The group size was set at eight people each in four groups and supervised by a pair of student tutors. Confidentiality and data protection declarations were obtained in writing. Results: By switching to digital anamnesis groups, all four groups were successfully completed. Both the final supervision of the tutors and the electronic evaluation of the participants yielded positive feedback. Compared to the two previous evaluations of the semesters in classroom sessions, there were no significant differences in the evaluation. Discussion: The continuously good evaluation results, which did not differ between the digital format and the classroom course of the previous semesters, show that an ad hoc conversion to digital teaching is possible. We want to stress the fact that elements reflecting the doctor-patient relationship were successfully preserved. For the similarly structured Balint groups, virtual sessions may also be considered. Further research, especially prospective, is desirable in order to better understand the possibilities of digital teaching in this area.","Kunisch, Raphael; Zimmermann, Peter; Berges, Natalie; Nitzschke, Malte; Schweiger, Felix; Seidl, Mira; Weidenbusch, Marc",GMS J Med Educ,,569

The reduction in transplantation volume during this time is partly due to concerns over potentially increased susceptibility and worsened outcomes of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed recipients. The consequences of COVID-19 on patients waitlisted for kidney transplantation, however, have not previously been characterized. We studied 56 waitlisted patients and 80 kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 13 and May 20, 2020. Despite similar demographics and burden of comorbidities between waitlisted and transplant patients, waitlisted patients were more likely to require hospitalization (82% vs. 65%, P = .03) and were at a higher risk of mortality (34% vs. 16%, P = .02). Intubation was required in one third of hospitalized patients in each group, and portended a very poor prognosis. The vast majority of patients who died were male (84% waitlist, 100% transplant). Multivariate analysis demonstrated waitlist status, age, and male sex were independently associated with mortality. COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on waitlisted patients, decreasing their opportunities for transplantation and posing significant mortality risk. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on waitlist patients in comparison to transplant recipients may aid centers in weighing the risks and benefits of transplantation in the setting of ongoing COVID-19.","Craig-Schapiro, Rebecca; Salinas, Thalia; Lubetzky, Michelle; Abel, Brittany T; Sultan, Samuel; Lee, John R; Kapur, Sandip; Aull, Meredith J; Dadhania, Darshana M",Am. j. transplant,,569

We analyzed the frequency of virus detection, virus load, and duration of the virus excretion in upper and lower respiratory specimens as well as stool and plasma. We found that the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the virus load, and duration of virus excretion was higher in lower respiratory tract (LRT) than in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens. The duration of virus excretion was longer in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In conclusion, LRT specimens are the most appropriate specimen type for the detection and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

421917,The Reliability of Prediction Factors for the World Stock Markets (preprint),2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Healthcare workers (HCWs) constitute a population which is significantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide. In Mexico, the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER) is the principal national reference of respiratory diseases. Aim: To evaluate the efficiency of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-healthcare workers (INER-HCW). Methods: Currently, the INER has 250 beds and 200 respiratory ventilators to support COVID-19 patients in critical condition. On March 1st, 2020, the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program was launched to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-HCW. Findings: From March 1st to October 1st, 2020, 71.5% of INER-HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 77% of them were frontline workers. Among the tested INER-HCWs, 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, nosocomial infection represented only 3.8% of the cases and the mortality was null. Fifty-three of INER-HCWs positive to SARS-CoV-2 had a negative test 42-56 days post-diagnosis and were returned to service. Finally, although a change in the PPE implemented on May 11th, 2020, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not affected. Conclusion: INER has a lower incidence of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the mean of the national report. The implementation of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program is efficient to decrease the risk of infection among the HCWs. Our findings suggest that the implementation of a similar program at a national level can be helpful to provide a safe environment to HCWs and to prevent the collapse of health institutions.","Salazar, M.

A multicenter ambispective analysis was performed in nine centers in Spain during a 4-month period. Data were collected from every patient, including changes in treatments, referrals or delays in surgeries, changes in surgical approaches, postoperative outcomes and perioperative SARS-CoV-2 status. The hospital's response to the outbreak and available resources were categorized, and outcomes were divided into periods based on the timeline of the pandemic. A total of 301 patients were included by the study centers and 259 (86%) underwent surgery. Five hospitals went into phase III during the peak of incidence period, one remained in phase II and three in phase I. More than 60% of patients suffered some form of change: 48% referrals, 39% delays, 4% of rectal cancer patients had a prolonged interval to surgery and 5% underwent neoadjuvant treatment. At the time of study closure, 3% did not undergo surgery. More than 85% of the patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 9 patients (3%) developed postoperative pneumonia, three of them had confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The observed surgical complications and mortality rates were similar as expected in a usual situation.

Older Adults (OA) are vulnerable to this infection, and may also present delirium, which may be the result of the virus directly affecting the CNS or of systemic inflammation during infection. Objective To determine the clinical characteristics, risk factors, pathophysiology, treatment measures, and prevention of delirium associated with COVID-19 from a review of the literature in times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Method A search was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, UpToDate, and Medscape using keywords in English and Spanish. Results Seventy-two articles were reviewed. We analyzed inclusion and exclusion criteria and 43 articles with relevant information for the narrative description of the review were selected. Twenty to thirty per cent of the COVID-19 patients will present or develop delirium, or changes in mental status during their hospitalization, with rates of 60% to 70% in severe illness. The exact mechanisms are likely to be multifactorial. There is a worrying lack of attention to the implications of identifying and managing delirium in the response to this pandemic. Discussion and conclusion Delirium is a frequent neurological manifestation in OA with COVID-19 and requires early identification, as well as the implementation of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment strategies, which may reduce the associated morbidity and mortality in this age group.","Aguilar-Navarro, Sara Gloria; Duarte-Flores, José Octavio; Granados-Valdéz, Mary Cruz; Suing-Ortega, María José; Mimenza-Alvarado, Alberto José",Salud ment,,569

However, comparing our forecast GDP without COVID-19 (23.2 trillion yuan) with the real GDP (20.65 trillion yuan), there is a smaller drop of 2.55 trillion yuan, a gap of 12.35%. The reason for overestimation is that there are some positive factors including macro-control policies neglected in these models. With the global spread of COVID-19, China should adopt a policy of focusing on both domestic and external affairs against the instability of the world economy. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: Fifteen mongrel dogs, of both sexes, weighing 9.45 ± 2.62 kg, under general anesthesia, were submitted to 34 square shaped skin lesions, with 400 mm² of area, on both right and left thoracodorsal surfaces. After defrosting, Rana catesbeiana skins preserved in a ClNa and glycerol solution at --4ºC were used as biological occlusive dressing on 17 lesion located in the right thoracodorsal region (Test Group). The 17 lesions on the left thoracodorsal side were treated with gauze moistened in a 0.9% ClNa solution (Control Group). The frequency of healed (HW) and non-healed wounds (NHW), and the incidence of frog skin destruction, were analyzed. Five sequences of frog skin samples were histologically examined till tissue destruction started to appear. Inflammatory histological findings were evaluated by percentage of intensity of Polymorphonuclear cells (PPMNC), Mononuclear cells (PMC), and lymphoreticular infiltration (PLI). Two tailed Student's t test and chi square test (chi²) were used as indicated. Results: 1) There was no significant difference in HW and NHW between Groups; 2) There was a 31.00% incidence of frog skin destruction limited to the surface in contact with dog wounds. An increased tendency of destruction was perceived during the studied period; 3) Histological changes of frog skin, characterized by tissue infiltration mainly from mononuclear cells, and by destruction of Malpighi and subjacent layers, were observed at the surface, limited to the wound contact area; 4) PPMNC values attained were not statistically different between groups. In the Test Group PM prevailed and PLI was exclusively seen. Conclusion: Frog skin is ineffective in treatment of canine cutaneous wounds and rejection was suggested as a causative factor.","Cordeiro Falcão, Suyiene; Limongi Lopes, Silvia; Roberto de Barros Coelho, Antônio; Lopes de Almeida, Edvaldo",Acta cir. bras.,,569

We here propose a rapid, simple, and cost-effective amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized with 0.2-0.6 µM primer concentration, 56-60°C annealing temperature, and 3-5 ng/µl complementary DNA to validate on 24 COVID-19-positive samples. Targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with another set of primers.

425979,Food Security Management for Indonesia: The Strategy during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"The spread of COVID-19 is showing huge, unexplained, differences between northern and southern Italy. We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson's coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value < 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson's coefficients between -0.47 and -0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Mutti, Luciano; Pentimalli, Francesca; Baglio, Giovanni; Saladino, Rita Emilena; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Giordano, Antonio",,,569

427324,Who comes first: Rescheduling endoscopic activity after the acute phase of the Covid 19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic infection seems to be a notable feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the prevalence is uncertain. PURPOSE: To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2. STUDY SELECTION: Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365 104) and Spain (n = 61 075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. LIMITATION: For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic. Control strategies for COVID-19 should be altered, taking into account the prevalence and transmission risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed. METHODS: Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel (N = 3,983). ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020. Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019. These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes. RESULTS: The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence. ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020. Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019. While 35-49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020. Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019. LIMITATIONS: No other mental health problems were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: No increase in the prevalence of ADS and lack of ES was found. Some risk factors remained significant after the outbreak, while others changed notably.","van der Velden, Peter G; Contino, Carlo; Das, Marcel; van Loon, Peter; Bosmans, Mark W G",J Affect Disord,,569

Health systems are going to implement telemedical innovations in the near future. Virtual clinical trials (VCT), also known as remote or decentralized ones, may profoundly change the way how clinical studies are conducted, for the benefit of patients with chronic and neurological diseases who are often fragile and may have limited access to traditional healthcare facilities. Despite significant progress, several limitations still need to be addressed to implement telemedicine technologies for VCT. The information and communication technology (ICT) devices (e.g., mobile apps and wearables) may be applied to VCTs but show some practical issues that may hamper the compliance with rigorous research criteria and protocols. We herewith discuss the advantages and disadvantages of virtual reality (VR) in combination with other ICT devices and solutions to improve the conduction of VCT in patients with neurological disorders. The so-called ""digital divide,"" that is, the gap between people who can and those who cannot access high-speed and broadband internet connections, and issues related to VR, such as VR sickness, should be addressed to improve larger VCT participation to neurological patients.","Chiamulera, Cristiano; Mantovani, Elisa; Tamburin, Stefano",,,569

This study has two independent objectives: (1) to report the impact of COVID-19, as well as psycho-social responses during lockdown, in a sample of older adults in Spain, and (2) to explore through the review of published surveys what extent ageism has increased at the population level. The first objective was to search through an online questionnaire collecting information about self-reported health, lifestyles, psycho-social conditions, and a diversity of concerns. This questionnaire was administered to a volunteer sample of 315 older Spanish men and women (301 COVID-19-free and 14 diagnosed with COVID-19). All individuals reported that they had information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Their self-perception of health was also quite good, most maintaining healthy lifestyles and few reporting unhealthy behaviors. They reported few changes in family and interpersonal relations during lockdown. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety, irritation, and fear, in comparison with the COVID-19-free group. Interestingly, instead of being concerned about health, the greatest concern in both groups (COVID-free and those diagnosed with COVID) were politics and the future. Our second objective, to explore ageism during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, was examined across various surveys conducted in several populations by several authors. Results showed an increase in ageism in Spain.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphology and timing of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A provider-facing registry-based study collected cases of cutaneous manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: From December 2020 to February 2021, we recorded 414 cutaneous reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna (83%) and Pfizer (17%). Delayed large local reactions were most common, followed by local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions. Forty-three percent of patients with first-dose reactions experienced second-dose recurrence. Additional less common reactions included pernio/chilblains, cosmetic filler reactions, zoster, herpes simplex flares, and pityriasis rosea-like reactions. LIMITATIONS: Registry analysis does not measure incidence. Morphologic misclassification is possible. CONCLUSIONS: We report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We observed some dermatologic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that mimicked SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, such as pernio/chilblains. Most patients with first-dose reactions did not have a second-dose reaction and serious adverse events did not develop in any of the patients in the registry after the first or second dose. Our data support that cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are generally minor and self-limited, and should not discourage vaccination.","McMahon, Devon E; Amerson, Erin; Rosenbach, Misha; Lipoff, Jules B; Moustafa, Danna; Tyagi, Anisha; Desai, Seemal R; French, Lars E; Lim, Henry W; Thiers, Bruce H; Hruza, George J; Blumenthal, Kimberly G; Fox, Lindy P; Freeman, Esther E",J Am Acad Dermatol,,569

431562,Theoretical perspectives on organizations and organizing in a post-growth era,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a cluster of unknown etiology pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China leading to identification of the responsible pathogen as SARS-coV-2. Since then, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to the entire world. Computed Tomography (CT) is frequently used to assess severity and complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. The purpose of this study is to compare the CT patterns and clinical characteristics in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 218 consecutive patients (136 males; 82 females; mean age 63±15 years) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-coV-2. Patients were categorized in two different groups: (a) ICU patients and (b) non-ICU inpatients. We assessed the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams and recorded the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 patients, 23 (20 males: 3 females; mean age 60 years) required ICU admission, 195 (118 males: 77 females, mean age 64 years) were admitted to a clinical ward. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were predominantly males (60% versus 83% p=0.03), had more comorbidities, a positive CRP (p=0.04) and higher LDH values (p=0.008). ICU patients' chest CT demonstrated higher incidence of consolidation (p=0.03), mixed lesions (p=0.01), bilateral opacities (p<0.01) and overall greater lung involvement by consolidation (p=0.02) and GGO (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CT imaging features of ICU patients affected by COVID-19 are significantly different compared with non-ICU patients. Identification of CT features could assist in a stratification of the disease severity and supportive treatment.","Cau, Riccardo; Falaschi, Zeno; Paschè, Alessio; Danna, Pietro; Arioli, Roberto; Arru, Chiara D; Zagaria, Domenico; Tricca, Stefano; Suri, Jasjit S; Karla, Mannudeep K; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca",,,569

Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic. In order to solve this bioethical problem, we strongly recommend that a randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting be carried out as a matter of urgency in these areas of the world.","Medina, Marco T; Moncada, Sir Salvador",J Neurol Sci,,569

A survey of Covid-19 archives,2020,"A total of more than 27 million confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus outbreak, also known as COVID-19, have been reported as of September 7, 2020. To reduce its transmission, a number of strategies have been proposed. In this study, mathematical models with nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions were formulated and analyzed. The first model was formulated without the inclusion of community awareness. The analysis focused on investigating the mathematical behavior of the model, which can explain how medical masks, medical treatment, and rapid testing can be used to suppress the spread of COVID-19. In the second model, community awareness was taken into account, and all the interventions considered were represented as time-dependent parameters. Using the center-manifold theorem, we showed that both models exhibit forward bifurcation. The infection parameters were obtained by fitting the model to COVID-19 incidence data from three provinces in Indonesia, namely, Jakarta, West Java, and East Java. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most influential parameters on the number of new infections and the basic reproduction number. We found that the use of medical masks has the greatest effect in determining the number of new infections. The optimal control problem from the second model was characterized using the well-known Pontryagin's maximum principle and solved numerically. The results of a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that community awareness plays a crucial role in determining the success of COVID-19 eradication programs.","Aldila, Dipo; Ndii, Meksianis Z; Samiadji, Brenda M",Math Biosci Eng,,569

Besides their fundamental scientific aspects, the findings established in this approach have significant implications in the expansions of target-based therapies and vaccines. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), also known as interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) inducing factor, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The IL-18 binds first to the IL-18&#945; receptor and forms a lower affinity complex. Upon binding with IL-18ß a hetero-trimeric complex with higher affinity is formed that initiates the signal transduction process. The present study, including structural and molecular dynamics simulations, takes a close look at the structural stabilities of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor-bound ligand structures as functions of time. The results help to identify the conformational changes of the ligand due to receptor binding, as well as the structural orders of the apo and holo IL-18 protein complexes.","Roy, Urmi",Comput Biol Chem,,569
434617,Rethinking the political economy of place: Challenges of productivity and inclusion,2021,"Since December 2019, the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications are evolving. As the number of COVID patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is increasing, so is the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema (SE). We report 10 patients of COVID-19, with SE and pneumomediastinum. The mean age of the patients was 59 ± 8 years (range, 23-75). Majority of them were men (80%), and common symptoms were dyspnoea (100%), fever (80%) and cough (80%). None of them had any underlying lung disorder. All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission, with a median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122.5. Eight out of ten patients had spontaneous pneumomediastinum on their initial chest x-ray in the emergency department. The median duration of assisted ventilation before the development of SE was 5.5 days (interquartile range, 5-10 days). The highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 10 cmH2O for patients recieving invasive mechanical ventilation, while 8 cmH2O was the average PEEP in patients who had developed subcutaneous emphysema on non-invasive ventilation. All patients received corticosteroids while six also received tocilizumab, and seven received convalescent plasma therapy, respectively. Seven patients died during their hospital stay. All patients either survivor or non-survivor had prolonged hospital stay with an average of 14 days (range 8-25 days). Our findings suggest that it is lung damage secondary to inflammatory response due to COVID-19 triggered by the use of positive pressure ventilation which resulted in this complication. We conclude that the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and SE whenever present, is associated with poor outcome in critically ill COVID-19 ARDS patients.","Sethi, S M; Ahmed, A S; Hanif, S; Aqeel, M; Zubairi, A B S",Epidemiol Infect,,569

It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2-4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.","Viner, Russell M; Russell, Simon J; Croker, Helen; Packer, Jessica; Ward, Joseph; Stansfield, Claire; Mytton, Oliver; Bonell, Chris; Booy, Robert",Lancet Child Adolesc Health,,569

Despite most paediatric cases being mild in severity, some children require intensive care and mechanical ventilation due to the development of paediatric severe acute respiratory distress. The use of adjuvant therapies in severely ill paediatric patients has not been reported widely in the literature. Prone positioning in spontaneously breathing children has, to our knowledge, not yet been described. In our report, the trachea of a 2-year-old child was intubated, and he was mechanically ventilated for severe bilateral pneumonia. The infant and his mother tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal swabs. Immediately after tracheal extubation, the child developed severe respiratory distress and refractory hypoxia. Awake prone position was employed as a rescue therapy for the management of post-extubation hypoxia, resulting in a dramatic improvement in oxygenation. Prone positioning in the paediatric patient may improve oxygenation and can be a useful adjuvant for respiratory therapy either before, during or after invasive mechanical ventilation. Awake prone position may be considered as an option for the management of COVID-19 in paediatric patients, but it requires patient cooperation.","Alseoudy, M M; Abo Elfetoh, M A; Alrefaey, A K",Anaesth Rep,,569

Method A custom-designed ambulatory voice monitor was used to collect 1 week of pre- and postsurgery data from 27 female patients with PVH; 13 of these patients were also monitored after postsurgical voice therapy. Normative weeklong data were obtained from 27 matched controls. Each week was represented by the DPI, standard deviation of the difference between the first and second harmonic amplitudes (H1-H2). Results Compared to pretreatment, the DPI significantly decreased in the patient group after surgery (Cohen's d effect size = -0.86) and voice therapy (d = -1.06). The patient group DPI only normalized after voice therapy. Conclusions The DPI produced the expected pattern of improved ambulatory voice use across laryngeal surgery and postsurgical voice therapy in a group of patients with PVH. The results were interpreted as providing new objective information about the role of daily voice use in the etiology and pathophysiology of PVH. The DPI is viewed as an estimate of potential vocal fold trauma that relies on combining the long-term distributional characteristics of two parameters representing the magnitude of phonatory forces (neck-surface acceleration magnitude) and vocal fold closure dynamics (H1-H2). Further validation of the DPI is needed to better understand its potential clinical use.","Van Stan, Jarrad H; Mehta, Daryush D; Ortiz, Andrew J; Burns, James A; Marks, Katherine L; Toles, Laura E; Stadelman-Cohen, Tara; Krusemark, Carol; Muise, Jason; Hron, Tiffiny; Zeitels, Steven M; Fox, Annie B; Hillman, Robert E",J Speech Lang Hear Res,,569

METHODS: We analyzed 217 patients (PSA 0-10ng/ml) submitted to transrectal sextant prostate biopsy. Criteria for biopsy indication was PSA >2ng/ml and/or digital rectal exam suspicious of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Fifty five patients had prostate neoplasia (25.3%) and in 8/55 (25.3%) the serum PSA was under 4ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were respectively 98.2% / 16.6% at a cut-off point of 2.5ng/ml and 85.4% / 38.8% at cut-off of 4ng/ml. The corresponding values for prostates >40ml or 40ml were: 96.2% / 8.1% and 100% / 27.2% at the cut-off point of 2.5ng/ml, and 92.5% / 20% and 78.5% / 62.3% at a cut-off level of 4ng/ml. For prostates 40ml a PSA cut-off point of 4ng/ml leads to a misdiagnosis in 21.4% of the malignant tumors. The median PSAD of benign prostates are different according to prostate volume (.40ml or 40ml). PSAD at cut-off of 0.08 increases the PSA specificity at both PSA cut-off points. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate volume affects the sensitivity and specificity of PSA and the median values of PSAD. PSAD of 0.08 increases the PSA specificity specially at a cut-off point of 2.5ng/ml in prostates smaller than 40ml.","Carlos Pereira Martins, Antonio; J.

438972,Technology meets tradition: a hybrid model for implementing digital tools in neuropsychology,2020,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Several measures aimed at containing the spread of this virus have been recommended by international and nation public health institutions, but whether the influenza vaccine, while not protective against COVID-19, nonetheless reduces disease severity is unclear. This study evaluated the potential role of influenza vaccine in reducing the rate of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 cases recorded in the province of Brindisi (Apulia, Southern Italy) during the first pandemic wave (February-May 2020) and occurring in patients vaccinated with the influenza vaccine during the 2019-2020 influenza season were considered. From February 2020 to May 2020, 3872 inhabitants of the province of Brindisi underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and 664 (8.7%) tested positive. A multivariate analysis showed that among COVID-19 patients neither hospitalization nor death was significantly associated with influenza vaccination (p &gt; 0.05), whereas within this group male sex, older age, and chronic diseases were identified as risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Our study did not show an association between the influenza vaccine and complications of COVID-19. Nonetheless, influenza vaccination must be promoted as a central public health measure, because by reducing the burden on hospitals it can greatly benefit the management of COVID-19 patients.","Pedote, P.

439400,"Integrating online and offline data for crisis management: Online geolocalized emotion, policy response, and local mobility during the COVID crisis",2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the medical education platform for students in the United States of America (USA). In that light, medical schools had to rapidly rearrange the dynamics of their educational curricula from the traditional platforms, to incorporate telemedicine. The telemedicine platform is supported in many specialties, allowing students various options to continue their education without interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond. Telemedicine platforms are projected to grow exponentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing a segue for medical schools to modify their curricula by incorporating telemedicine programs. These distant-, e-learning (tele-education) programs align with the recommendations and guidelines for practicing social distancing. In this article, we surveyed fourth-year medical students to better understand their views on multiple aspects of e-learning, and its impact on their medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the medical students' experiences, satisfaction, insight and knowledge with e-learning, tele-education, telehealth, and their related modalities during COVID-19. We provide an organized overview and analysis of the main factors that influence medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic, while bringing forth the main challenges, limitations, and emerging approaches in the field of telemedicine and its application as it relates to medical education and e-learning across medical specialties. We outline the main themes and ideas that the medical students voiced, as to how their medical education is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they will incorporate telemedicine and tele-education in their future career. A cross-sectional, mixed-method survey was developed and distributed via Google Surveys to 181 University at Buffalo, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, United States of America, 4th year medical students, in December 2020. Results were compiled and analyzed after a 6-day open period for responses to be submitted. The survey instrument consisted of questions that inquire about the students' perspectives as it relates to their rapid switch from their traditional method of learning to the on-line version of medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 65 students responded to the survey, of which 63 completed the survey. More than half of the students (n = 63, 57%) indicated that both their specialty of interest, and (n = 21, 33%) their sub-internships were impacted by the temporary lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students also indicated that the top three specialties that were affected included surgery, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. When the students were asked if they were satisfied with the use of aquifer for their health care e-learning, only 35% of the students were satisfied. The students expressed that the school's administration team did a good job in developing the new tele-education curriculum for those in clinical training. In addition, responses indicated that students were open to case-based video learning and readings, when combined with the abbreviated clinical exposure during the make-up ""clinical immersions periods"" allowed for adequate learning. Overall, the survey responses show that more than half, approximately 54% of the medical students utilized telemedicine platforms during their clerkships that were impacted by COVID-19. The 4th-year medical students did not find tele-education and e-learning to be as effective as traditional medical education that combines in-person didactic classroom instructions and in-person face-to-face in hospital clerkships. Students felt that the telemedicine program that was rapidly set up due to the COVID-19 'lockdown' was fragmented, since it was not a formal integration of a telemedicine E-learning program. Students would have preferred more 'real' cases to follow, instead of the ready-made, aquifer type of cases. Telemedicine has significant potential to address many of the challenges facing the medical education environment today. We believe now that people have become comfortable with this method of teaching, that even after the pandemic ends, we will continue to see tele-education used as a platform for medical education.","Franklin, Gillian; Martin, Clare; Ruszaj, Marc; Matin, Maliyat; Kataria, Akaash; Hu, Jinwei; Brickman, Arlen; Elkin, Peter L",,,569

We performed a single center, retrospective case series study of lung transplant recipients, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 February 2020 and 1 March 2021. Clinical, laboratory and radiology findingswere obtained. Treatment regimens and patient outcome data were obtained by reviewing the electronic medical record. Mean age was 49.9 (22–68) years, and twelve (67%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were fever (n = 9, 50%), nausea/vomiting (n = 7, 39%), cough (n = 6, 33%), dyspnea (n = 6, 33%) and fatigue (n = 6, 33%). Headache was reported by five patients (28%). The most notable laboratory findings were elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest was performed in all hospitalized patients (n = 11, 7%), and showed ground-glass opacities (GGO) in 11 patients (100%), of whom nine (82%) had GGO combined with pulmonary consolidations. Six (33%) patients received remdesivir, five (28%) intravenous dexamethasone either alone or in combination with remdesivir, and 15 (83%) were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including co-amoxicillin, tazobactam-piperacillin and meropenem. Four (22%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit, two patients (11%) required invasive mechanical ventilation who could not be successfully extubated and died. Eighty-nine percent of our patients survived COVID-19 and were cured. Two patients with severe COVID-19 did not survive.","Hage, René Steinack Carolin Gautschi Fiorenza Pfister Susan Inci Ilhan Schuurmans Macé M.",Transplantology,,569

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health, sexual function, and quality of life (QoL) in Iranian pregnant and lactating women and compare the results with non-pregnant/non-lactating women. METHOD: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out on pregnant and lactating women, with non-pregnant/non-lactating women from May to Jun 2020. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). One-way ANOVA was used to reveal the statistical differences between the three groups. RESULT: The mean age of patients was 20.81 ± 5.92 years old. The mean (SD) score of HADS in pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant / non-lactating women were 12.11 (6.72), 11.98 (8.44) and 9.38 (6.2) respectively, and the results showed that the scores in pregnant, lactating women were higher than non-pregnant / non-lactating women (P < 0.001). Also the mean (SD) score of QOL and FSFI was 68.29 (9.47), 74.18 (12.65), 79.03 (10.48) and 22.71 (8.16), 22.72 (8.16), 26.19 (3.93) in three groups and the scores in pregnant, lactating women were lower than non-pregnant/non-lactating women (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic increases the risk of depression, anxiety, FSD, and lowers QoL in pregnant and lactating women, with the general population. This suggests the urgent need for psychological intervention in the maternal population during the epidemic.","Mirzaei, Negin; Jahanian Sadatmahalleh, Shahideh; Bahri Khomami, Mahnaz; Moini, Ashraf; Kazemnejad, Anoshirvan",Health Qual Life Outcomes,,569
441423,Tips from the trenches,2021,"With the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over the past few months, the world is facing an unprecedented crisis. Innumerable lives have been lost to this novel infectious disease, the nature of which supersedes conventional medical understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a global health crisis, several aspects of life in the post-COVID-19 era are also being contemplated. Experts in unison are warning that the upcoming changes in all areas of life could potentially be far more drastic than ever experienced in the entire human civilization. The medical community is no exception, and therefore, personnel involved in forensic medicine also need to be adequately prepared for the future. Forensic medicine is a branch of medicine dedicated to one of the most important stages of the human lifecycle and has always been at the forefront in times of unprecedented social change. The autopsy, one of the most important tools of forensic medicine, is also useful to infectious diseases because it identifies the causal relationship between death and infection, reveals medical and epidemiological knowledge, and provides objective evidence for legal disputes. We present new autopsy guidelines in forensic medicine, formulated based on the various infectious diseases that we presently live with and may encounter in the future. In formulation of these guidelines several considerations have been taken into account, namely, the role forensic pathologists should play in the post-COVID-19 era and the necessary preparations as well as the support needed from society to fulfill that role. The present COVID-19 outbreak should be a starting point for formulating improvements in current practices in forensic science, including autopsy biosafety practices and the medicolegal death investigation system.","Kim, Moon Young; Cheong, Harin; Kim, Hyung Seok",J Korean Med Sci,,569
442053,HOTELS' COVID-19 innovation and performance,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which was reported in early January 2020 in China and spread rapidly around the globe, will certainly remain as one of the most impactful disruptive events of the 21st century. To contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine, countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in Istanbul, Turkey, through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. The paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents' self- regulation and governmental measures, distinguishing travel for commute, Social/Recreational/Leisure (SRL), and shopping activities, as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. Due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5â¯m, closure of numerous non-essential venues, encouraging teleworking and distance education, job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in Istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection, the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme, particularly for commuting and SRL trips.","Shakibaei, Shahin; de Jong, Gerard C; Alpkökin, Pelin; Rashidi, Taha H",Sustain Cities Soc,,569
442577,Time-resolved emission reductions for atmospheric chemistry modelling in Europe during the COVID-19 lockdowns,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) involving different primary extranodal sites have distinct clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. However, the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in DLBCL survivors with different primary extranodal sites are unknown. METHODS: A total of 40,714 patients diagnosed with stage I/II DLBCL were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1983 to 2015.The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk (AER) were used to assess the risk of SMNs. RESULTS: The results show that the risk of SMN was significantly higher in extranodal DLBCL than in the US general population (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26), and the risk of developing SMN remains significantly elevated with increased latency. Moreover, there were multiple site-specific risk patterns. There was a 22%, 44%, 66%, 123% and 151% increased risk of SMN 10 years after primary gastrointestinal tract, head/neck, skeletal, lung and liver/pancreas DLBCL diagnosis, respectively. There was a significant decrease risk of SMN with increasing age at diagnosis for primary gastrointestinal tract and skeletal DLBCL. In addition, DLBCL patients with primary sites in the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid and liver/pancreas had the highest incidences of secondary stomach cancer, second thyroid cancer, and second hepatobiliary cancer, respectively, which indicated that the initial site of DLBCL may predict the type of SMN. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies for cancer surveillance after extranodal DLBCL diagnosis may need to be individualized according to the subsite of extranodal DLBCL.","Yin, Xuejiao; Xu, Aoshuang; Huang, Zhenli; Fan, Fengjuan; Wang, Yajun; Chen, Lei; Cui, Guohui; Hu, Yu; Sun, Chunyan",Transl Oncol,,569
442727,How Best Can Finite-Time Social Distancing Reduce Epidemic Final Size?,2020-09-30,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to (1) estimate the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rate and the secondary attack rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Québec, the most affected province of Canada during the first wave; (2) describe the evolution of work-related exposures and infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in infected HCWs; and (3) compare the exposures and practices between acute-care hospitals (ACHs) and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). DESIGN: Survey of cases. PARTICIPANTS: The study included Québec HCWs from private and public institutions with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed between March 1 and June 14, 2020. HCWs aged &#8805;18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Québec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Québec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19. Insufficient pandemic preparedness and suboptimal IPC practices likely contributed to high transmission in both LTCFs and ACHs.","Carazo, Sara; Laliberté, Denis; Villeneuve, Jasmin; Martin, Richard; Deshaies, Pierre; Denis, Geoffroy; Adib, Georges; Tissot, France; Dionne, Marc; De Serres, Gaston",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,569

443692,Imagining a vibrant [post]Qualitative Psychology via ‘Experimentation’,2021,"OBJECTIVE: There was a significant delay in compiling a complete list of the symptoms of COVID-19 during the 2020 outbreak of the disease. When there is little information about the symptoms of a novel disease, interventions to contain the spread of the disease would be suboptimal because people experiencing symptoms that are not yet known to be related to the disease may not limit their social activities. Our goal was to understand whether users' social media postings about the symptoms of novel diseases could be used to develop a complete list of the disease symptoms in a shorter time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Twitter API to download tweets that contained 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', and 'symptom'. After data cleaning, the resulting dataset consisted of over 95,000 unique, English tweets posted between January 17, 2020 and March 15, 2020 that contained references to the symptoms of COVID-19. We analyzed this data using network and time series methods. RESULTS: We found that a complete list of the symptoms of COVID-19 could have been compiled by mid-March 2020, before most states in the U.S. announced a lockdown and about 75 days earlier than the list was completed on CDC's website. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: We conclude that national and international health agencies should use the crowd-sourced intelligence obtained from social media to develop effective symptom surveillance systems in the early stages of pandemics. We propose a high-level framework that facilitates the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information that are posted in various languages and on different social media platforms about the symptoms of novel diseases.","M Zolbanin, Hamed; Hassan Zadeh, Amir; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",Int J Med Inform,,569

443898,Teaching Instrumental Analytical Chemistry in the Framework of COVID-19: Experiences and Outlook,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The specific context related to the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the implementation of distance learning continuity for students. In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation. CONCLUSION: The results obtained largely confirm the data in the literature. The experience gained through this survey should lead teachers to continue their reflection by test/integrating and evaluating distance education systems, while continuing face-to-face activities.","Zorn, Claudine; Feffer, Marie-Laurence; Bauer, Éric; Dillenseger, Jean-Philippe",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),,569

444438,Policy-Aware Data Lakes: A Flexible Approach to Achieve Legal Interoperability for Global Research Collaborations,2020,": The Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center includes programs across the care continuum for people with substance use disorders (SUDs), serving both inpatients and outpatients. These programs had to innovate quickly during the COVID-19 outbreak to maintain access to care. Federal and state regulatory flexibility allowed these programs to initiate treatment for people experiencing homelessness and maximize patient safety through physical distancing practices. Programs switched to telehealth with high levels of acceptability and patient retention. Some programs also maintained some face-to-face clinic visits to see patients with complex problems and to provide injectable medications. Text-messaging proved invaluable with adolescent and young adult clients, and a mobile-health outreach program was initiated to reach mother/child dyads affected by SUDs. A 24-hour hotline was implemented to support seamless access to treatment for hundreds released from incarceration early due to the pandemic. Boston Medical Center also launched the COVID Recuperation Unit to allow patients experiencing homelessness to recover from mild to moderate COVID-19 infection in an environment that took a harm-reduction approach to SUDs and provided rapid initiation of medication treatment. Many of these innovations increased access to treatment and retention of patients during the pandemic. Maintaining the revised regulations would allow flexibility to provide telehealth, extended prescriptions, and remote access to buprenorphine initiation to support and engage more patients with SUDs.","Komaromy, Miriam; Tomanovich, Mary; Taylor, Jessica L; Ruiz-Mercado, Glorimar; Kimmel, Simeon D; Bagley, Sarah M; Saia, Kelley M; Costello, Eileen; Park, Tae Woo; LaBelle, Colleen; Weinstein, Zoe; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,569
445102,Ensuring practical feasibility and sustainability of research work: Need of the hour,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. We aim to quantify vulnerability to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing and mask usage. SETTING: The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. PARTICIPANTS: None (simulation study). RESULTS: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2-3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8-12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30-50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%-18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%-25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%-100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Stuart, Robyn M; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Klein, Dan J; Gray, Richard T; Hellard, Margaret; Scott, Nick",BMJ Open,,569

445536,The Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the air quality in China: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment,2021,"A model-based signal processing framework is proposed for pandemic trend forecasting and control by using non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) at regional and country levels worldwide. The control objective is to prescribe quantifiable NPI strategies at different levels of stringency, which balance between human factors (such as new cases and death rates) and cost of intervention per region/country. Due to the significant differences in infrastructures and priorities of regions and countries, strategists are given the flexibility to weight between different NPIs, and to select the desired balance between the human factor and overall NPI cost. The proposed framework is based on a \textit{finite-horizon optimal control} (FHOC) formulation of the bi-objective problem and the FHOC is numerically solved by using an ad hoc \textit{extended Kalman filtering/smoothing} framework. The algorithm enables strategists to select the desired balance between the human factor and NPI cost with a set of weights and parameters. The parameters of the model, are partially selected by epidemiological facts from COVID-19 studies, and partially trained by using machine learning techniques. The developed algorithm is applied on real global data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker project, which has categorized and quantified the regional responses to the pandemic for more than 300 countries and regions worldwide, since January 2020.

445547,Coronavirus pandemic in Vietnam: an effective response model,2021,"Mitigating the risk of acquiring coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 requires awareness of the survival of virus on high-touch environmental surfaces (HITES) and skin, and frequent use of targeted microbicides with demonstrated efficacy. The data on stability of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and in suspension have been put into perspective, as these inform the need for hygiene. We evaluated the efficacies of formulated microbicidal actives against alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E, murine hepatitis virus-1, or MERS-CoV were deposited on prototypic HITES or spiked into liquid matrices along with organic soil loads. Alcohol-, quaternary ammonium compound-, hydrochloric acid-, organic acid-, p-chloro-m-xylenol-, and sodium hypochlorite-based microbicidal formulations were evaluated per ASTM International and EN standard methodologies. All evaluated formulated microbicides inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in suspension or on prototypic HITES. Virucidal efficacies (&#8805; 3 to &#8805; 6 log10 reduction) were displayed within 30 s to 5 min. The virucidal efficacy of a variety of commercially available formulated microbicides against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses was confirmed.

445548,Coronavirus pandemic in Vietnam: an effective response model,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swept rapidly throughout the world. So far, no therapeutics have yet proven to be effective. Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in China because of its in vitro activity. However, evidence supporting its clinical use with good efficacy is still lacking. METHODS: A total of 208 confirmed severe COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Wuhan Union West Campus between 1 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 were enrolled in the retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the use of ribavirin. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. The secondary endpoints included mortality, survival time, time to throat swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: 68 patients were treated with ribavirin while 140 not. There were no significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics, baseline laboratory test results, treatment, and distribution of ordinal scale scores at enrollment, except for coexisting diseases especially cancer (ribavirin group vs no ribavirin group, P = 0.01). Treatment with ribavirin was not associated with a difference in the time to clinical improvement (P = 0.48, HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.63-1.25). There were also no significant differences between-group in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, mortality, survival time, and the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19, no significant benefit was observed with ribavirin treatment.","Gong, Wei-Jing; Zhou, Tao; Wu, San-Lan; Ye, Jia-Long; Xu, Jia-Qiang; Zeng, Fang; Su, Yu-Yong; Han, Yong; Lv, Yong-Ning; Zhang, Yu; Cai, Xue-Feng",J Infect Chemother,,569
445839,Fighting the (Dis)information pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The therapeutic evidence collected from well-designed studies is needed to help manage the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evaluating the quality of therapeutic data collected during this most recent pandemic is important for improving future clinical research under similar circumstances. OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality and variability in implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treating COVID-19, and to analyze the support that should be provided to improve data collected during an urgent pandemic situation. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP, and the preprint repositories including Social Science Research Network and MedRxiv were systematically searched, up to September 30, 2020, using the keywords ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" ""2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),"" ""novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP),"" ""randomized controlled trial (RCT)"" and ""random."" INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTs studying the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of published RCTs for inclusion and data extraction were each conducted by two researchers. Analysis of general information on COVID-19 RCTs was done using descriptive statistics. Methodological quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias tools in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 5.1.0). Variability in implementation was assessed by comparing consistency between RCT reports and registration information. RESULTS: A total of 5886 COVID-19 RCTs were identified. Eighty-one RCTs were finally included, of which, 45 had registration information. Methodological quality of the RTCs was not optimal due to deficiencies in five main domains: allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Comparisons of consistency between published protocols and registration information showed that the 45 RCTs with registration information had common deviations in seven items: inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, outcomes, research sites of recruitment, interventions, and blinding. CONCLUSION: The methodological quality of COVID-19 RCTs conducted in early to mid 2020 was consistently low and variability in implementation was common. More support for implementing high-quality methodology is needed to obtain the quality of therapeutic evidence needed to provide positive guidance for clinical care. We make an urgent appeal for accelerating the construction of a collaborative sharing platform and preparing multidisciplinary talent and professional teams to conduct excellent clinical research when faced with epidemic diseases of the future. Further, variability in RCT implementation should be clearly reported and interpreted to improve the utility of data resulting from those trials.","Zhao, Meng-Zhu; Zhao, Chen; Tu, Shuang-Shuang; Wei, Xu-Xu; Shang, Hong-Cai",J.

446664,Regional fisheries management: Virtual decision making in a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cucumber plants suffer from a serious threatening disease, downy mildew, throughout the growing seasons irrespective of the weather temperature. The causal agent, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, tends to evolve rapidly upon sequential applications of chemical fungicides and generate new progeny possessing tolerance to such fungicides. Glycoproteins represent an environmentally safe alternative for chemically synthetized fungicides and do not trigger fungicide resistance. We studied the antifungal activity of four glycoproteins namely soybean ß-conglycinin, chickpea vicilin, duck egg ovomucin and catfish p22 against Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Ten commercial fungicides of different chemical groups were used as positive controls of glycoprotein treatments. RESULTS: The results revealed that soybean ß-conglycinin and catfish p22 glycoproteins possess significant antifungal activity against P. cubensis. The amount of disease suppression caused by ß-conglycinin and p22 was comparable to the highly efficient chemical fungicides containing copper oxychloride, cymoxanil and fosetyl Al as active ingredients. Vicilin and ovomucin were less efficient biocides as they gave moderate suppression of disease severity. However, all tested glycoproteins provided full protection for the newly emerged cucumber leaves. Microscopic examination of glycoprotein-treated leaves inferred the ability of catfish p22 and soybean ß-conglycinin to disrupt the integrity of sporangial cell walls of P. cubensis rendering them nonviable comparing to untreated ones. Expression levels of total phenolic compounds and the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were elevated upon glycoproteins application, which infers their involvement in disease suppression. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the direct and indirect roles of glycoproteins in safe management of cucumber downy mildew disease. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with at least two chest CTs and mean 3-month interval between the initial and follow-up CT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were categorized into two groups: complete resolution and residual disease on follow-up CT. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data as well as initial and follow-up chest CT scans were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (57.7%) demonstrate complete resolution of pulmonary findings, and 22 patients (42.3%) had residual disease on follow-up CT. The mean time interval between initial and follow-up CT was 91.3 ± 17.2 and 90.6 ± 14.3 days in the complete resolution and residual groups, respectively. The most common radiologic pattern in residual disease was ground-glass opacities (54.5%), followed by mixed ground-glass and subpleural parenchymal bands (31.8%), and pure parenchymal bands (13.7%). Compared to complete resolution group, patients with residual disease had higher CT severity score on initial exam (10.3 ± 5.4 vs. 7.3 ± 4.6, P value = 0.036), longer duration of hospitalization, higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, more underlying medical conditions, higher initial WBC count, and higher occurrence rate of leukocytosis in the hospitalization time period (all P values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Extensive lung involvement on initial CT, ICU admission, long duration of hospitalization, presence of underlying medical conditions, high initial WBC count, and development of leukocytosis during the course of disease are associated with more prevalence of chronic lung sequela of COVID-19.","Tabatabaei, Seyed Mohammad Hossein; Rajebi, Hamid; Moghaddas, Fahimeh; Ghasemiadl, Mojtaba; Talari, Hamidreza",Emerg Radiol,,569
447307,Lessons Learned from Online Teaching,2021,"The world is entering an era of disaster and chaos due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Since its first emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has swept through Asia and propagated throughout the world to Europe and North America. As of April 13, 1,773,084 people were infected and 111,652 people had died from COVID-19 globally, and new record levels of infection are being reported every day. Based on the data that have been amassed so far, the primary risk factors for a severe disease course or even mortality from COVID-19 are underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. As the global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, patients with endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus and those who are on long-term corticosteroid therapy due to adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism are at risk for a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As endocrinologists, we would like to briefly review the current knowledge about the relationship between COVID-19 and endocrine diseases and to discuss what we can do for the safety and health of our patients with endocrine diseases in this globally threatening situation.","Rhee, Eun Jung; Kim, Jung Hee; Moon, Sun Joon; Lee, Won Young",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),,569

Indonesia, the most diverse country in terms of ape species, has been implicated in the global trade in gibbons, orangutans and, to a lesser degree, chimpanzees. Recently trade has shifted to online platforms, a trend that may have been amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic and partial lockdowns. We assessed the availability of legally protected apes for sale on Facebook and Instagram over two 16-months periods (2017–2018 and 2020–2021). Despite Facebook and Instagram explicitly banning the sale of endangered animals, and Facebook not allowing the sale of live animals, we found 106 gibbons, 17 orangutans and four chimpanzees for sale on five Facebook pages and 19 Instagram accounts. All orangutans and chimpanzees and 70% of the gibbons were infants or juveniles. We did not record any obvious responses of vendors to the Covid-19 pandemic. Facebook and Instagram accounts were linked (similar names, cross-referencing each other and announcing new accounts on existing ones), names were altered (e.g., “petshop” to “pethsop”) and new vendors emerged for short periods. Facebook and Instagram’s policy of not allowing the sale of live and/or endangered wildlife on their platforms is not effectively implemented in Indonesia. © 2021 by the authors.

The disease has become pandemic, affecting almost all nations of the world, and has caused enormous economic, social and psychological burden on countries. Hygiene and educational campaign programmes have been identified to be potent public health interventions that can curtail the spread of the highly infectious disease. In order to verify this claim quantitatively, we propose and analyze a non-linear mathematical model to investigate the effect of healthy sanitation and awareness on the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevalence. Rigorous stability analysis of the model equilibrium points was performed to ascertain the basic reproduction number R 0, a threshold that determines whether or not a disease dies out of the population. Our model assumes that education on the disease transmission and prevention induce behavioral changes in individuals to imbibe good hygiene, thereby reducing the basic reproduction number and disease burden.

450529,Everyday Things Change: Australian Athlete Communication During the Coronavirus Lockdown,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The adherence to public health recommendations to control COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24±3.59) and attitudes (3.72±2.31) and good practices (12.12±1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental health effects.","Masoud, Ahmed Taher; Zaazouee, Mohamed Sayed; Elsayed, Sarah Makram; Ragab, Khaled Mohamed; Kamal, Esraa M; Alnasser, Yusra T; Assar, Ahmed; Nourelden, Anas Z; Istatiah, Loai J; Abd-Elgawad, Mohamed M; Abdelsattar, Ahmed T; Sofy, Ahmed A; Hegazy, Doaa G; Femía, Victor Z; Mendonça, Adriana R; Sayed, Fatma M; Elmoursi, Ahmed; Alareidi, Alaa; Abd-Eltawab, Ahmed K; Abdelmonem, Mohamed; Mohammed, Omar M; Derballa, EzzEldeen A; El-Fas, Kareem A; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M; Abushouk, Abdelrahman I",BMJ Open,,569

451426,Observing Online Courts: Lessons from the Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Non-operative management (NOM) of acute appendicitis has been assessed in several studies before COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review aimed to assess the extent of adoption, efficacy, and safety of NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the literature. Electronic databases and Google Scholar were queried for studies that applied NOM of acute appendicitis during COVID-19. The main outcome measures were the rates of NOM application during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, failure and complication rates of NOM. Failure was defined as the need for appendectomy during NOM and complications included development of appendicular mass or abscess. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (2140 patients) were included. The male to female ratio was 1.44:1 and median age was 34. Nine hundred fifty-nine (44.8%) patients had a trial of NOM. The weighted mean rate of NOM application was 50.1% (95%CI: 29.8-70.5%). The application of NOM during the pandemic was significantly more likely than its application before COVID-19 (OR = 6.7, p < 0.001). The weight mean failure rate of NOM was 16.4% (95%CI: 9.4-23.4). NOM failure was more likely in children and patients with complicated appendicitis. The weighted mean complication rate after NOM was 4.5% (95%CI: 1.4-7.7). NOM had significantly lower odds for complications than appendectomy (OR = 0.36, p = 0.03). There was no mortality after application of NOM. CONCLUSION: NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19 may be a safe, short-term alternative to surgery with acceptably low failure and complication rates.","Emile, Sameh Hany; Hamid, Hytham K S; Khan, Sualeh Muslim; Davis, George N",J. gastrointest. surg,,569

The theory used for analysis is the prospect theory and efficient market hypothesis (EMH). The results of statistical analysis indicate that information about COVID has a negative effect on JCI, as well as trading volume the previous day. The evidence can briefly prove that there is an effect of COVID-19 and weakening daily transactions on JCI. The research findings show that the JCI market uncertainty is in line with the VUCA and Prospect theory. In this case, it occurs that uncertainty affects the behavior of investors' decision making. Investors' decision-making behavior is accumulated in market behavior, and is subsequently manifested in index changes in accordance with the efficient market hypothesis. The contribution of this research to the study of financial market behavior is that uncertainty and uncertainty faced by investors affect market behavior and changes as measured by the index. © 2021 by authors.","Haryanto, A.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is a common complication of ICU patients consisting of symmetric and generalised weakness. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of myopathy, neuropathy or both in ICU patients affected by COVID-19 and whether ICUAW associated with COVID-19 differs from other aetiologies. METHODS: Twelve SARS CoV-2 positive patients referred with the suspicion of critical illness myopathy (CIM) or polyneuropathy (CIP) were included between March and May 2020. Nerve conduction and concentric needle electromyography were performed in all patients while admitted to the hospital. Muscle biopsies were obtained in three patients. RESULTS: Four patients presented signs of a sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy and seven patients showed signs of myopathy. One muscle biopsy showed scattered necrotic and regenerative fibres without inflammatory signs. The other two biopsies showed non-specific myopathic findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have not found any distinctive features in the studies of the ICU patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. SIGNIFICANCE: Further studies are needed to determine whether COVID-19-related CIM/CIP has different features from other aetiologies.

454502,Coronavirus Pandemic Response Fact Sheet: FEMA Administrator Authority to Approve Crisis Counseling,2020,"BACKGROUND: Consistent with fulminant endothelial cell activation, elevated plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen levels have been reported in patients with COVID-19. The multimeric size and function of VWF are normally regulated through A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThrombSpondin Motif type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13)--mediated proteolysis. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the hypothesis that ADAMTS-13 regulation of VWF multimer distribution may be impaired in severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection contributing to the observed microvascular thrombosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n = 23) were recruited from the Beaumont Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Dublin. Plasma VWF antigen, multimer distribution, ADAMTS-13 activity, and known inhibitors thereof were assessed. RESULTS: We observed markedly increased VWF collagen-binding activity in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to controls (median 509.1 versus 94.3 IU/dl). Conversely, plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly reduced (median 68.2 IU/dl). In keeping with an increase in VWF:ADAMTS-13 ratio, abnormalities in VWF multimer distribution were common in patients with COVID-19, with reductions in high molecular weight VWF multimers. Terminal sialylation regulates VWF susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 and other proteases. We observed that both N- and O-linked sialylation were altered in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, plasma levels of the ADAMTS-13 inhibitors interleukin-6, thrombospondin-1, and platelet factor 4 were significantly elevated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with profound quantitative and qualitative increases in plasma VWF levels, and a multifactorial down-regulation in ADAMTS-13 function. Further studies will be required to determine whether therapeutic interventions to correct ADAMTS-13-VWF multimer dysfunction may be useful in COVID-microvascular thrombosis and angiopathy.","Ward, Soracha E; Fogarty, Helen; Karampini, Ellie; Lavin, Michelle; Schneppenheim, Sonja; Dittmer, Rita; Morrin, Hannah; Glavey, Siobhan; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Mallon, Patrick W; Curley, Gerard F; Baker, Ross I; Budde, Ulrich; O039,; Sullivan, Jamie M; Donnell, James S",J Thromb Haemost,,569

456197,Facing Societal Challenges in Living Labs: Towards a Conceptual Framework to Facilitate Transdisciplinary Collaborations,2021,"The year 2020 witnessed an unpredictable pandemic situation due to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks. This condition can be more severe if the patient has comorbidities. Failure of viable treatment for such viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to lack of identification. Thus, modern and productive biotechnology-based tools are being used to manipulate target genes by introducing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Moreover, it has now been used as a tool to inhibit viral replication. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the CRISPR/Cas system can be a viable tool to target both the SARS-CoV-2 genome with specific target RNA sequence and host factors to destroy the SARS-CoV-2 community via inhibition of viral replication and infection. Moreover, comorbidities and COVID-19 escalate the rate of mortality globally, and as a result, we have faced this pandemic. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic manipulation to knockdown viral sequences may be a preventive strategy against such pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) along with CRISPR/Cas13d efficiently degrades the specific RNA sequence to inhibit viral replication. Therefore, we suggest that CRISPR/Cas system with PAC-MAN could be a useful tool to fight against such a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. This is an alternative preventive approach of management against the pandemic to destroy the target sequence of RNA in SARS-CoV-2 by viral inhibition.","Banerjee, Arnab; Mukherjee, Sandip; Maji, Bithin K",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,569

This Policy Analysis addresses that need and is based on a review of relevant ethics literature tightly focused on ethics applicable to public health surveillance. That review revealed that classical health bioethics governing clinical practice and general public health ethics guidance did not adequately address key issues in wastewater surveillance.

457001,Revisiting conduct risk management in the covid-19 era with updated doj criteria,2020,"The SEIRS model, an extension of the SEIR model for analyzing and predicting the spread of virus infection, was further extended to consider the movement of people across regions. In contrast to previous models that con-sider the risk of travelers from/to other regions, we consider two factors. First, we consider the movements of susceptible (S), exposed (E), and recovered (R) individuals who may get infected and infect others in the destination region, as well as infected (I) individuals. Second, people living in a region and moving from other regions are dealt as separate but interacting groups with respect to their states, S, E, R, or I. This enables us to consider the potential influence of movements before individuals become infected, difficult to detect by testing at the time of immigration, on the spread of infection. In this paper, we show the results of the simulation where individuals travel across regions, which means prefectures here, and the government chooses regions to vaccinate with priority. We found a general law that a quantity of vaccines can be used efficiently by maximizing an index value, the conditional entropy Hc, when we distribute vaccines to regions. The efficiency of this strategy, which maximizes Hc, was found to outperform that of vaccinating regions with a larger effective re-generation number. This law also explains the surprising result that travel activities across regional borders may suppress the spread if vaccination is processed at a sufficiently high pace, introducing the concept of social muddling.","Ohsawa, Yukio; Hayashi, Teruaki; Kondo, Sae",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09719v3.pdf,569

457410,Leading through paradox in a COVID-19 world: Human resources comes of age,2021,"It is well understood that the adaptive immune response to infectious agents includes a modulating suppressive component as well as an activating component. We now show that the very early innate response also has an immunosuppressive component. Infected cells upregulate the CD47 ""don't eat me"" signal, which slows the phagocytic uptake of dying and viable cells as well as downstream antigen-presenting cell (APC) functions. A CD47 mimic that acts as an essential virulence factor is encoded by all poxviruses, but CD47 expression on infected cells was found to be upregulated even by pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that encode no mimic. CD47 upregulation was revealed to be a host response induced by the stimulation of both endosomal and cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, including those found in the plasma of hepatitis C patients, upregulated CD47 on uninfected dendritic cells, thereby linking innate modulation with downstream adaptive immune responses. Indeed, results from antibody-mediated CD47 blockade experiments as well as CD47 knockout mice revealed an immunosuppressive role for CD47 during infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Since CD47 blockade operates at the level of pattern recognition receptors rather than at a pathogen or antigen-specific level, these findings identify CD47 as a novel potential immunotherapeutic target for the enhancement of immune responses to a broad range of infectious agents.IMPORTANCE Immune responses to infectious agents are initiated when a pathogen or its components bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR binding sets off a cascade of events that activates immune responses. We now show that, in addition to activating immune responses, PRR signaling also initiates an immunosuppressive response, probably to limit inflammation. The importance of the current findings is that blockade of immunomodulatory signaling, which is mediated by the upregulation of the CD47 molecule, can lead to enhanced immune responses to any pathogen that triggers PRR signaling. Since most or all pathogens trigger PRRs, CD47 blockade could be used to speed up and strengthen both innate and adaptive immune responses when medically indicated. Such immunotherapy could be done without a requirement for knowing the HLA type of the individual, the specific antigens of the pathogen, or, in the case of bacterial infections, the antimicrobial resistance profile.","Tal, Michal Caspi; Torrez Dulgeroff, Laughing Bear; Myers, Lara; Cham, Lamin B; Mayer-Barber, Katrin D; Bohrer, Andrea C; Castro, Ehydel; Yiu, Ying Ying; Lopez Angel, Cesar; Pham, Ed; Carmody, Aaron B; Messer, Ronald J; Gars, Eric; Kortmann, Jens; Markovic, Maxim; Hasenkrug, Michaela; Peterson, Karin E; Winkler, Clayton W; Woods, Tyson A; Hansen, Paige; Galloway, Sarah; Wagh, Dhananjay; Fram, Benjamin J; Nguyen, Thai; Corey, Daniel; Kalluru, Raja Sab; Banaei, Niaz; Rajadas, Jayakumar; Monack, Denise M; Ahmed, Aijaz; Sahoo, Debashis; Davis, Mark M; Glenn, Jeffrey S; Adomati, Tom; Lang, Karl S; Weissman, Irving L; Hasenkrug, Kim J",mBio (Online),,569

459772,E-Business in Pandemic Context - A Systematic Literature Review,2021,"Innate responses provide the first line of defense against viral infections, including the influenza virus at mucosal surfaces. Communication and interaction between different host cells at the early stage of viral infections determine the quality and magnitude of immune responses against the invading virus. The release of membrane-encapsulated extracellular vesicles (EVs), from host cells, is defined as a refined system of cell-to-cell communication. EVs contain a diverse array of biomolecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that the activation of the tracheal cells with different stimuli impacts the cellular and EV miRNA profiles. Chicken tracheal rings were stimulated with polyI:C and LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 or infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H4N6. Subsequently, miRNAs were isolated from chicken tracheal cells or from EVs released from chicken tracheal cells. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in treated groups when compared to the control group. Our results demonstrated that there were 67 up-regulated miRNAs, 157 down-regulated miRNAs across all cellular and EV samples. In the next step, several genes or pathways targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted. Overall, this study presented a global miRNA expression profile in chicken tracheas in response to avian influenza viruses (AIV) and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The results presented predicted the possible roles of some DE miRNAs in the induction of antiviral responses. The DE candidate miRNAs, including miR-146a, miR-146b, miR-205a, miR-205b and miR-449, can be investigated further for functional validation studies and to be used as novel prophylactic and therapeutic targets in tailoring or enhancing antiviral responses against AIV.","O039,; Dowd, Kelsey; Emam, Mehdi; El Khili, Mohamed Reda; Emad, Amin; Ibeagha-Awemu, Eveline M; Gagnon, Carl A; Barjesteh, Neda",,,569

462803,Addressing inequality: The first step beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability,2020,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 8.1 million US residents and killed more than 221â¯000. There is a dearth of research on epidemiology and clinical outcomes in US patients with COVID-19. Objectives: To characterize patients with COVID-19 treated in US hospitals and to examine risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted using Premier Healthcare Database, a large geographically diverse all-payer hospital administrative database including 592 acute care hospitals in the United States. Inpatient and hospital-based outpatient visits with a principal or secondary discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code, U07.1) between April 1 and May 31, 2020, were included. Exposures: Characteristics of patients were reported by inpatient/outpatient and survival status. Risk factors associated with death examined included patient characteristics, acute complications, comorbidities, and medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, total hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, acute complications, and treatment patterns. Results: Overall, 64â¯781 patients with COVID-19 (29â¯479 [45.5%] outpatients; 35â¯302 [54.5%] inpatients) were analyzed. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 46 (33-59) years for outpatients and 65 (52-77) years for inpatients; 31â¯968 (49.3%) were men, 25â¯841 (39.9%) were White US residents, and 14â¯340 (22.1%) were Black US residents. In-hospital mortality was 20.3% among inpatients (7164 patients). A total of 5625 inpatients (15.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 6849 (19.4%) were admitted to the ICU. Median (IQR) inpatient LOS was 6 (3-10) days. Median (IQR) ICU LOS was 5 (2-10) days. Common acute complications among inpatients included acute respiratory failure (19â¯706 [55.8%]), acute kidney failure (11â¯971 [33.9%]), and sepsis (11â¯910 [33.7%]). Older age was the risk factor most strongly associated with death (eg, age &#8805;80 years vs 18-34 years: odds ratio [OR], 16.20; 95% CI, 11.58-22.67; P < .001). Receipt of statins (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56-0.65; P < .001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46-0.60; P < .001), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79; P < .001) was associated with decreased odds of death. Compared with patients with no hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, patients with both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine had increased odds of death (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection in US acute care hospitals, COVID-19 was associated with high ICU admission and in-hospital mortality rates. Use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers were associated with decreased odds of death. Understanding the potential benefits of unproven treatments will require future randomized trials.","Rosenthal, Ning; Cao, Zhun; Gundrum, Jake; Sianis, Jim; Safo, Stella",JAMA Netw Open,,569

466047,Can Education Promote Economic Growth? Developing New Skills and Tackling the Pandemic,2020,"Nutraceuticals need special attention as preventive molecules to create a natural barrier against various dreadful diseases like cancer and to regulate metabolism. In the present study, two spices, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum verum, been identified as excellent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) sources that play significant role in the regulation of cell signal transduction and developmental processes in plants as well as animals, being lucrative and potential targets for pharmacological modulation. PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70°C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Mn2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics. In addition to these properties, the thermostability of PTPases from two spices enhances their significance in industries with therapeutically vital products. Although the source of PTPases is culinary spices, further studies are required to establish the utilization of PTPases as nutraceuticals and in therapeutic formulations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: For a healthy lifestyle, awareness needs to be created by humankind towards food habits to minimize illnesses. Numerous studies have explored the consumption of nutraceutical products acts as a natural barrier and immune booster for various human ailments including SARS-COV-2. PTPases play important roles in regulating intracellular signaling and, ultimately, biological function along with their structural features. The importance of PTPases and their inhibitors has been implicated in various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Further investigations need to be undertaken to explore the therapeutic properties of PTPases in both in vivo and in vitro for their clinical significance.","Selvaraj, Kanagarethinam; Katare, Deepshikha Pande; Chand, Subhash; Chaudhary, Nidhee",J Food Biochem,,569

In this way the frequencies of major outbreaks and pandemics can be reduced. Snowball designs are needed in studies of sexual and opioid networks through which HIV can spread explosively, so that prevention intervention methods can be developed, accurately assessed, and effectively distributed.","Thompson, Steve",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04464v1.pdf,569
471965,Drinking to the Wolf in a Time of Pandemic (or War or Peace),2021,"Calcineurin-B-like proteins (CBLs) are essential components of the calcium signaling network and act during plant's response to stress and normal conditions. A combined research strategy of in-silico analysis and gene silencing experiment was employed to investigate the role of different classes of CBLs in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) during the response to drought stress. Two different classes of CBL genes, including SlCBL3-1, and SlCBL3-2, with the minimum and a maximum number of drought-responsive cis-elements, were selected and were targeted for transient gene silencing in tomato followed by the drought treatment. The effect of silencing events was evaluated by determining of further growth and physiological traits in plants under both control and drought stress conditions. The results showed that silencing of SlCBL3-1 significantly reduced shoot and root growth, relative water content (RWC), and the concentration of pigments while increased free radical accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and leakage from the cells. On the other hand, no antioxidant enzyme activity or proline induction was triggered in plants after SlCBL3-1 silencing. Some of these adverse events were more significantly enhanced when the silenced plants were exposed to drought stress. Overall, a significant role for SlCBL3-1 in the life cycle of plant suggested under both normal and stress conditions. The SlCBL3-2 silencing showed more efficient plants recovery from silencing or drought stress conditions. Therefore, SlCBL3-2 gene may act as a negative regulator under stress conditions. The results might provide new theoretical insight and genetic resources for developing resistant crops against environmental stresses.","Hosseini Tafreshi, Seyed Ali; Aghaie, Peyman; Ebrahimi, Mohammad Ali; Haerinasab, Maryam",Plant Physiol Biochem,,569

Some states, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden and the USA initially focused on keeping the restrictions for economy and society as low as possible. The responsible authorities were of the opinion - and still are e.g. in Sweden - that it is sufficient enough to protect particularly vulnerable persons such as the elderly or people with pre-existing conditions. The idea behind this is that as soon as 60 to 70 percent of the population is infected with a pathogen, a so-called ""herd immunity"" has developed. However, the increasing numbers of deaths and modelling studies showed the expected overload of the hospitals. Therefore, most countries decided for a temporary lockdown with the exception of Sweden.Based on the number of the total population, three times more people died from COVID-19 in Sweden (2679 deaths per 10 million inhabitants) compared to Germany (6848 deaths per 80 million inhabitants). The comparison Sweden versus Taiwan is even worse because 1072 times more people died in Sweden based on the number of the population (6 deaths per 24 million inhabitants).In the face of the lack of an antiviral treatment and the lack of a protective vaccine one must state Taiwan has made the best out of the pandemic situation whereas Sweden failed completely.","Jung, F; Krieger, V; Hufert, F T; Küpper, J-H",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,,569

METHODS: Upon admission to the emergency room, the inflammation-based risk scoring system was applied and patients were classified as having mild, moderate, or severe inflammation. In-hospital occurrence of thrombosis, need for mechanical ventilation, and death were recorded. RESULTS: One-hundred patients (55 ± 13 years; 71% men) were included and classified as having mild (29%), moderate (12%), or severe (59%) inflammation. The need for mechanical ventilation differed among patients in each group (16%, 50%, and 71%, respectively; P < 0.0001), yielding a 4.1-fold increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate inflammation and 5.4 for those with severe inflammation. On the contrary, there were no differences for the occurrence of thrombosis (10%, 8%, and 22%, respectively; P = 0.142) or death (21%, 42%, and 39%, respectively; P = 0.106). In the multivariate analysis, only severe inflammation (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.1), D-dimer > 574 ng/mL (HR = 3.0), and troponin I &#8805; 6.7 ng/mL (HR = 2.4) at hospital admission were independent predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation.

Evolutionary psychology has advanced our understanding of why humans suffer psychological distress and mental illness. However, to date, the evolutionary origins of what drives humans to alleviate the suffering of others has received limited attention. Therefore, we draw upon evolutionary theory to assess why humans psychologically support one another, focusing on the interpersonal regulation of emotions that shapes how humans heal and console one another when in psychosocial distress. To understand why we engage in psychological healing, we review the evolution of cooperation among social species and the roles of emotional contagion, empathy, and self-regulation. We discuss key aspects of human biocultural evolution that have contributed to healing behaviors: symbolic logic including language, complex social networks, and the long period of childhood that necessitates identifying and responding to others in distress. However, both biological and cultural evolution also have led to social context when empathy and consoling are impeded. Ultimately, by understanding the evolutionary processes shaping why humans psychologically do or do not heal one another, we can improve our current approaches in global mental health and uncover new opportunities to improve the treatment of mental illness across cultures and context around the world.","Kohrt, Brandon A; Ottman, Katherine; Panter-Brick, Catherine; Konner, Melvin; Patel, Vikram",Clin Psychol Rev,,569

476543,¿How to face coronavirus pandemic in Ophthalmology?,2020,"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.","Bouman, Judith A; Riou, Julien; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R",PLoS Comput Biol,,569

Many patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome, even are in danger of death. This is the first study to evaluate dynamic changes of D-Dimer and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Count Ratio (NLR) as a prognostic utility in patients with COVID-19 for clinical use. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we collected data from 349 hospitalized patients who diagnosed as the infection of the COVID-19 in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. We used ROC curves and Cox regression analysis to explore critical value (optimal cut-off point associated with Youden index) and prognostic role of dynamic changes of D-Dimer and NLR. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-nine participants were enrolled in this study and the mortality rate of the patients with laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 was 14.9%. The initial and peak value of D-Dimer and NLR in deceased patients were higher statistically compared with survivors (P < 0.001). There was a more significant upward trend of D-Dimer and NLR during hospitalization in the deceased patients, initial D-Dimer and NLR were lower than the peak tests (MD) -25.23, 95% CI: - 31.81- -18.64, P < 0.001; (MD) -43.73, 95% CI:-59.28- -31.17, P < 0.001. The test showed a stronger correlation between hospitalization days, PCT and peak D-Dimer than initial D-Dimer. The areas under the ROC curves of peak D-Dimer and peak NLR tests were higher than the initial tests (0.94(95%CI: 0.90-0.98) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.87); 0.93 (95%CI:0.90-0.96) vs. 0.86 (95%CI:0.82-0.91). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR was 0.73 mg/L, 3.78 mg/L,7.13 and 14.31 respectively. 35 (10.03%) patients were intubated. In the intubated patients, initial and peak D-Dimer and NLR were much higher than non-intubated patients (P < 0.001). The critical value of initial D-Dimer, peak D-Dimer, initial NLR and peak NLR in prognosticate of intubation was 0.73 mg/L, 12.75 mg/L,7.28 and 27.55. The multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, P = 0.01), the peak D-Dimer (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P < 0.001) were prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients' death. CONCLUSIONS: To dynamically observe the ratio of D-Dimer and NLR was more valuable during the prognosis of COVID-19.

The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 widely varies from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammatory disease. It is thought that host genetic variability may affect the host's response to the virus infection and thus cause severity of the disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus requires interaction with its receptor complex in the host cells before infection. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as one of the key molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor binding and cell invasion. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the correlation between a genetic variant within the human TMPRSS2 gene and COVID-19 severity and viral load. RESULTS: We genotyped 95 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in Dr Soetomo General Hospital and Indrapura Field Hospital (Surabaya, Indonesia) for the TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met polymorphism. Polymorphism was detected using a TaqMan assay. We then analysed the association between the presence of the genetic variant and disease severity and viral load. We did not observe any correlation between the presence of TMPRSS2 genetic variant and the severity of the disease. However, we identified a significant association between the p.Val160Met polymorphism and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, as estimated by the Ct value of the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test. Furthermore, we observed a trend of association between the presence of the C allele and the mortality rate in patients with severe COVID-19.

Implementation of these models allows for prediction of short-term morbidity, mortality and survival of patients with an accuracy of 99 % both in the Russian Federation in general and in the regions. In addition, the distribution of CVI was characterized. Particularly, Moscow and Moscow region have the maximum spread of infection, and other regions are lagging behind in the dynamics of the incidence by 1–3 weeks. The obtained models allow us to predict the course of the disease in the regions successfully and take the necessary measures in a timely manner.","Lakman, I. A.; Agapitov, A. A.; Sadikova, L.

477521,"E-learning in business practice, a case study during covid-19 in croatia",2020,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are functional components of the human genome. Recent studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis, and are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in several types of tumor, including lung cancer. However, the clinical relevance of lncRNA expression in lung cancer remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern of RFPL3 antisense (RFPL3S) and its associations with clinicopathological characteristics in patients with lung cancer. Whether RFPL3S can act as a potential prognostic biomarker for lung cancer was also investigated. RFPL3S expression in tumor samples and cells was assessed using the Oncomine database and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, respectively. Based on Kaplan-Meier Plotter analyses, the prognostic values of RFPL3S were further evaluated. It was revealed that RFPL3S was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues when compared with normal tissues and was significantly associated with pN factor, pTNM stage and Ki-67 labeling index. In the survival analyses, increased RFPL3S expression was associated with poor survival and was inversely associated with first progression in all patients. These results indicate that RFPL3S may be of clinical significance and may act as a prognostic biomarker in lung cancer.","Liu, Zhonghua; Ning, Zhiqiang; Lu, Hailin; Cao, Tinghua; Zhou, Feng; Ye, Xia; Chen, Chao",Oncol Lett,,569

477605,Evaluating How Smartphone Contact Tracing Technology Can Reduce the Spread of Infectious Diseases: The Case of COVID-19,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is undeniably the most severe global health emergency since the 1918 Influenza outbreak. Depending on its evolutionary trajectory, the virus is expected to establish itself as an endemic infectious respiratory disease exhibiting seasonal flare-ups. Therefore, despite the unprecedented rally to reach a vaccine that can offer widespread immunization, it is equally important to reach effective prevention and treatment regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Contributing to this effort, we have curated and analyzed multi-source and multi-omics publicly available data from patients, cell lines and databases in order to fuel a multiplex computational drug repurposing approach. We devised a network-based integration of multi-omic data to prioritize the most important genes related to COVID-19 and subsequently re-rank the identified candidate drugs. Our approach resulted in a highly informed integrated drug shortlist by combining structural diversity filtering along with experts' curation and drug-target mapping on the depicted molecular pathways. In addition to the recently proposed drugs that are already generating promising results such as dexamethasone and remdesivir, our list includes inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase (bosutinib, dasatinib, cytarabine and saracatinib), which appear to be involved in multiple COVID-19 pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, we highlight specific immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs like dactolisib and methotrexate and inhibitors of histone deacetylase like hydroquinone and vorinostat with potential beneficial effects in their mechanisms of action. Overall, this multiplex drug repurposing approach, developed and utilized herein specifically for SARS-CoV-2, can offer a rapid mapping and drug prioritization against any pathogen-related disease.","Tomazou, M; Bourdakou, M M; Minadakis, G; Zachariou, M; Oulas, A; Karatzas, E; Loizidou, E; Kakouri, A; Christodoulou, C; Savva, K; Zanti, M; Onisiforou, A; Afxenti, S; Richter, J; Christodoulou, C G; Kyprianou, T; Kolios, G; Dietis, N; Spyrou, G M",Brief. bioinform,,569
477622,The Appointment in Samarra: A New Use for Some Old Jokes,2020,"Poverty, crowded housing, and other community attributes associated with social vulnerability increase a community's risk for adverse health outcomes during and following a public health event (1). CDC uses standard criteria to identify U.S. counties with rapidly increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspot counties) to support health departments in coordinating public health responses (2). County-level data on COVID-19 cases during June 1-July 25, 2020 and from the 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) were analyzed to examine associations between social vulnerability and hotspot detection and to describe incidence after hotspot detection. Areas with greater social vulnerabilities, particularly those related to higher representation of racial and ethnic minority residents (risk ratio [RR] = 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-6.4), density of housing units per structure (RR = 3.1; 95% CI = 2.7-3.6), and crowded housing units (i.e., more persons than rooms) (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.8-2.3), were more likely to become hotspots, especially in less urban areas. Among hotspot counties, those with greater social vulnerability had higher COVID-19 incidence during the 14 days after detection (212-234 cases per 100,000 persons for highest SVI quartile versus 35-131 cases per 100,000 persons for other quartiles). Focused public health action at the federal, state, and local levels is needed not only to prevent communities with greater social vulnerability from becoming hotspots but also to decrease persistently high incidence among hotspot counties that are socially vulnerable.","Dasgupta, Sharoda; Bowen, Virginia B; Leidner, Andrew; Fletcher, Kelly; Musial, Trieste; Rose, Charles; Cha, Amy; Kang, Gloria; Dirlikov, Emilio; Pevzner, Eric; Rose, Dale; Ritchey, Matthew D; Villanueva, Julie; Philip, Celeste; Liburd, Leandris; Oster, Alexandra M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,569

The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors-they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Martina Rojnic; Curkovic, Marko; Wasserman, Danuta",Eur Psychiatry,,569

As COVID-19 alerts us to shift science education to digital when in-person schooling is not viable, one approach to facilitate this shift, as reviewed by Zacharia et al. (2015), is to involve students in computer supported inquiry learning (CoSIL) with appropriate guidance. As CoSIL guidance is critical to student success in CoSIL, Zacharia et al. (2015) contribute to our knowledge by systematically reviewing the forms and the efficacy of such guidance tools that are associated with each phase of scientific inquiry. With such knowledge we may develop decent guidance so that students can experience scientific inquiry virtually as they used to do in-person. Zacharia et al. (2015) indicated that the various guidance tools had increased the ease of use of CoSIL but failed in personalizing CoSIL to individual students. I agree with Zacharia et al. that the personalization of CoSIL guidance is vital. Further, I argue that the emergent machine learning may significantly increase the personalization of CoSIL without burdening teachers. I conclude the essay with suggestions to further investigate the cognitive needs of students in CoSIL and integrate the content, CoSIL, and guidance tools, as a way to move forward the personalization of CoSIL.","Zhai, Xiaoming",Educ Technol Res Dev,,569

479523,Small business in the Arctic: background for changing the management paradigm,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To improve understanding of transition from viral infection to viral clearance, and antibody response in pediatric patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoglobulin G antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13, 2020, and June 21, 2020, included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. RESULTS: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and time from RT-PCR positivity to negativity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 through 15 years demonstrated a longer time of RT-PCR positivity to negativity, compared with patients aged 16 through 22 years (median 32 vs 18 days, P = .015). Median time to seropositivity, by chemiluminescent testing, from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days, whereas median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as comparable with 160 titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing) was 36 days. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. It is unknown whether this correlates with persistent infectivity. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated adequate neutralizing antibodies during the time frame of specimen collection. It remains unknown whether immunoglobulin G antibody against spike structured proteins correlates with immunity, and how long antibodies and potential protection persist.","Bahar, Burak; Jacquot, Cyril; Mo, Yunchuan D; DeBiasi, Roberta L; Campos, Joseph; Delaney, Meghan",J Pediatr,,569

This study aimed to assess anxiety levels during COVID-19 in children with chronic kidney disease(CKD), including nephrotic syndrome(NS) and kidney transplantation(Tx). METHODS: A case-control, cross-sectional study was conducted with children aged of 10 to 18 years, who had been followed with diagnosis of CKD,NS,Tx between April and July 2020. Healthy control group was recruited age and gender-matched children. A questionnaire with printed and online version is designed in three parts: demographic characteristics, opinions about the pandemic, Turkish version of The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale- Child Version (RCADS-CV). RESULTS: Total of 88 children completed the questionnaire. The patient and control groups were similar by gender, age, household members and history of psychiatric treatment. Both groups stated that coronavirus is a risky disease for children(63.6%), they were afraid of contagion(69.3%). Only half of them were receiving realistic and informative answers from family members. In RCADS-CV, 66% of them get high score from at least one subscale. Social Phobia(SP) scores of the control group was higher, although the high-scoring ratios were similar. The ratio of high-scored participants was higher in CKD patients for Panic Disorder, and was lower in immunosuppressive agent group for SP. CONCLUSION: The current COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster that children encounter for the first time in their lives. It does not exclusively cause anxiety among children with chronic kidney diseases, but also healthy children.","Erfidan, Gökçen; Özyurt, Gonca; Arslansoyu-Çamlar, Seçil; Özdemir-Simsek, Özgür; Basaran, Cemaliye; Alaygut, Demet; Mutlubas, Fatma; Kasap-Demir, Belde",Pediatr. int,,569

However, the pandemic has caused collateral damage to those with non-COVID-19 diseases. We aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation of newly diagnosed childhood onset type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted over a one-year period. We compared the severity of presentation of new-onset type 1 diabetes in children under the age of 18 presenting to the multi-centre North Central London diabetes network before (1st July 2019 to 22nd March 2020) and during (23rd March 2020 to 30th June 2020) the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Over the one-year study period, a total of 30 children presented with new-onset type 1 diabetes during the pre-pandemic period and 17 presented during the first COVID-19 wave. Children presented more frequently in DKA during the first COVID-19 wave compared with pre-pandemic (pre-pandemic: mild 13%, moderate 6.7%, severe 10%; first COVID-19 wave: mild 5.9%, moderate 24%, severe 47%; p=0.002). During the first COVID-19 wave, DKA presentations in children with a family history of type 1 diabetes were fewer compared to those without a family history (33.3% vs 100.0%; p=0.006). Children presenting in severe DKA pre-pandemic were younger than those not in severe DKA (3.9 years vs 12.2 years, p<0.001) but this difference was not significant during the first COVID-19 wave (10.1 years vs 11.2 years, p=0.568).

482010,Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM and Dynamic Behavioral Models,2020-05-24,"BACKGROUND: During quarantine, both physical and mental health are a concern. To the same extent that physicians are a scarce resource during this crisis, psychiatrists and psychologists are also limited in number. To help practitioners and public managers decide where to invest their resources, the present research investigated the relationships of stress, depression and state anxiety levels with sociodemographic and behavioural variables. METHODS: Data were collected in Brazil between March, 18 and 22, 2020 in 1,468 volunteers during quarantine. Participants with a history of or current mental health illnesses were excluded leaving 1,460 individuals in the final sample. The online assessment included instruments for psychological stress, depression and state anxiety. A sociodemographic and behavioural questionnaire with 15 items was used to assess other factors. Multiple linear regression was performed for each psychological outcome to determine a hierarchy of significant predictors. FINDINGS: Stress, depression and state anxiety levels were all predicted by gender (women higher than men), quality of nutrition, attendance in tele-psychotherapy, exercise frequency, presence of elderly persons in quarantine with the person, obligation to work outside the home, level of education (more educated, lesser risk for mental illness) and age (younger age, greater risk). Having a perceived risk factor for COVID-19 predicted depression and state anxiety, but not stress. Finally, the presence of children in quarantine with the participant was a protective factor for depression. INTERPRETATION: Even though this research is limited by its cross-sectional design, it is possible to infer that mental health varies by demographic attributes, obligations and health behaviours. Those who report higher distress must work outside the home during quarantine, live with an elderly person and carry a risk factor for COVID-19, among other factors. Identifying those who are most vulnerable would help to prioritize those who may need the greatest psychological aid and assist public health practitioners in developing support strategies.","Filgueiras, Alberto; Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew",Psychol Rep,,569
482078,Can Tracking Data Help in Assessing Interpersonal Contact Exposure in Team Sports during the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that the COVID Stress Scales have a robust multifactorial structure, representing five correlated facets of COVID-19-related distress: (a) Fear of the dangerousness of COVID-19, which includes fear of coming into contact with fomites potentially contaminated with SARSCoV2, (b) worry about socioeconomic costs of COVID-19 (e.g., worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain), (c) xenophobic fears that foreigners are spreading SARSCoV2, (d) traumatic stress symptoms associated with direct or vicarious traumatic exposure to COVID-19 (nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19), and (e) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. RESULTS: Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation. CONCLUSION: The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine whether the syndrome will abate once the pandemic has passed or whether, for some individuals, it becomes a chronic condition.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Paluszek, Michelle M; Fergus, Thomas A; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",Depress Anxiety,,569

In this work, we focus on the hyperechoic B-line segmentation task. Using deep neural networks, we automatically outline the regions that are indicative of pathology-sensitive artifacts and their associated sonographic patterns. With a real-world data-scarce scenario, we investigate approaches to utilize both COVID-19 and CAP lung ultrasound data to train the networks; comparing fine-tuning and unsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at inference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic stages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios. Adapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP patients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p<0.001) and from 0.43 to 0.71 (p<0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases, respectively. It is of practical value that the improvement was demonstrated with only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a common constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice. Interestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP data to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested on either condition. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation that correlates the segmentation performance to label consistency and data domain diversity in this point-of-care lung ultrasound application.","Mason, Harry; Cristoni, Lorenzo; Walden, Andrew; Lazzari, Roberto; Pulimood, Thomas; Grandjean, Louis; Wheeler-Kingshott, Claudia AM Gandini; Hu, Yipeng; Baum, Zachary MC",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03138v1.pdf,569

Whether clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 differ between regions has not yet been studied systematically. Here, we report differences in underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas and in New York state. METHODS: We established a multicenter retrospective registry including patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 15 and July 12, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were manually retrieved from electronic medical records. We focused on the following outcomes: mortality, need for pharmacologic circulatory support, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for hemodialysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients in the Texas cohort (n = 296) were younger (57 vs. 63 years, p value <0.001), they had a higher BMI (30.3 kg/m2 vs. 28.5 kg/m2, p = 0.015), and they had higher rates of diabetes mellitus (41 vs. 30%; p = 0.014). In contrast, patients in the New York state cohort (n = 218) had higher rates of coronary artery disease (19 vs. 10%, p = 0.005) and atrial fibrillation (11 vs. 5%, p = 0.012). Pharmacologic circulatory support, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis were more frequent in the Texas cohort (21 vs. 13%, p = 0.020; 30 vs. 12%, p < 0.001; and 11 vs. 5%, p = 0.009, respectively). In-hospital mortality was similar between the 2 cohorts (16 vs. 18%, p = 0.469). After adjusting for differences in underlying comorbidities, only the use of mechanical ventilation remained significantly higher in the participating Texas hospitals (odds ratios [95% CI]: 3.88 [1.23, 12.24]). Median time to pharmacologic circulatory support was 8 days (interquartile range: 2, 13.8) in the Texas cohort compared to 1 day (0, 3) in the New York state cohort, while median time to in-hospital mortality was 16 days (10, 25.5) and 7 days (4, 14), respectively (both p < 0.001).

However, across the USA, the burden of cardiovascular comorbidities varies significantly. Whether clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 differ between regions has not yet been studied systematically. Here, we report differences in underlying cardiovascular comorbidities and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas and in New York state. METHODS: We established a multicenter retrospective registry including patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 15 and July 12, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were manually retrieved from electronic medical records. We focused on the following outcomes: mortality, need for pharmacologic circulatory support, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for hemodialysis.

This paper investigated this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. All the admitted cases from 1 January to 30 June 2020 were considered. Poisson regression models were used to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission rates can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1394 stroke patients took admission in the stroke unit during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger. The male to female ratio is 1.06:1. From January to March 2020, the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month, which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June, with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done, whereas, in the last three months, there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT-PCR SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement or stay-home measures remains unknown.","Hasan, A T M Hasibul; Das, Subir Chandra; Islam, Muhammad Sougatul; Mansur, Mohaimen; Shawon, Md Shajedur Rahman; Hassan, Rashedul; Chowdhury, Mohammad Shah Jahirul Hoque; Mondal, Md Badrul Alam; Mohammad, Quazi Deen",PLoS One,,569
483305,A New Normal: The Changed Landscape of Human Resource Development in the Wake of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Although women comprise 33% of the HIV-1-carriers in Israel, they have not previously been considered a risk group requiring special attention. Immigration waves from countries in Africa and in East Europe may have changed the local landscape of women diagnosed with HIV-1. Here, we aimed to assess viral and demographic characteristics of HIV-1-positive women identified in Israel between 2010 and 2018. METHODS: All > 16 year-old, HIV-1-infected women, diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018, (n = 763) registered in the National HIV reference laboratory were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the database. Viral subtypes and transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) were determined in 337 (44.2%) randomly selected samples collected from treatment-naive women. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 38 years. Most (73.3%) women were immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) (41.2%, 314) or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (32.2%, 246) and carried subtype A (79.7%) or C (90.3%), respectively. Only 11.4% (87) were Israeli-born women. Over the years, the prevalence of women from SSA decreased while that of women from FSU increased significantly (p < 0.001). The median CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm3, and higher (391 cells/mm3) in Israeli-born women. TDRM were identified in 10.4% of the tested samples; 1.8, 3 and 7.1% had protease inhibitors (PI), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) TDRM, respectively. The prevalence of women with NNRTI TDRM significantly increased from 4.9% in 2010-2012 to 13.3% in 2016-2018. Israeli-born women had the highest prevalence (16.3%) of NNRTI TDRM (p = 0.014). NRTI A62 (5.6%), NNRTI E138 and K103 (5.6 and 4.2%, respectively) were the most prominent mutated sites. CONCLUSIONS: Most HIV-1-positive women diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018 were immigrants, with the relative ratio of FSU immigrants increasing in recent years. The high proportion of women diagnosed with resistance mutations, particularly, the yearly increase in the frequency of NNRTI mutations, support the national policy of resistance testing at baseline.","Wagner, Tali; Olshtain-Pops, Karen; Wax, Marina; Horwitz, Olivia; Shirazi, Rachel; Gozlan, Yael; Volnowitz, Hadar; Mendelson, Ella; Levy, Itzchak; Mor, Orna",BMC Infect Dis,,569

484001,Robotic Telemedicine for Mental Health: A Multimodal Approach to Improve Human-Robot Engagement,2021,"Learning related emotions (LREs) are determinant for students' achievement both in face-to-face and online education. Research has also shown that LREs tend to affect technology acceptance which in turn affects learning outcomes as well. Today though, the negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the sudden transmission to obligatory remote education might yield different functions of emotions and acceptance on learning outcomes. In this context, the current study seeks to model the relations between students' negative emotions, acceptance of (emergency) remote education, and self-perceived knowledge improvement. The suggested model was examined and validated on 116 university students that attended fully remote courses in Greece during the COVID-19 crisis. The results suggested that negative emotions of boredom and cognitive load are significant predictors of students' acceptance of remote learning components: i) online attending a lecture, ii) online communicating with professor, and iii) online collaborating with peers. Anxiety directly affected perceived knowledge improvement, boredom, and cognitive load; Boredom was also affected by cognitive load. In addition, acceptance of remote learning components indirectly affected perceived knowledge improvement mediated by learnability. Boredom was the strongest predictor of online attending a lecture and online collaborating with peers, while online communication with professor was the strongest predictor of learnability. The contribution of this study and the structural findings are further discussed in the paper.","Tzafilkou, Katerina; Perifanou, Maria; Economides, Anastasios A",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,569

Purpose To develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of CXR abnormalities. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19-Net, was trained, validated, and tested on CXRs from patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the COVID-19 positive CXRs, patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with positive pneumonia findings between February 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020 were included. For the non-COVID-19 CXRs, patients with pneumonia who underwent CXR between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test dataset containing 500 CXRs from 500 patients was evaluated by both the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists. Results A total of 2060 patients (5806 CXRs; mean age 62 ± 16, 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 CXRs; mean age 64 ± 18, 1578 men) with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training + validation and test datasets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91, 0.93) corresponding to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87%, 89%) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77%, 80%) using a high sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77%, 79%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88%, 90%) using a high specificity operating threshold. For the 500 sampled CXRs, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) compared to a 0.85 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.88) of radiologists. Conclusion CV19-Net was able to differentiate COVID-19 related pneumonia from other types of pneumonia with performance exceeding that of experienced thoracic radiologists.","Zhang, Ran; Tie, Xin; Qi, Zhihua; Bevins, Nicholas B; Zhang, Chengzhu; Griner, Dalton; Song, Thomas K; Nadig, Jeffrey D; Schiebler, Mark L; Garrett, John W; Li, Ke; Reeder, Scott B; Chen, Guang-Hong",Radiology,,569
484746,Influences of Temporal Factors on GPS-based Human Mobility Lifestyle,2020-09-22,"OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is a dramatic and lethal clinical condition with a high risk of death. Emerging evidence indicates a role for miRNAs in AAA pathogenesis, therefore we aimed to identify miRNAs that differently expressed in exosomes from AAA patients and explore the underlying mechanisms of how miR-106a plays its role in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from plasma of AAA patients, as well as from the tissue-conditioned culture medium. The exosomal expression profiles of several miRNAs including miR-106a were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. To determine the potential role of miR-106a in the pathogenesis of AAA, miR-106a was overexpressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and then cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Afterwards, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the expression levels of some proteins involved in the modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Furthermore, the target gene of miR-106a was predicted and verified through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: MiR-106a was up-regulated in exosomes from plasma of those patients with AAA as compared with healthy peers. Likely, increased level of miR-106a was observed in exosomes released from AAA tissue in comparison to those from adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-106a in VSMCs suppressed cell viability but promoted cellular apoptosis, whereas inhibition of miR-106a in VSMCs resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the control group. In addition, the protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-12) secreted from VSMCs were significantly up-regulated, while their inhibitor TIMP-2 was down-regulated due to miR-106a overexpression. Finally, TIMP-2 was validated subsequently as the direct target of miR-106a through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our results suggest that increased expression of miR-106a promotes VSMC cell apoptosis and down-regulates TIMP-2 through directly targeting its 3'-UTR, which in turn restores MMP production and ultimately accelerates ECM degradation. Therefore miR-106a is proposed to play a crucial role in AAA development and this will provide an update on the understanding of the clinical value of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.","Han, Z-L; Wang, H-Q; Zhang, T-S; He, Y-X; Zhou, H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,569

A randomised clinical trial blinded for outcome evaluation. Forty-eight family caregivers of older adults surviving a stroke took part in the study. The intervention group (IG) received three home visits by nurses in 1 month after hospital discharge for guidance on the disease and care activities for the elderly people. The control group (CG) relied on the service network that had access. The Caregiver Burden Scale was applied to assess the burden outcome 1 week, 60 days and 1 year after hospital discharge. The caregivers of the intervention and CGs had no difference regarding baseline data. There was an interaction effect between the CG and the IG in the isolation domain (p = 0.037) and in the emotional involvement domain (p = 0.003) over time. These findings provide support for strengthening a care line for the elderly people after a stroke, with adequate discharge planning, indicating the importance of integrating care network services such as primary care, home care and hospital care with a view to achieving an effective care transition. It is also necessary to construct a specific instrument to evaluate other outcomes, such as the knowledge and learning of caregivers in relation to the care activities taught.

We analyse data of COVID-19 symptoms, as self-reported in a weekly online survey, which is open to all Belgian citizens. We predict symptoms' incidence using binomial models for spatially discrete data, and we introduce these as a covariate in the spatial analysis of COVID-19 incidence, as reported by the Belgian government during the days following a survey round. The symptoms' incidence is moderately predictive of the variation in the relative risks based on the confirmed cases; exceedance probability maps of the symptoms' incidence and confirmed cases' relative risks overlap partly. We conclude that this framework can be used to detect COVID-19 clusters of substantial sizes, but it necessitates spatial information on finer scales to locate small clusters.","Neyens, Thomas; Faes, Christel; Vranckx, Maren; Pepermans, Koen; Hens, Niel; Van Damme, Pierre; Molenberghs, Geert; Aerts, Jan; Beutels, Philippe",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,,569

COVID-19 is triggered by a novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Baseline characteristics of admitted patients with COVID-19 show that adiposity, diabetes, and hypertension are risk factors for developing severe disease, but so far immunosuppressed patients who are listed as high-risk patients have not been more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than the rest of the population. Multiple clinical trials are currently being conducted, which may identify more drugs that can lower mortality, morbidity, and burden on the society. Several independent studies have convincingly shown that cyclosporine inhibit replication of several different coronaviruses in vitro. The cyclosporine-analog alisporivir has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These findings are intriguing, although there is no clinical evidence for a protective effect to reduce the likelihood of severe COVID-19 or to treat the immune storm or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that often causes severe morbidity.

For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was -2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 2.2; P = 0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.

During the first months, no rapid and reliable detecting tool was readily available to sufficiently respond to the requirement of massive testing. In this situation, when the development of an effective vaccine requires at least a few months, it is crucial to be prepared by developing and commercializing affordable, accurate, rapid and adaptable biosensors not only to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also to be armed to avoid the pandemic in the earliest stages in the future. The COVID-19 diagnostic tools are categorized into two main groups of Nucleic Acid (NA)-based and protein-based tests. To date, nucleic acid-based detection has been announced as the gold-standard strategy for coronavirus detection;however, protein-based tests are promising alternatives for rapid and large-scale screening of susceptible groups. In this review, we discuss the current protein-based biosensing tools, the research advances and the potential protein-detecting strategies for COVID-19 detection. This narrative review aims to highlight the importance of the diagnostic tests, encourage the academic research groups and the companies to eliminate the shortcomings of the current techniques and step forward to mass-producing reliable point-of-care (POC) and point-of-need (PON) adaptable diagnostic tools for large-scale screening in the future outbreaks.","Shaffaf, T.; Ghafar-Zadeh, E.",Bioengineering,,569
488744,The Norwegian Football Family and Strategic Crisis Communication,2020,"This study was aimed at providing practical information to improve Korean adolescents' wellness by empirically identifying its correlation with sports participation and having an internal health locus of control (IHLC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study comprised both a pilot test and a main study. We recruited 844 Korean adolescents as subjects in January 2021 to participate in an online self-reported survey. The reliability and validity of the scales used (sports participation, IHLC, and wellness) were verified through a pilot test. In the main study, we verified the differences between all variables according to adolescents' demographic characteristics and the structural relationship of sports participation, IHLC, and wellness. Sports participation had a positive effect on IHLC (p < 0.001) and wellness (p < 0.001). Additionally, IHLC had a positive effect on wellness (p < 0.001). In juvenile educational institutions, there is a need to develop strategies to increase wellness, sports participation, and IHLC among adolescent students, which can improve their wellness in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Dae-Jung; So, Wi-Young; Lee, Seung-Man",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,569

However, whether obesity is a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 has been hardly investigated so far. METHODS: We examined the association between BMI level and the risk of COVID-19 infection in a nationwide case-control study comprised of 3,788 case patients confirmed with COVID-19 between January 24 and April 9, 2020 and 15,152 controls matched by age and sex, who were aged 20 years or more and underwent National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) health examinations between 2015-2017, using data from the Korean NHIS with linkage to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Our primary exposure of interest was BMI level categorized into four groups; &18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23-24.9 (overweight), and &#8805;25 kg/m 2 (obese). RESULTS: Of the entire 18,940 study population, 11,755 (62.1%) were women, and the mean (SD) age of the study participants was 53.7 (13.8) years. In multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, comorbidity, laboratory and medication data, there was a graded association between higher BMI levels and higher risk of COVID-19 infection; compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted ORs in the overweight and obese individuals were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.03-1.25) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.39), respectively. This association was robust across age and sex subgroups.

489845,Human-Centered Design Smart Clothing for Ambient Assisted Living of Elderly Users: Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541). SETTING: Denmark, April and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use. INTERVENTION: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection. LIMITATION: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others. CONCLUSION: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.

490295,Law Teaching and the Coronavirus Pandemic*,2020,"Background: In the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak, there is a strong need to find strategies to monitor SARSCoV-2 transmission. While the application of screening techniques plays a major role to this end, there is evidence challenging the real significance of seroconversion. We reported a case of COVID-19 reactivation associated with a neurosurgical operation with early neuropsychiatric involvement presumably promoted by olfactory and gustatory impairment in the first infection. Case Descriptio: A 57-year-old man was referred for a 2-month history of progressive development of imbalance, dizziness, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed two bilateral hemispheric cerebellar lesions. In line with our triage protocol, the patient underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 detection, which resulted positive. Of note, the patient had reported in the previous month hyposmia and hypogeusia. After a period of 14 days, three new swabs were performed with negative results, leading the way to surgery. In the early post-operative period, the patient manifested acute onset of psychotic symptoms with hyperactive delirium, followed by fever and acute respiratory failure. A chest computed tomography revealed a specific pattern of ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, suggesting a viral pneumonia. Serological tests demonstrated the seroconversion and a new nasopharyngeal swab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Our report highlights the importance of comprehensive screening assessments in sensitive cases highly susceptible to COVID-19 recurrence.

However, for some social groups, such as children and adolescents, this measure carries a contradiction: the home, which should be the safest place for them, is also a frequent environment of a sad aggravation: domestic violence. This study aims to evaluate the notifications of interpersonal/self-inflicted violence available in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases in the State of Santa Catarina (southern Brazil), for the juvenile age group, before and during the new coronavirus pandemics. METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive study of violence against children and adolescents (from 0 to 19 years) notified by health professionals by completing and entering the occurrence in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases of the State of Santa Catarina in 11 weeks in which the social isolation measure was instituted as mandatory, comparing with the same period before this measure. RESULTS: During the study period, 136 municipalities in Santa Catarina made 1,851 notifications. There was a decrease of 55.3% of them in the isolation period, and the difficulties encountered in seeking protection and assistance institutions were listed. CONCLUSIONS: The society needs to be aware of possible cases of violence in the children and adolescent population. It is important to provide accessible, effective, and safe ways for complaints and notifications, as well as a quick response to the cases, aiming at protecting victims and minimizing damages to prevent the perpetuation of the violence.","Platt, Vanessa Borges; Guedert, Jucélia Maria; Coelho, Elza Berger Salema",Rev Paul Pediatr,,569

Globally, more than 3,517,345 cases have been confirmed with 243,401 deaths due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. The antiviral drug discovery activity is required to control the persistence of COVID-19 circulation and the potential of the future emergence of coronavirus. However, the present review aims to highlight the important antiviral approaches, including interferons, ribavirin, mycophenolic acids, ritonavir, lopinavir, inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provoke the nonstructural proteins and deactivate the structural and essential host elements of the virus to control and treat the infection of COVID-19 by inhibiting the viral entry, viral RNA replication and suppressing the viral protein expression. Moreover, the present review investigates the epidemiology, diagnosis, structure, and replication of COVID-19 for better understanding. It is recommended that these proteases, inhibitors, and antibodies could be a good therapeutic option in drug discovery to control the newly emerged coronavirus.HighlightsCOVID-19 has more than 79.5% identical sequence to SARS-CoV and a 96% identical sequence of the whole genome of bat coronaviruses.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and septic shock are the possible clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19.Different antivirals, including interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be the potent therapeutic agents against COVID-19.The initial clinical trials on hydroquinone in combination with azithromycin showed an admirable result in the reduction of COVID-19.The overexpression of inflammation response, cytokine dysregulation, and induction of apoptosis could be an well-organized factors to reduce the pathogenicity of COVID-19.","Hazafa, Abu; Ur-Rahman, Khalil; Haq, Ikram-Ul-; Jahan, Nazish; Mumtaz, Muhammad; Farman, Muhammad; Naeem, Huma; Abbas, Faheem; Naeem, Muhammad; Sadiqa, Sania; Bano, Saira",Drug Metab Rev,,569

Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycan-processing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design.","Watanabe, Yasunori; Allen, Joel D; Wrapp, Daniel; McLellan, Jason S; Crispin, Max",Science (Wash.),,569

METHODS: Whole-blood from 56 COVID-19 and 23 ""NO-COVID-19"" individuals were stimulated overnight with different concentrations (0.1 or 1 µg/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator® Peptide Pools, including spike (pool S), nucleocapsid (pool N), membrane (pool M), and a MegaPool (MP) of these three peptide pools. ELISA was used to analyse interferon (IFN)-Î³ levels. RESULTS: The IFN-Î³-response to every SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with NO-COVID-19 individuals. Pool S and MegaPool were the most potent immunogenic stimuli (median: 0.51, IQR: 0.14-2.17; and median: 1.18, IQR: 0.27-4.72, respectively) compared with pools N and M (median: 0.22, IQR: 0.032-1.26; and median: 0.22, IQR: 0.01-0.71, respectively). The whole-blood test based on pool S and MegaPool showed a good sensitivity of 77% and a high specificity of 96%. The IFN-Î³-response was mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and independently detected of clinical parameters in both hospitalized and recovered patients. CONCLUSIONS: This easy-to-use assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses may be implemented in clinical laboratories as a powerful diagnostic tool.","Aiello, Alessandra; Najafi Fard, Saeid; Petruccioli, Elisa; Petrone, Linda; Vanini, Valentina; Farroni, Chiara; Cuzzi, Gilda; Navarra, Assunta; Gualano, Gina; Mosti, Silvia; Pierelli, Luca; Nicastri, Emanuele; Goletti, Delia",Int J Infect Dis,,569

This led not only to a delayed end of treatment but also to accidents and complications. The present study tried to evaluate the orthodontic situation both from the patient's and orthodontist's point of view, so the patients were given a few questions to answer, and the orthodontist analyzed each treatment before and after the two-month lockdown and decided if it was mildly or severely affected by the absence of check-ups. The study group consisted of 105 patients evaluated by three orthodontists in the same private practice. Patients that have gotten worse after the lockdown or who had problems were included in the study. Also, all the patients were given a 7-question form in order to find out their opinion. After two months without check-ups, our orthodontists found that 9.52% got worse because of the lack of intermaxillary elastics, broken brackets, broken removable orthodontic appliances, and others. Most of the patients believe that their treatment was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, but none of the patients felt unsafe when visiting the clinic. The Covid-19 pandemic had severe effects on orthodontic treatments. Orthodontists noticed a delay for about one-third of their patients. However, from the patient's point of view, half believe that their treatment was negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in different degrees.","Morosan, Hariclea",J Med Life,,569

496640,What Can We Estimate From Fatality and Infectious Case Data Using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) Model? A Case Study of Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Mobility-On-Demand (MoD) services have been transforming the urban mobility ecosystem. However, they raise a lot of concerns for their impact on congestion, Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), and competition with transit. There are also questions about their long-term survival because of inherent inefficiencies in their operations. Considering the popularity of the MoD services, increasing ride-pooling is an important means to address these concerns. Shareability depends not only on riders attitudes and preferences but also on operating models deployed by providers. The paper introduces an advance requests operating model for ride pooling where users may request rides at least H minutes in advance of their desired departure times. A platform with efficient algorithms for request matching, vehicle routing, rebalancing, and flexible user preferences is developed. A large-scale transportation network company dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the advance requests system relative to current practices. The impacts of various design aspects of the system (advance requests horizon, vehicle capacity) on its performance are investigated. The sensitivity of the results to user preferences in terms of the level of service (time to be served and excess trip time), willingness to share and place requests in advance, and traffic conditions are explored. The results suggest that significant benefits in terms of sustainability, level of service, and fleet utilization can be realized when advance requests are along with an increased willingness to share. Furthermore, even near-on-demand (relative short advance planning horizons) operations can offer many benefits for all stakeholders involved (passengers, operators, and cities).","Ma, Zhenliang; Koutsopoulos, Haris N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00823v1.pdf,569
496724,"Covid-19 transition, could Twitter support UK Universities?",2020,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, elective invasive cardiac procedures (ICP) have been frequently cancelled or postponed. Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Among patients in whom an elective invasive cardiac procedure is cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic, mortality and cardiovascular mortality is higher in patients with diabetes, irrespectively on other clinical conditions. These procedures should not be cancelled in patients with diabetes.","Moreno, Raúl; Díez, José-Luis; Diarte, José-Antonio; Salinas, Pablo; de la Torre Hernández, José María; Andres-Cordón, Juan F; Trillo, Ramiro; Briales, Juan Alonso; Amat-Santos, Ignacio; Romaguera, Rafael; Díaz, José-Francisco; Vaquerizo, Beatriz; Ojeda, Soledad; Cruz-González, Ignacio; Morena-Salas, Daniel; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Sarnago, Fernando; Portero, Pilar; Gutierrez-Barrios, Alejandro; Alfonso, Fernando; Bosch, Eduard; Pinar, Eduardo; Ruiz-Arroyo, José-Ramón; Ruiz-Quevedo, Valeriano; Jiménez-Mazuecos, Jesús; Lozano, Fernando; Rumoroso, José-Ramón; Novo, Enrique; Irazusta, Francisco J; García Del Blanco, Bruno; Moreu, José; Ballesteros-Pradas, Sara M; Frutos, Araceli; Villa, Manuel; Alegría-Barrero, Eduardo; Lázaro, Rosa; Paredes, Emilio",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,569

We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with COVID-19, epithelial cells showed an average three-fold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared to moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand-receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells, including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF. The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared to moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure. Our data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of the CCR1 and/or CCR5 pathways might suppress immune hyperactivation in critical COVID-19.","Chua, Robert Lorenz; Lukassen, Soeren; Trump, Saskia; Hennig, Bianca P; Wendisch, Daniel; Pott, Fabian; Debnath, Olivia; Thürmann, Loreen; Kurth, Florian; Völker, Maria Theresa; Kazmierski, Julia; Timmermann, Bernd; Twardziok, Sven; Schneider, Stefan; Machleidt, Felix; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Maier, Melanie; Krannich, Alexander; Schmidt, Sein; Balzer, Felix; Liebig, Johannes; Loske, Jennifer; Suttorp, Norbert; Eils, Jürgen; Ishaque, Naveed; Liebert, Uwe Gerd; von Kalle, Christof; Hocke, Andreas; Witzenrath, Martin; Goffinet, Christine; Drosten, Christian; Laudi, Sven; Lehmann, Irina; Conrad, Christian; Sander, Leif-Erik; Eils, Roland",Nat Biotechnol,,569

METHODS: Prospective observational single-center cohort study of adult PLWH reporting symptoms of COVID-19. We assessed clinical characteristics, risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity, and standardized incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 cases in PLWH cohort and in Barcelona. RESULTS: From 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, 53 out of 5683 (0.9% confidence interval 0.7-1.2%) PLWH were diagnosed with COVID-19. Median age was 44 years, CD4 T cells were 618/µl and CD4/CD8 was 0.90. All but two individuals were virologically suppressed. Cough (87%) and fever (82%) were the most common symptoms. Twenty-six (49%) were admitted, six (14%) had severe disease, four (8%) required ICU admission, and two (4%) died. Several laboratory markers (lower O2 saturation and platelets, and higher leukocytes, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, C reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were associated with COVID-19 severity. No HIV or antiretroviral-related factors were associated with COVID-19 diagnosis or severity. Standardized incidence rate ratios of confirmed or confirmed/probable COVID-19 in PLWH were 38% (95% confidence interval 27-52%, Pâ<â0.0001) and 33% (95% confidence interval 21-50%, Pâ<â0.0001), respectively relative to the general population. CONCLUSION: PLWH with COVID-19 did not differ from the rest of the HIV cohort. Clinical presentation, severity rate, and mortality were not dependent on any HIV-related or antiretroviral-related factor.

501916,AI in Fighting Covid-19: Pandemic Management,2021,"ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that also functions extracellularly, signaling through the LFA-1 integrin to promote interferon (IFN)-Î³ release from natural killer (NK) and T cells. The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-ß-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-Î³-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15.","Swaim, Caleb D; Canadeo, Larissa A; Monte, Kristen J; Khanna, Swati; Lenschow, Deborah J; Huibregtse, Jon M",Cell Rep,,569

Based on the knowledge that the oral epithelium is the initial site exposed to e-cigarette smoke, we assessed the hypothesis that e-cigarette smoking modifies the biology of oral epithelium of healthy e-cigarette smokers. Methods: Oral biopsies of n=23 healthy nonsmoker controls and n=24 healthy e-cigarette smokers (e-cigarette smokers for an average of 2.0 ± 1.0 years) matched for age, gender and ethnicity, were compared based on pathology and RNA transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 sequencing. The mRNA data were assessed in e-cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers genome-wide (n=19,724);genes previously identified as significantly dysregulated in the oral epithelium of e-cigarette smokers vs nonsmokers (n=758);genes previously identified as significantly dysregulated in the small airway epithelium of nonsmokers following an acute exposure to e-cigarettes (n=71);and genes related to the initial steps of COVID-19 infection, including ACE2, the COVID-19 receptor (n=9). The miRNA of e-cigarette smokers and nonsmokers was compared on a genome-wide basis (n=1,100 mature and human miRNAs). All comparisons were performed using ANOVA, Benajmini-Hochberg corrected p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results: The morphology of the epithelium and lamina propria in e-cigarette smokers was normal, with no thickening of the epithelium, dysplasia, basilar hyperplasia, dyskeratosis, and no abnormal vascularity, or inflammatory infiltration. The basilar layer in ecigarette smokers appeared normal, with normal mitotic activity and no nuclear pleomorphism. Assessment of the transcriptome, both on mRNA and miRNA levels, based on all gene lists did not identify any genes significantly modified in the oral epithelium of e-cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers.

503072,Smart and Resilient Urban Futures for Sustainability in the Post COVID-19 Era: A Review of Policy Responses on Urban Mobility,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cases of the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in Kenya have continued to increase rapidly, since the first case in the country was confirmed in March 2020. In the wake of the pandemic, the health and socio-economic challenges experienced by the youth in Kenya are likely to be elevated. We assessed knowledge, practices, perceived risk of infection, adoption of recommended behaviour and the effects of COVID-19 among the youth in Kenya. METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted between April 30th to May 7th, 2020 through a combined online survey and phone interviews. A total of 2156 youth across all 47 counties in Kenya completed the responses to the study questions. All survey responses analyzed using Stata version 15 were tabulated by gender, age, and education level to generate basic descriptive tables and tested for differences by category using chi-square tests. Where applicable, linear and logistic regression analysis model was conducted using covariates such as employment status, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Knowledge on symptoms of COVID-19 was generally high. Female respondents were more likely to identify more symptoms correctly compared to men (p < 0.001). However, youth reported very low levels of anyone being at risk of infection (7.1%). Most youth have adopted behavior necessary to slow down the infection. There were generally very low reported levels of inability to access health services related to sexual and reproductive health. About 50.0% of respondents reported significant decline in income during the pandemic period, nearly a third reported living in fear while 26.5% reported feeling stressed. CONCLUSION: There was high knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, preventive strategies, and high adoption of preventive practices. Strategies to sustain behaviors positively adopted among young people will be critical to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Despite the low reported rates of inability to access sexual and reproductive health, response measures should include strategies that facilitate continuity of services among young people. The reported social effects of the pandemic show the need for interventions to meet the health and socio-economic needs of the youth and minimize the long-term consequences of the pandemic.","Karijo, Evalin; Wamugi, Sylvia; Lemanyishoe, Samuel; Njuki, Jenny; Boit, Faith; Kibui, Vania; Karanja, Sarah; Abuya, Timothy",BMC Public Health,,569
503221,Erratum,2020,"The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has made serious threats to the public health. Antibodies have been considered as promising therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathogens. So far, effectors that can influence the sustainability of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients are still unclear. In this paper, we attempted to find potential key factors correlated with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Transcriptional analysis with the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed proportional changes of immune cell subsets in COVID-19 convalescent patients, including a substantial decrease of monocytes and evident increase of dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, we found that the gene expressions of chemokines associated with monocyte/macrophage were significantly up-regulated during the COVID-19 recovery phase. Most importantly, we found a set of 27 immune genes corresponding to a comparatively lower amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, and identified two hub genes, IL1ß and IL6, the protein expressions of which exhibited negative correlation with the immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in COVID-19 convalescent sera. In addition, we found that high expressions of these 2 hub genes during the convalescent stage were negatively associated with the plasma cell marker CD138. Our study presented two key inflammatory factors correlated to the low level of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, which indicated the potential regulatory process of plasmatic antibodies levels in some COVID-19 convalescent patients.","Li, Shenglong; Wang, Wang; Li, Tingting; Han, Xiaojian; Hu, Chao; Wang, Yingming; Shen, Meiying; Du, Li; Nai, Yaru; Wang, Jianwei; Jin, Aishun",,,569
503421,COVID-19 Vaccines and the Skin: The landscape of cutaneous vaccine reactions worldwide,2021,"Patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable to complications from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Recurrent hospital visits and hospital admission are potential risk factors for acquiring infection with its causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus−2 (SARS-CoV-2). As immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) constitute the therapeutic backbone for the vast majority of patients with advanced lung cancer in the absence of actionable driver oncogenes, there have been intense discussions within the oncology community regarding risk-benefit of delaying these treatments or use of alternative extended-interval treatment strategies to minimize the risk of viral transmission secondary to unintended nosocomial exposures. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for extended-interval strategy of pembrolizumab at a dose of 400 mg every 6 weeks for all already approved oncologic indications. Herein, we summarize the evidence from the in silico pharmacokinetic modeling/simulation studies supporting extended-interval dosing strategies for the ICIs used in lung cancer. We further review the evolving clinical evidence behind these approaches and predict that they will continue to be used in routine practice even long after the pandemic, particularly for patients with durable disease control.","Sehgal, Kartik; Costa, Daniel B.; Rangachari, Deepa",Front.

504105,Characterizing Online Engagement with Disinformation and Conspiracies in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,2021-07-17,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had severe political, economic, and societal effects, it has also affected media and communication systems in unprecedented ways. While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous""fake news""or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial computational content analysis of alternative news media's output on Facebook during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis, methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined, as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in this analysis.","Boberg, Svenja; Quandt, Thorsten; Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim; Frischlich, Lena",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02566v3.pdf,569

The aim of this study was to identify the functional scope of weekly infection control team rounding (ICTR) in an acute care hospital. We conducted weekly ICTR between January 18 and December 26, 2018 to improve the compliance to infection control and prevention measures at a 734-bed academic hospital in the Republic of Korea and analyzed the results retrospectively. We categorized the results into five groups: ""well maintained,"" ""improvement needed,"" ""long-term support, such as space or manpower, needed,"" ""not applicable,"" or ""could not be observed"". A total of nine categories and 85 sub-elements of infection control and prevention practices were evaluated. The median number of infection control team (ICT) visits per department was 7 (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-7). The ICT assessed a median of 16 elements (IQR: 12-22), and a total of 7452 results were obtained. Of those, 75% were monitored properly, 22% were ""not applicable"", and 4% were difficult to observe. The most common practices that were difficult to observe were strategies to prevent catheter-related surgical site infections, pneumonia, and occupationally acquired infections as well as injection safety practices. Although the ICTR was able to maintain regular visits to each department, further strategies beyond regular ICTR are needed to reduce category of ""could not observed"". This pilot study may provide an important reference for institutional infection prevention practices as it is the first study to investigate the functional coverage of ICTR.","Jeong, Yeon Su; Kim, Jin Hwa; Lee, Seungju; Lee, So Young; Oh, Sun Mi; Lee, Eunjung; Kim, Tae Hyong; Park, Se Yoon",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,569
504410,The negotiation of EU–China comprehensive agreement on investment and its potential impact in the post-pandemic era,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by a new viral pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global health emergency. This debilitating viral pandemic not only paralyzed the normal daily life of the global community but also spread rapidly via global travel. To date there are no effective vaccines or specific treatments against this highly contagious virus; therefore, there is an urgent need to advocate novel prophylactic or therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. This brief opinion critically discusses the potential of Silymarin, a flavonolignan with diverse pharmacological activity having antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antiplatelet, and antiviral properties, with versatile immune-cytokine regulatory functions, that able to bind with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and induce endogenous antiviral cytokine interferon-stimulated gene 15, for the management of COVID-19. Silymarin inhibits the expression of host cell surface receptor TMPRSS2 with a docking binding energy corresponding to -1,350.61 kcal/mol and a full fitness score of -8.11. The binding affinity of silymarin with an impressive virtual score exhibits significant potential to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication. We propose in-depth pre-clinical and clinical review studies of silymarin for the development of anti-COVID-19 lead, based on its clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and multifaceted bioactivities.","Palit, Partha; Mukhopadhyay, Aparna; Chattopadhyay, Debprasad",Phytother. res,,569
504427,Planning for the Pandemic: A Community Hospital Story,2021,"According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide. They may be caused by various factors or combinations of factors. Frequently, endothelial dysfunction is involved in either development of the disorder or results from it. On the other hand, the endothelium may be disordered for other reasons, e.g., due to infection, such as COVID-19. The understanding of the role and significance of the endothelium in the body has changed significantly over time-from a simple physical barrier to a complex system encompassing local and systemic regulation of numerous processes in the body. Endothelium disorders may arise from impairment of one or more signaling pathways affecting dilator or constrictor activity, including nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate activation, prostacyclin-cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and potassium channel activation or intracellular calcium level inhibition. In this review, plants are summarized as sources of biologically active substances affecting the endothelium. This paper compares individual substances and mechanisms that are known to affect the endothelium, and which subsequently may cause the development of cardiovascular disorders.","Bartáková, Anna; Nováková, Marie",Int. j. mol. sci.

AIMS: We investigated the association of exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a culturally diverse sample of adults in Quebec (Canada). METHOD: A total of 3273 residents of the province of Quebec (49% aged 18-39 years, 57% women, 51% belonging to a minority ethno-cultural group) completed an online survey. We used linear and ordinal logistic regression to identify the relationship between COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and the moderating role of ethno-cultural identity. RESULTS: Mental health varied significantly based on socioeconomic status and ethno-cultural group, with those with lower incomes and Arab participants reporting higher psychological distress. Exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination, and stigma were associated with poorer mental health. Associations with mental health varied across ethno-cultural groups, with exposed and discriminated Black participants reporting higher mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate sociocultural inequalities in mental health related to COVID-19 in the Canadian context. COVID-19-related risk factors, including exposure, discrimination and stigma, jeopardise mental health. This burden is most noteworthy for the Black community. There is an urgent need for public health authorities and health professionals to advocate against the discrimination of racialised minorities, and ensure that mental health services are accessible and culturally sensitive during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Miconi, Diana; Li, Zhi Yin; Frounfelker, Rochelle L; Santavicca, Tara; Cénat, Jude Mary; Venkatesh, Vivek; Rousseau, Cécile",BJPsych Open,,569

Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested. METHODS: The mesh terms of ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" (Supplementary Concept) and ""COVID-19 drug treatment"" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with ""COVID."" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in the following research projects. Steroids and tocilizumab have been considered beneficial in the cytokine storm phase.","Kheirabadi, Dorna; Haddad, Fatemeh; Mousavi-Roknabadi, Razieh S; Rezaeisadrabadi, Mohammad; Dehghan, Hamidreza; Fazlzadeh, Aylar",J. med. virol,,569

We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"".

Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts. The resulting consequences may form a 'vicious cycle', with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. These perspectives can enable a holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and COVID-19-specific vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by Black women and birthing people. Syndemic-informed research can then lead to impactful multi-level prevention strategies that simultaneously tackle both endemic and COVID-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time.","Lemke, Michael Kenneth; Brown, Kyrah K",Matern Child Health J,,569

511102,"Experience of treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: New Delhi, India",2021,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been growing reports of racial harassment targeting Asian Americans. We study one such manifestation of racial harassment that Asian employees may face in the workplace: Leaders' use of stigmatizing labels for COVID-19 such as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu."" Integrating organizational justice theories with research on racial harassment in the workplace, we theorize that leaders' use of stigmatizing COVID-19 labels reduces employees' perceptions of interpersonal justice, which subsequently impact employees' emotional exhaustion and work engagement. We further theorize that while such effects will be stronger among Asian employees who experience both moral anger and reduced public collective self-esteem, that the effects will also be present among non-Asian employees who experience moral anger. Using one survey (Study 1) and one experiment (Study 2), we find support for our predictions. We find that leaders' use of stigmatizing language to depict COVID-19 leads to deleterious workplace experiences for employees, and especially for Asian employees. The current research thus deepens our understanding of the relatively understudied work experiences of Asian Americans and brings to light the underlying psychological mechanisms linking racial harassment and employee work outcomes for both targeted employees and employees not targeted.

By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020.The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups. There is also a need to expedite the tabling of Tobacco Control Bill in coming parliament session which is long overdue.

In this study, the performance of one laboratory-developed test (LDT) and two commercial tests, cobas SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag COVID-19 (Mobidiag), were evaluated for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory specimens. A total of 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement was highest for the cobas test (100%), followed by the Amplidiag test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement was lowest for the cobas test (89.4%), followed by the Amplidiag test (98.8%), and the highest value was obtained for the LDT (100%). The dilution series of positive specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas assay in comparison with the other two assays, and the low negative percent agreement value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months to mitigate the pandemic.

Examining the relationship between fasting status, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with circulating BCAA levels may provide insights into their metabolic handling. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses among 25,740 Women's Health Study participants (mean age 55 years). RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression models, fasting was associated with lower plasma BCAAs vs. non-fasting in women without metabolic syndrome or T2D (% mean difference=-5.1%; 95% CI=-5.8, -4.5) and among women with metabolic syndrome only (-3.7%; -4.9, -2.6), pinteraction=0.002. However, there was no difference in BCAAs by fasting status among women with T2D (0.4%; -3.7, 4.7). CONCLUSIONS: We observed higher BCAAs with worsening metabolic health status. Fasting is modestly associated with lower plasma BCAAs, except among women with T2D. These findings support hypotheses that impaired BCAA catabolism may be a feature of T2D pathophysiology.","Tobias, Deirdre K; Mora, Samia; Verma, Subodh; Billia, Filio; Buring, Julie E; Lawler, Patrick R",Metabolism,,569

Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Although the majority of patients recover, there are still a significant number of patients who progress to respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death. The virus is mainly spread during close contact and by small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Because of the highly contagious element and easy spread in a communal living arrangement that exists within an inpatient psychiatric hospitals, the following guidelines were established to improve patient and staff safety while still maintaining efficiency and capability to provide this needed treatment to a subgroup of patients.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate perceived comfort in communication about end-of-life and palliative care among healthcare providers in Nairobi, Kenya and to evaluate a pilot webinar-based communication training series. METHODS: Through a partnership with a research hospital in Nairobi, healthcare providers engaged an online survey to assess perceived comfort in communication and prior educational training in communication. The COMFORT communication model was used to develop and pilot a webinar-based communication training series to meet training needs. Pre-post measures of comfort in communication and post-curriculum evaluation were used to evaluate the webinars. RESULTS: Survey findings from 94 healthcare providers demonstrated that communication training is most needed when patient/family culture is different from provider. Physicians reported less comfort in communication than nurses and other professionals, especially in communication with family about spiritual or religious concerns. Nurses reported more overall training in palliative care communication topics than physicians and other disciplines. The 3-part webinar series increased communication comfort for physicians and nurses, was highly rated, and participants reported that they would recommend COMFORT webinar training to colleagues. CONCLUSION: Webinar-based platforms for communication training show promise for meeting communication training needs of healthcare providers.","Wittenberg, Elaine; Alabere, Regina Ogechi; Beltran, Emeline; Goldsmith, Joy V; Moledina, Shabnam",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,569

In this cross-sectional case-control study, 30 patients diagnosed with tubal ectopic pregnancy in the gynecology clinic of a tertiary hospital constituted the study group. A healthy pregnant control group (n = 30) was formed of age, body mass index (BMI), and gestational week-matched subjects, and a healthy non-pregnant control group (n = 30) was formed of age and BMI-matched women. The groups were compared in terms of demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters including serum zinc (Zn) level, serum copper (Cu) level, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level, serum catalase (CAT) activity, serum glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The groups were similar in respect of demographic characteristics. In the ectopic pregnancy group, serum GPX activity and Cu level were significantly lower, and serum SOD and CAT activity and Zn and MDA levels were higher compared with those of the healthy pregnant and healthy non-pregnant groups. The Cu/Zn ratio showed a significant, positive correlation with the serum GPX activity and serum progesterone level and a negative correlation with serum SOD and CAT activity. When 1.14 was taken as the cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity of the Cu/Zn ratio to determine ectopic pregnancy were 73.3% and 80.0%, respectively. Comparing the area under curve (AUC) in the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, the Cu/Zn ratio was determined to be more valuable than the Cu or Zn values alone in predicting ectopic pregnancy. In correlation analysis, serum beta hCG level showed a negative correlation with SOD and CAT activities and Zn levels. Serum progesterone level showed a negative correlation with serum CAT and SOD activities and MDA and zinc levels and a positive correlation with serum GPX activity and serum copper level (p < 0.05 for all). The current study can be considered of value as the first study in literature to show a significantly lower serum Zn level and higher serum Cu level in ectopic pregnancy cases compared with healthy pregnant control cases. This is also the first study to have revealed an association between the serum Cu/Zn ratio, oxidative status, and ectopic pregnancy. Furthermore, the serum Cu/Zn ratio was found to be useful in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy cases.","Tok, Abdullah; Özer, Alev; Baylan, Filiz Alkan; Kurutas, Ergül Bilge",Biol. trace elem. res,,569

In accordance with international studies, the Austrian data also suggests that the risk of death increases substantially with age. The observed age dependency of the proportions of registered COVID-19 deaths in relation to the population sizes in the age groups is approximately exponential, similar to the age dependency of the general age specific mortality rate. Furthermore, we compare the general age specific mortality rate in Austria with the estimates of the SARS-CoV­2 infection fatality rate by Ferguson et al. (2020). The parallels to the general age specific mortality rates do not imply that COVID-19 does not pose an additional risk. On the contrary, it follows from the structure and magnitude of the infection fatality rate that it is substantial, especially for higher age groups. However, since in many cases persons with severe pre-existing conditions are affected, it is not yet possible to estimate what effects COVID-19 will have on life expectancy.","Posch, Martin; Bauer, Peter; Posch, Alexander; König, Franz",Wien Klin Wochenschr,,569

Previously, the evolution pattern and similarity among the COVID-19 causative organism severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causative organisms of other similar infections have been determined using a single type of genetic marker in different studies. Herein, the SARS-CoV-2 and related ß coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, bat coronavirus (BAT-CoV) were comprehensively analyzed using a custom-built pipeline that employed phylogenetic approaches based on multiple types of genetic markers including the whole genome sequences, mutations in nucleotide sequences, mutations in protein sequences, and microsatellites. The whole-genome sequence-based phylogeny revealed that the strains of SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to the BAT-CoV strains. The mutational analysis showed that on average MERS-CoV and BAT-CoV genomes differed at 134.21 and 136.72 sites, respectively, whereas the SARS-CoV genome differed at 26.64 sites from the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the microsatellite analysis highlighted a relatively higher number of average microsatellites for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (106.8 and 107, respectively), and a lower number for SARS-CoV and BAT-CoV (95.8 and 98.5, respectively). Collectively, the analysis of multiple genetic markers of selected ß viral genomes revealed that the newly born SARS-COV-2 is closely related to BAT-CoV, whereas, MERS-CoV is more distinct from the SARS-CoV-2 than BAT-CoV and SARS-CoV.","Rehman, Hafiz Abdul; Ramzan, Farheen; Basharat, Zarrin; Shakeel, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Usman Ghani; Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmad",J Med Virol,,569

Although the spreading rate of COVID-19 is very high on October 6, 2020, the death rate is still less than 2.94%. Nonetheless, this review article shows that the lockdown has induced numerous positive impacts on the environment and on energy consumption. For instance, the lockdown has decreased the electricity demand by 30% in Italy, India, Germany, and the USA, and by 12-20% in France, Germany, Spain, India, and the UK. Additionally, the expenditure of the fuel supply has been decreased by 4% in 2020 as compared to the previous years (2012-2019). In particular, The global demand for coal fuel has been reduced by 8% in March and April 2020 as compared to the same time in 2019. In terms of harmful emissions, the lockdowns reduced the emissions of nitrous oxides by 20-30% in China, Italy, France, Spain, and by 77.3% in São Paulo, Brazil. Similarly, the particulate matter level has been reduced from 5-15% in Western Europe, to 200% in New Delhi, India, which in turn has enhanced the air quality in a never-seen manner in recent times. In some places, such as New York, USA, CO2 emission was also reduced by 5-10%. The water quality, in several polluted areas, has also been remarkably enhanced, for example, the dissolved oxygen content in the Ganga River, India, has increased by about 80%. Traffic congestion has also been reduced worldwide, and in some areas, it has been reduced by 50%, such as New York and Los Angeles, USA.

The study examined the outcomes between residents from 1 LCTF in WV who were moved to a hospital as compared to those remaining in the facility. METHODS: This cohort study compares mortality outcomes among severely symptomatic residents desiring hospitalization and those electing to stay at the facility receiving palliative opioids with supplemental oxygen. FINDINGS: Forty residents tested positive for COVID-19 with 11 developing severe respiratory symptoms. Eight residents elected to receive care at the LTCF while 3 desired hospitalization. Mortality was assessed at 4 time points and was not statistically different between those who were hospitalized versus those who received palliative opioids at the LTCF. Although not significant, the difference in mortality between those hospitalized (66.7%) and those receiving opioids at the LTCF (12.5%) in the acute phase trended toward significance (P = .072). Overall mortality at the 6-month time point among all residents who developed severe respiratory symptoms at this LTCF was 54.5%.

These ventilators should be rapidly deployable and with functional capabilities to manage COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our implementation offers robustness, safety and functionality absent in existing solutions to the ventilator shortage (i.e., telemonitoring, easy-to-disinfect, modularity) by maintaining simplicity. The design makes use of a manual resuscitator as the core respiration component activated by a compression mechanism which consist of two electronically controlled paddles. The quality measurements obtained after testing on a calibrated artificial lung demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities of manual ventilation. The complete design files are provided in the supplementary materials to facilitate ventilator production even in resource-limited settings. The implementation of this mechanical ventilator could eliminate device rationing or splitting to serve multiple patients on ICUs.","Chang, Javier; Acosta, Augusto; Benavides, Jorge; Reategui, Jaime; Rojas, Christiam; Cook, Jordi; Nole, Richard; Giampietri, Luigui; Pérez, Sandra; Casado, Fanny; Castaneda, Benjamín",HardwareX,,569

Additionally, the lockdown could be more difficult for those with lower Quality of Life (QoL). We aim to understand predictive factors of older adult's anxiety symptoms during the lockdown as it is a main psychological concern of COVID-19. METHODS: Four hundred eleven participants (Mageâ¯=â¯68.95, S.D.â¯=â¯5.60) completed questionnaires at two time points - before the pandemic and during the lockdown period. Cross-lagged analysis was carried out on two structural equation models - social isolation and anxiety symptoms, and QoL and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Baseline social isolation was associated with more anxiety symptoms at follow-up. However, baseline anxiety symptoms were not associated with social isolation subsequently. For QoL and anxiety symptoms, the relationship was bidirectional. CONCLUSION: Older adults who were previously socially isolated and had a lower QoL are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown.","Siew, Savannah Kiah Hui; Mahendran, Rathi; Yu, Junhong",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,569

METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 79 COVID-19 patients was retrospectively recruited from five independent institutions. For each presentation type, all patients were classified into atypical vs. typical groups (i.e., asymptomatic vs.symptomatic, CT imaging-negative vs. CT imaging-positive, and RP and non-RP,respectively). The chi-square test, Student's t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed to compare CT imaging and clinical features of atypical vs. typical patients for all three presentation categories. RESULTS: In our COVID-19 cohort, we found 12.7% asymptomatic patients, 13.9% CT imaging-negative patients, and 8.9% RP patients. The asymptomatic patients had fewer hospitalization days (P=0.043), lower total scores for bilateral lung involvement (P< 0.001), and fewer ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the peripheral area (P< 0.001) than symptomatic patients. The CT imaging-negative patients were younger (P=0.002), had a higher lymphocyte count (P=0.038), had a higher lymphocyte rate (P=0.008), and had more asymptomatic infections (P=0.002) than the CT imaging-positive patients. The RP patients with moderate COVID-19 had lower total scores of for bilateral lung involvement (P=0.030) and a smaller portion of the left lung affected (P=0.024) than non-RP patients. Compared to their first hospitalization, RP patients had a shorter hospitalization period (P< 0.001) and fewer days from the onset of illness to last RNA negative conversion (P< 0.001) at readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Significant CT imaging and clinical feature differences were found between atypical and typical COVID-19 patients for all three atypical presentation categories investigated in this study, which may help provide complementary information for the effective management of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhiqi; Chen, Xiaofeng; Huang, Ruibin; Li, Shengkai; Lin, Daiying; Yang, Zhijian; Sun, Hongfu; Liu, Guorui; Qiu, Jinming; Tang, Yanyan; Xiao, Jianning; Liao, Yuting; Wu, Xianheng; Wu, Renhua; Chen, Xiangguang; Dai, Zhuozhi",BMC Infect Dis,,569
520657,Supporting your team during a global pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a high prevalence of detectable troponin and myocardial injury. In addition, a subset of patients with COVID-19 has detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral loads. The objective of this study was to understand the relationship among SARS-CoV-2 viremia, detectable troponin, and myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was measured in plasma samples drawn from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at 2 academic medical centers. Baseline characteristics and clinically obtained high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) values were abstracted from the medical record. The main outcome was detectable hs-cTnT (&#8805;6 ng/mL) and myocardial injury (hs-cTnT &#8805;14 ng/mL; >99th percentile for assay). RESULTS: A total of 70 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, with 39% females and median age 58 ± 17 years; 21 patients (30%) were found to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral load and were classified in the viremia group. Patients with viremia were significantly older than those without viremia. All of the patients with viremia (100%) had detectable troponin during hospitalization compared with 59% of patients without viremia (P = 0.0003). Myocardial injury was seen in 76% of patients with viremia and 38% of those patients without viremia (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 viremia have a significantly higher prevalence of detectable troponin and myocardial injury during their hospitalization compared with patients who did not. This first report of the relationship among SARS-CoV-2 viremia, detectable troponin, and myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 points to additional mechanistic pathways that require deeper study to understand the complex interplay among these unique findings, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality in COVID-19.","Siddiqi, Hasan K; Weber, Brittany; Zhou, Guohai; Regan, James; Fajnzylber, Jesse; Coxen, Kendyll; Corry, Heather; Yu, Xu G; DiCarli, Marcelo; Li, Jonathan Z; Bhatt, Deepak L",Am. j. med,,569

This article explains the steps required to verify the death of an adult patient. Verification of death is not a mechanistic task, but one that requires sensitivity and compassion. It is also crucial that nurses understand the legal implications of verifying a patient's death. With the development of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nurses must also understand any changes in their role when verifying the death of a patient. Verification or confirmation of death is the process of ascertaining whether a patient is deceased, based on a physical assessment. Nurses can only verify a death if the patient is expected to die and has a do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) order in place. A DNACPR order is essential because it allows the nurse to verify the death without being concerned with the need to resuscitate the patient. Nurses should ensure they act in accordance with local and national guidance regarding the verification of a patient's death.

However, their prevalence in different patient populations still needs to be clarified. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from March 27 to April 1, 2020, in Northern Italy. Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD. Two groups were studied: group A, patients hospitalized at Azianda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia; and group B, home-quarantined subjects. RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were enrolled: 295 in group A and 213 in group B. Mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 55 ± 15 years; 56% were men. Overall, OD and GD were present in 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51% to 60%) and 63% (95% CI, 59% to 67%) of cases, respectively. In group A, the prevalence of OD and GD was 44% (95% CI, 38% to 50%) and 52% (95% CI, 46% to 58%), respectively. In group B, the prevalence of OD and GD was 72% (95% CI, 65% to 79%) and 79% (95% CI, 73% to 84%), respectively. In the entire cohort, total loss of olfaction and taste was reported in 64% and 60% of cases, respectively. OD and GD occurred as the first symptom in 10% and 11% of cases, respectively; in the remaining cases, they occurred after a mean of 4 ± 3 days following the first symptom. At the time of the questionnaire, complete resolution of OD and GD was reported in 52% and 55% of cases, respectively (mean duration, 9 ± 5 days in both). CONCLUSION: OD and GD are more prevalent in home-quarantined subjects, and they are independently associated with younger age and female gender.","Paderno, Alberto; Schreiber, Alberto; Grammatica, Alberto; Raffetti, Elena; Tomasoni, Michele; Gualtieri, Tommaso; Taboni, Stefano; Zorzi, Silvia; Lombardi, Davide; Deganello, Alberto; Redaelli De Zinis, Luca Oscar; Maroldi, Roberto; Mattavelli, Davide",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,569

Digital seminars with the methodology of simulated conversations with SP, for planned 690 students for the courses ""history taking"", 6th semester, conversations in psychiatry, 8th semester, and in the clinical competence course, 10th semester, were conducted via video conferencing software. The structure is similar to SP-seminars in classroom teaching with a case presentation, a doctor/patient dialogue and a feedback session. In the 6th and 10th semester, the seminars were evaluated anonymously by the students using an online questionnaire. SP were asked by e-mail for their assessment. The lecturers were asked about their experience with the digital seminars by means of qualitative interviews. Results: The survey of students with 92 completed questionnaires indicates a high level of acceptance. Digital teaching with SP was rated ""very good"" by 63% of the students and ""good"" by 37% as an overall mark for the course. The digital implementation is well practicable, the retention and accessibility of all learning goals is rated as given. Conclusion: Digital teaching with SP can be well realized with appropriate preparation. Specific aspects of digital implementation (e.g. role and data protection) must be taken into account. The differentiated evaluation of the surveys will bring further results and deductive questions.","Lenes, Andrea; Klasen, M; Adelt, A; Göretz, U; Proch-Trodler, C; Schenkat, H; Sopka, S",GMS J Med Educ,,569

We wished to determine whether our preoperative frailty screen would predict postoperative loss of independence (LOI). STUDY DESIGN: This single-institutional study included demographic, procedural, and outcomes data from patients 65 years or older who underwent frailty screening before a surgical procedure. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale. The Operative Severity Score was used to categorize procedures. The Hierarchical Condition Category risk-adjustment score, as calculated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was included. LOI was defined as an increase in support outside of the home after discharge. Univariable, multivariable logistic regressions, and adjusted postestimation analyses for predictive probabilities of best fit were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria and LOI was seen in 38 patients (7%). Patients with LOI were older, had a lower BMI, a higher Edmonton Frail Scale score (7 vs 3.0; p < 0.001), and a higher Hierarchical Condition Category score than patients without LOI. Being frail and undergoing a procedure with an Operative Severity Score of 3 or higher was independently associated with an increased risk of LOI. In addition, social dependency, depression, and limited mobility were associated with an increased risk for LOI. On multivariable modeling, frailty status, undergoing an operation with an Operative Severity Score of 3 or higher, and having a Hierarchical Condition Category score &#8805;1 were the most predictive of LOI (odds ratio 12.72; 95% CI, 12.04 to 13.44; p < 0.001). In addition, self-reported depression, weight loss, and limited mobility were associated with a nearly 11-fold increased risk of postoperative LOI. CONCLUSIONS: This study was novel, as it identified clear, generalizable risk factors for LOI. In addition, our findings support the implementation of preoperative assessments to aid in care coordination and provide specific targets for intervention.","Owodunni, Oluwafemi P; Mostales, Joshua C; Qin, Caroline Xu; Gabre-Kidan, Alodia; Magnuson, Thomas; Gearhart, Susan L",J.

METHODS: This single-centre, observational, cross-sectional study included 211 patients with COVID-19 admitted to non-ICU departments who underwent a single transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with poor acoustic window (n=11) were excluded. Clinical, imaging, laboratory and TTE findings were compared in patients with versus without PH (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg) and with versus without RVD (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm or S wave <9.5 cm/s). The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis (median age 62 (IQR 52-74) years, 65.5% men). The prevalence of PH and RVD was 12.0% (24/200) and 14.5% (29/200), respectively. Patients with PH were older and had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and signs of more severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (radiological lung involvement, laboratory findings and oxygenation status) compared with those without PH. Conversely, patients with RVD had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities but no evidence of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without RVD. The presence of PH was associated with a higher rate of in-hospital death or ICU admission (41.7 vs 8.5%, p<0.001), while the presence of RVD was not (17.2 vs 11.7%, p=0.404). CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised non-ICU patients with COVID-19, PH (and not RVD) was associated with signs of more severe COVID-19 and with worse in-hospital clinical outcome.

523946,Understanding “Zoom fatigue”: Theorizing spatial dynamics as third skins in computer-mediated communication,2020,"Abstract To control the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Brazilian local governments have adopted partial lockdown measures in economic sectors, thereby triggering transmission shocks along input?output supply chains. The national internal market and territorial disparities favor the formation of subnational production networks within borders, thus increasing the potential effects of lockdown measures on regional integration production networks. Therefore, this study makes hypothetical simulations of COVID-19 mitigation policy decisions to understand the regional impacts on integration in supply chains, considering both domestic and global value chains. The generalized hypothetical extraction method is applied to a Brazilian interregional input?output model with 68 industries and 27 regions, imputing partial removals on intermediate consumption and final demand. The results suggest that richer subnational areas, mainly S?o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are proportionally more impacted by COVID-19 trade shocks. However, the poorer peripheries are doubly affected, either by the foreign shock, which would damage their economic structure, or by the retraction of the subnational demand from core states. The findings highlight that economic shocks are spatially distributed through different industrial structures, thus stressing the need to avoid ?one size fits all? regional policies to mitigate the potential negative effects on exposed regions.","Sanguinet, Eduardo Rodrigues Alvim Augusto Mussi Atienza Miguel Fochezatto Adelar",Regional Science Policy &amp; Practice,,569

Though disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization by race-ethnicity are large, disparities by income and education have not been studied. Using an index based on preexisting health conditions and age, we estimate disparities in vulnerability to hospitalization from COVID-19 by income, education, and race-ethnicity for U.S. adults. The index uses estimates of health condition and age effects on hospitalization for respiratory distress prior to the pandemic validated on COVID-19 hospitalizations. We find vulnerability arising from preexisting conditions is nearly three times higher for bottom versus top income quartile adults and 60% higher for those with a high-school degree relative to a college degree. Though non-Hispanic Blacks are more vulnerable than non-Hispanic Whites at comparable ages, among all adults the groups are equally vulnerable because non-Hispanic Blacks are younger. Hispanics are the least vulnerable. Results suggest that income and education disparities in hospitalization are likely large and should be examined directly to further understand the unequal impact of the pandemic.","Wiemers, Emily E.; Abrahams, Scott; AlFakhri, Marwa; Hotz, V.

Multivariable analysis indicated that dental periapical abscess acted as an independent predictor for new onset AF (p < 0.01). The CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score in patients with acute dental periapical abscess had moderate predictive value for development of AF, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.76). An increased risk of new onset AF was identified for individuals hospitalized with dental periapical abscess. Careful follow up of patients with severe, acute dental periapical infections is needed for incident AF, as well as investigations of possible mechanisms linking these conditions.","Hassan, Amaar Obaid; Lip, Gregory Y.

593235,Preliminary findings of COVID-19 infection in health workers in Somalia: a reason for concern,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has ignited the urge for repurposing old drugs as candidate antiviral medicines to treat novel challenges of viral infections. Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled open label clinical trial encompassed 75 COVID-19 patients treated with standard of care plus NCS were included as experimental group and 75 COVID-19 patients treated with only standard of care therapy as control group. Survival rate, time to recovery, and side effects were the main endpoints for the assessment of the therapeutic effect and safety of NCS. RESULTS: No significant difference between the two study groups in the incidence of death Vs recovery within 30 days of follow up(p = 1).Median survival time to cure in the NCS addon group was significantly less than controls (5 Vs 7days, Log rank p = 0.005).All the recoveries took place within 20 days in the NCS add on group, which is 10 days shorter than that in the controls (30 days), NCS add on treatment increased the risk of cure by 60% per day compared to control group (adjusted HR = 1.6,p = 0,007) after adjusting for the count of comorbidities. Additionally, two or more comorbidities reduced the risk of cure to 33% (p < 0.001).Male gender increased the risk of cure by 42% (p = 0.046). Older age group decreased the risk of recovery per day to 0.58 and 0.53 for 50–59 and 60+ years of age. Hyypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly reduced the risk of being cured per day to 0.56 (p = 0.003)and 0.65 (p = 0.039) respectively. No significant signals of safety in NCS add on therapy compared to control group. CONCLUSION: adding NCS to the standards of care measures increased the risk of the cure and had shorter time to stay in the hospital compared with controls., male gender increased the risk of cure, while older patients>40 years, HT, and DM decreased the risk of cure. Also, NCS add on therapy was relatively safe; hence, NCS is of clinical benefit for freeing hospital beds for more patients in pandemic crisis.","Abdulamir, Ahmed S.; Gorial, Faiq I.; Saadi, Sattar Jabar; Maulood, Mohammed Fauzi; Hashim, Hashim Ali; Alnuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; abdulrrazaq, Manal K.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121007299?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512959/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102779; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121007299,569

Currently, there are only very few vaccines and therapeutic drugs against COVID-19, and their efficacies are yet to be tested. Drug repurposing aims to explore new applications of approved drugs, which can significantly reduce time and cost compared with de novo drug discovery. In this study, we built a virus-drug dataset, which included 34 viruses, 210 drugs, and 437 confirmed related virus-drug pairs from existing literature. Besides, we developed an Indicator Regularized non-negative Matrix Factorization (IRNMF) method, which introduced the indicator matrix and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition into the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. According to the 5-fold cross-validation on the virus-drug dataset, the performance of IRNMF was better than other methods, and its Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) value was 0.8127. Additionally, we analyzed the case on COVID-19 infection, and our results suggested that the IRNMF algorithm could prioritize unknown virus-drug associations.","Tang, Xianfang; Cai, Lijun; Meng, Yajie; Xu, JunLin; Lu, Changcheng; Yang, Jialiang",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.603615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584672/,569

It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","Shen, Chenguang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhao, Fang; Yang, Yang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Delin; Yang, Minghui; Xing, Li; Wei, Jinli; Xiao, Haixia; Yang, Yan; Qu, Jiuxin; Qing, Ling; Chen, Li; Xu, Zhixiang; Peng, Ling; Li, Yanjie; Zheng, Haixia; Chen, Feng; Huang, Kun; Jiang, Yujing; Liu, Dongjing; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219428/,569
593674,"Characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of uncertainties, mitigation strategies, and underreporting of cases in South Korea, Italy, and Brazil",2020-05-14,"IMPORTANCE: It is important to understand differences in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths by nursing home racial composition and the potential reasons for these differences so that limited resources can be distributed equitably. OBJECTIVE: To describe differences in the number of COVID-19 deaths by nursing home racial composition and examine the factors associated with these differences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of 13 312 nursing homes in the US used the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which contains COVID-19 cases and deaths among nursing home residents as self-reported by nursing homes beginning between January 1, 2020, and May 24, 2020, and ending on September 13, 2020. Data were analyzed from July 28 to December 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Confirmed cases were defined as COVID-19 infection confirmed by a diagnostic laboratory test. Suspected cases were defined as signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19 infection or patient-specific transmission-based precautions for COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deaths associated with COVID-19 among nursing home residents. Death counts were compared by nursing home racial composition, which was measured as the proportion of White residents. RESULTS: Among 13 312 nursing homes included in the study, the overall mean (SD) age of residents was 79.5 (6.7) years. A total of 51 606 COVID-19–associated deaths among residents were reported, with a mean (SD) of 3.9 (8.0) deaths per facility. The mean (SD) number of deaths in nursing homes with the lowest proportion of White residents (quintile 1) vs nursing homes with the highest proportions of White residents (quintile 5) were 5.6 (9.2) and 1.7 (4.8), respectively. Facilities in quintile 1 experienced a mean (SE) of 3.9 (0.2) more deaths than those in quintile 5, representing a 3.3-fold higher number of deaths in quintile 1 compared with quintile 5. Adjustment for the number of certified beds reduced the mean (SE) difference between these 2 nursing home groups to 2.2 (0.2) deaths. Controlling for case mix measures and other nursing home characteristics did not modify this association. Adjustment for county-level COVID-19 prevalence further reduced the mean (SE) difference to 1.0 (0.2) death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, nursing homes with the highest proportions of non-White residents experienced COVID-19 death counts that were 3.3-fold higher than those of facilities with the highest proportions of White residents. These differences were associated with factors such as larger nursing home size and higher infection burden in counties in which nursing homes with high proportions of non-White residents were located. Focusing limited available resources on facilities with high proportions of non-White residents is needed to support nursing homes during potential future outbreaks.","Gorges, Rebecca J.; Konetzka, R.

594637,The Effect of Response Inhibition Training on Risky Decision-Making Task Performance,2020-07-24,"Previously, we demonstrated that a representative M genogroup type strain of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) from rainbow trout grows well in rainbow trout‐derived RTG‐2 cells, but a U genogroup type strain from sockeye salmon has restricted growth, associated with reduced genome replication and mRNA transcription. Here, we analysed further the mechanisms for this growth restriction of U‐type IHNV in RTG‐2 cells, using strategies that assessed differences in viral genes, host immune regulation and phosphorylation. To determine whether the viral glycoprotein (G) or non‐virion (NV) protein was responsible for the growth restriction, four recombinant IHNV viruses were generated in which the G gene of an infectious IHNV clone was replaced by the G gene of U‐ or M‐type IHNV and the NV gene was replaced by NV of U‐ or M‐type IHNV. There was no significant difference in the growth of these recombinants in RTG‐2 cells, indicating that G and NV proteins are not major factors responsible for the differential growth of the U‐ and M‐type strains. Poly I:C pretreatment of RTG‐2 cells suppressed the growth of both U‐ and M‐type IHNV, although the M virus continued to replicate at a reduced level. Both viruses induced type 1 interferon (IFN1) and the IFN1 stimulated gene Mx1, but the expression levels in M‐infected cells were significantly higher than in U‐infected cells and an inhibitor of the IFN1‐inducible protein kinase PKR, 2‐aminopurine (2‐AP), did not affect the growth of U‐ or M‐type IHNV in RTG‐2 cells. These data did not indicate a role for the IFN1 system in the restricted growth of U‐type IHNV in RTG‐2 cells. Prediction of kinase‐specific phosphorylation sites in the viral phosphoprotein (P) using the NetPhosK program revealed differences between U‐ and M‐type P genes at five phosphorylation sites. Pretreatment of RTG‐2 cells with a PKC inhibitor or a p38MAPK inhibitor did not affect the growth of the U‐ and M‐type viruses. However, 100 μm of the casein kinase II (CKII) inhibitor, 5,6‐dichloro‐1‐β‐d‐ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), reduced the titre of the U type 8.3‐fold at 24 h post‐infection. In contrast, 100 μm of the CKII inhibitor reduced the titre of the M type only 1.3‐fold at 48 h post‐infection. Our data suggest that the different growth of U‐ and M‐type IHNV in RTG‐2 cells may be linked to a differential requirement for cellular protein kinases such as CKII for their growth.","Park, J W; Moon, C H; Harmache, A; Wargo, A R; Purcell, M K; Bremont, M; Kurath, G",J Fish Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21241319/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01225.x,569
595167,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on medical waste management: a case study,2021-03-18,"COVID-19 differs substantially between individuals, ranging from mild to severe or even fatal. Heterogeneity in the immune response against SARS-COV-2 likely contributes to this. Therefore, we explored the temporal dynamics of key cellular and soluble mediators of innate and adaptive immune activation in relation to COVID-19 severity and progression. Forty-four patients with a PCR-proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Extensive cellular (leukocytes and T-lymphocyte subsets) and serological immune profiling (cytokines, soluble cell surface molecules, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) was performed at hospital admission and every 3–4 days during hospitalization. Measurements and disease outcome were compared between patients with an unfavorable (IC admission and/or death) and favorable (all others) outcome. Patients with an unfavorable outcome had higher leukocyte numbers at baseline, mostly due to increased neutrophils, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte numbers were reduced. CRP, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF levels were higher at baseline in the unfavorable group, whereas IL-7 levels were lower. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were more frequently absent in the unfavorable group. Longitudinal analysis revealed delayed kinetics of activated CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets in the unfavorable group. Furthermore, whereas CRP, IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF declined in the favorable group, these cytokines declined with delayed kinetics, remained increased, or even increased further in the unfavorable group. Our data indicate a state of increased innate immune activation in COVID19-patients with an unfavorable outcome at hospital admission, which remained over time, as compared with patients with a favorable outcome.","Schrijver, Benjamin; Assmann, Jorn L.

ERAD is necessary to preserve cell integrity since the accumulation of defective proteins results in diseases associated with neurological dysfunction, cancer, and infections. This process involves recognition of misfolded or misassembled proteins that have been translated in association with ER membranes. Recognition of ERAD substrates leads to their extraction through the ER membrane (retrotranslocation or dislocation), ubiquitination, and destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. This review focuses on ERAD and its components as well as how viruses use this process to promote their replication and to avoid the immune response.","Byun, Hyewon; Gou, Yongqiang; Zook, Adam; Lozano, Mary M.; Dudley, Jaquelin P.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071743/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00330,569

598751,Plasma IP-10 and MCP-3 levels are highly associated with disease severity and predict the progression of COVID-19,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Stepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. METHODS: We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. RESULTS: When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","Rennert, Lior; Heo, Moonseong; Litwin, Alain H.; De Gruttola, Victor",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.26.20162297v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766601/,569

Method: Transversal prospective study conducted in two Spanish hospitals. Patients admitted from March 1st to December 31st 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested for markers of hepatitis B (HBsAg, anti-HBc) and C (anti-HCV, HCV RNA) infection. Results: In this period, 4662 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our centers: 56.3% were male, median age was 76 (0-104) years. Data regarding HBV infection was available in 2915 (62.5%) patients; 253 (8.75%) were anti-HBc+ and 11 (0.38%) HBsAg+. From these, 4 patients did not have a previous diagnosis of hepatitis B, 7 received corticosteroids and one received prophylaxis. There was one HBV reactivation. Anti-HCV were available in 2895 (62%) patients; 24 (0.83%) were positive. From these, 13 patients had a previous hepatitis C diagnosis: 10 patients had been treated with SVR, one achieved spontaneous cure and 2 did not receive treatment. From the 11 previously unknown anti-VHC+ patients, 10 had a negative HCV RNA. Overall, only 3 (0.10%) patients tested RNA HCV+. However, none received HCV treatment (2 older than 90 years with comorbidities, 1 died from COVID-19). Conclusion: Screening of hepatitis C infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients seems less useful than expected. The low prevalence of active infection after antiviral treatments and the high age of our population limit the detection of potential candidates for treatment. HBV screening should be aimed to prevent reactivation under immunosuppressive treatments.","Camarero, Judith Gómez; Aranda, Ester Badia; Castro, Raisa Quiñones; Chumillas, Rosa María Saiz; Vega, Laura Alcoba; Ruiz, Sandra Díez; Manero, Noemí Gómez; Campo, Raquel Vinuesa; Plaza, Francisco Jorquera",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570521002508?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508809/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570521002508; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.09.002,569

We investigated whether exposure to 33°C during training would improve endurance performance in temperate conditions and stimulate mitochondrial adaptations. Seventeen endurance‐trained males were randomly assigned to perform a 3‐week training intervention in 18°C (TEMP) or 33°C (HEAT). An incremental test and 30‐min time‐trial preceded by 2‐h low‐intensity cycling were performed in 18°C pre‐ and post‐intervention, along with a resting vastus lateralis microbiopsy. Training was matched for relative cardiovascular demand using heart rates measured at the first and second ventilatory thresholds, along with a weekly “best‐effort” interval session. Perceived training load was similar between‐groups, despite lower power outputs during training in HEAT versus TEMP (p < .05). Time‐trial performance improved to a greater extent in HEAT than TEMP (30 ± 13 vs. 16 ± 5 W, N = 7 vs. N = 6, p = .04), and citrate synthase activity increased in HEAT (fold‐change, 1.25 ± 0.25, p = .03, N = 9) but not TEMP (1.10 ± 0.22, p = .22, N = 7).

This study examined the possible association between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the ABO phenotype in Black Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report is from a single centre where both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were quarantined. At the time of this report, Oyo State, Nigeria had carried out 15 733 tests of which 3119 were positive for the virus with 1952 recoveries and 37 deaths. The ABO distribution of patients was compared with that of a blood donor population. RESULTS: Of the 302 participants, 297 (98%) had their blood group determined, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals were 123 (40·7%) and 179 (59·3%) respectively. Blood group O was significantly less represented among the patients (P < 0·01) while blood groups B and AB were significantly more represented (P < 0·01, P = 0·03 respectively). Patients with anti‐B (groups A and O) were significantly less represented than those without anti‐B (B and/or AB): B and AB (P < 0·001), B (P = 0·002), AB (P = 0·01). There was no difference in the blood group distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (χ(2) (3, N = 302) = 2·29; P = 0·51), but symptomatic patients with anti‐A (groups B and O) were more represented than asymptomatic patients with anti‐A (χ(2) 4·89; P = 0·03). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of blood group O and more potent beta haemolysins (anti‐B antibodies) are likely reasons for the lower infectivity by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and severity of COVID‐19 disease in the community.","Kotila, Taiwo R.; Alonge, Temitope O.; Fowotade, Adeola; Famuyiwa, Olufisayo I.; Akinbile, Adebola S.",Vox Sang,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529391/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13077,569

METHODS: In this exploratory, qualitative study, 10 emergency nurses from a regional hospital in Hong Kong were recruited using purposive sampling. Semi-structured, face-to-face individual interviews were conducted. Qualitative content analysis was utilized to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: The three following categories emerged from the interview data: concerns about health, comments on the administration, and attitudes of professionalism. Nurses viewed the human swine influenza as a threat to their personal and families’ health. However, nurses perceived that the severity of the disease was exaggerated by the public. Improvements in planning the circulation of information, allocation of manpower, and utilization of personal protective equipment were indicated. The emergency nurses demonstrated a sense of commitment and professional morale in promoting a high quality of nursing care. DISCUSSION: Various factors affecting the perceptions of emergency nurses toward their professional duties during the influenza pandemic were identified. By understanding these perceptions, appropriate planning, policies, and guidelines can be formulated to meet the healthcare needs of patients during future pandemic outbreaks.","Lam, Kam Ki; Hung, Shuk Yu Maria",Int Emerg Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755599X12001000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2012.08.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755599X12001000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142054/,569

MA3MPO was synthesized from 2-amino-3-methylpyridine by several steps to form colorless crystals suitable for crystallographic analysis. The data reveal that MA3MPO crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n. The studied compound contains a nearly flat triply substituted pyridine skeleton whose structure is stabilized by an intramolecular N–H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bond. The N-oxide molecules are connected together by weak C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, an acceptor of which is the oxygen atom from the N-oxide group. This leads to creation of two-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds. Its IR, Raman, UV–Vis and luminescence spectra have been measured and analyzed on the basis of DFT and NBO quantum chemical calculations in which the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) approach was applied. The distribution of the electron levels in the studied compound has been analyzed in terms of the possibility of its participation in the ligand-to-lanthanide ion energy transfer.","Bryndal, I.; Lorenc, J.; Macalik, L.; Michalski, J.; Sąsiadek, W.; Lis, T.; Hanuza, J.",Journal of Molecular Structure,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286019306283; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2019.05.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336784/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286019306283,569

Chest CT is considered an effective tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19. For faster examination, automatic COVID-19 diagnostic techniques using deep learning on CT images have received increasing attention. However, the number and category of existing datasets for COVID-19 diagnosis that can be used for training are limited, and the number of initial COVID-19 samples is much smaller than the normal’s, which leads to the problem of class imbalance. It makes the classification algorithms difficult to learn the discriminative boundaries since the data of some classes are rich while others are scarce. Therefore, training robust deep neural networks with imbalanced data is a fundamental challenging but important task in the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we create a challenging clinical dataset (named COVID19-Diag) with category diversity and propose a novel imbalanced data classification method using deep supervised learning with a self-adaptive auxiliary loss (DSN-SAAL) for COVID-19 diagnosis. The loss function considers both the effects of data overlap between CT slices and possible noisy labels in clinical datasets on a multi-scale, deep supervised network framework by integrating the effective number of samples and a weighting regularization item. The learning process jointly and automatically optimizes all parameters over the deep supervised network, making our model generally applicable to a wide range of datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted on COVID19-Diag and three public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets. The results show that our DSN-SAAL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is effective for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in varying degrees of data imbalance.","Hu, Kai; Huang, Yingjie; Huang, Wei; Tan, Hui; Chen, Zhineng; Zhong, Zheng; Li, Xuanya; Zhang, Yuan; Gao, Xieping",Neurocomputing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221009115?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121811/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925231221009115,569

They argue radically enhanced beings will be entitled to greater and more beneficial treatment through an enhanced moral status, or a stronger claim to basic rights. I challenge these claims by first arguing that emerging technologies will likely give the enhanced direct control over their mental states. The lack of control we currently exhibit over our mental lives greatly contributes to our sense of vulnerability. I then argue moral status should be viewed in terms of vulnerability. The enhanced will slowly gain the ability to command their mental states, reducing their vulnerability. These radically enhanced beings will have greater capacities, and possibly an inner life more valuable than our own.

The goal of this study is to compare presenting symptoms, staging, and treatment of head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma during the pandemic with an analogous timeframe one year prior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary academic center of new adult patients evaluated in a head and neck surgical oncology clinic from March -July 2019 (pre-pandemic control) and March - July 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS: During the pandemic, the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed malignancies increased by 5%, while the overall number of new patients decreased (n = 575) compared to the control year (n = 776). For patients with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), median time from referral to initial clinic visit decreased from 11 days (2019) to 8 days (2020) (p = 0.0031). There was no significant difference in total number (p = 0.914) or duration (p = 0.872) of symptoms. During the pandemic, patients were more likely to present with regional nodal metastases (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.846, 95% CI 1.072-3.219, p = 0.028) and more advanced clinical nodal (N) staging (p = 0.011). No significant difference was seen for clinical tumor (T) (p = 0.502) or metastasis (M) staging (p = 0.278). No significant difference in pathologic T (p = 0.665), or N staging (p = 0.907) was found between the two periods.

However, inadequate attention seems to have been paid to the heart when managing COVID-19 in terms of detection, monitoring and treatment. We are of the opinion that these severe patients may have had myocardial injury or acute myocarditis. Signs that supports this opinion is the extremely high myocardial injury markers in severe patients, cardiac arrhythmia and suffer progressive heart failure or unexpected cardiac arrest in recent studies. Some suggestions involved of treatment need to be made. The use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be placed earlier if the pneumonia progresses rapidly, the ejection fraction decreases or there is heart failure. Besides, blood purification treatment including continuous kidney substitution treatment (CRRT) is recommended to clear inflammatory factors and block cytokine storm.

616732,Case Study Comparison: Limitations in Telehealth Relating to Poverty and Family Support,2021,"BACKGROUND: Public health emergencies like epidemics put enormous pressure on health care systems while revealing deep structural and functional problems in the organization of care. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways. These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an innovative web-based solution addressing the seemingly insurmountable challenges of triaging, monitoring, and delivering nonhospital services unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An adaptable crisis management digital platform was envisioned and designed with the goal of improving the system’s response on the basis of the literature; an existing shared health record platform; and discussions between health care providers, decision makers, academia, and the private sector in response to the COVID 19 epidemic. RESULTS: The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in Ontario on a nonprofit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of nonhospital services. It decentralizes the provision of services (by moving them online) and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing the use of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scale-up possibilities (only constrained by human health risk resource availability) with minimal marginal cost. Similar web-based solutions have the potential to fill an urgent gap in resource allocation, becoming a unique asset for health systems governance and management during critical times. They highlight the potential effectiveness of web-based solutions if built on an outcome-driven architecture. CONCLUSIONS: Data and web-based approaches in response to a public health crisis are key to evidence-driven oversight and management of public health emergencies.","Krausz, Michael; Westenberg, Jean Nicolas; Vigo, Daniel; Spence, Richard Trafford; Ramsey, Damon",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401218/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18995,569

METHODS: The data were obtained from a health system with 19 emergency departments in northeast Ohio in the United States. Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression. RESULTS: Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8–13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4–10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60–0.28).

Here we analyze, at the single cell level, plasmablasts egressed into the blood to study the dynamics of adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. Before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, peripheral plasmablasts display a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature; however, following seroconversion, plasmablasts lose this signature, express instead gene signatures induced by IL-21 and TGF-β, and produce mostly IgG1 and IgA1. In the sustained immune reaction from COVID-19 patients, plasmablasts shift to the expression of IgA2, thereby reflecting an instruction by TGF-β. Despite their continued presence in the blood, plasmablasts are not found in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients, nor does patient IgA2 binds to the dominant antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Our results thus suggest that, in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a chronic immune reaction that is instructed by TGF-β, and is distracted from itself.","Ferreira-Gomes, Marta; Kruglov, Andrey; Durek, Pawel; Heinrich, Frederik; Tizian, Caroline; Heinz, Gitta Anne; Pascual-Reguant, Anna; Du, Weijie; Mothes, Ronja; Fan, Chaofan; Frischbutter, Stefan; Habenicht, Katharina; Budzinski, Lisa; Ninnemann, Justus; Jani, Peter K.; Guerra, Gabriela Maria; Lehmann, Katrin; Matz, Mareen; Ostendorf, Lennard; Heiberger, Lukas; Chang, Hyun-Dong; Bauherr, Sandy; Maurer, Marcus; Schönrich, Günther; Raftery, Martin; Kallinich, Tilmann; Mall, Marcus Alexander; Angermair, Stefan; Treskatsch, Sascha; Dörner, Thomas; Corman, Victor Max; Diefenbach, Andreas; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Winkler, Thomas H.; Dong, Jun; Hauser, Anja Erika; Radbruch, Helena; Witkowski, Mario; Melchers, Fritz; Radbruch, Andreas; Mashreghi, Mir-Farzin",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785765/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22210-3,569

In the study, 117 complete spike gene sequences of Thai PED virus (PEDV) collected from 2008 to 2015 were clustered along with 95 references of PEDV spike sequences, and analyzed with the US sequences dataset (n = 99). The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Thai PEDV spike sequences were genetically diverse and had been influenced by multiple introduction of exotic strains. Although Thai PEDV have been evolved into 6 subgroups (TH1–6), Subgroup TH1 strains with the unique 9 nucleotides (CAA GGG AAT) insertion between 688th–689th position of spike (changing amino acid from N to TREY) insertion has become the dominant subgroup since 2014. Thai PEDV spike gene have higher evolutionary rate compare to that of the US sequences. One contributing factor would be the intra-recombination between subgroups. Thailand endemic strain should be assigned into new subclade of G2 (Thai pandemic variant).","Stott, Christopher J.; Temeeyasen, Gun; Tripipat, Thitima; Kaewprommal, Pavita; Tantituvanont, Angkana; Piriyapongsa, Jittima; Nilubol, Dachrit",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28235643/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134817300679; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.02.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817300679,569
625078,Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the patterns of vital signs recording and staff compliance with expected monitoring schedules on general wards,2020-11-19,"Traumatic brain injury is associated with coagulopathy that increases mortality risk. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thromboelastography (Haemonetics SA, Signy, Switzerland) provide rapid coagulopathy assessment and may be particularly useful for goal-directed treatment of traumatic brain injury patients. We conducted a systematic review to assess thromboelastography in the evaluation and management of coagulopathy in traumatic brain injury patients. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, and CENTRAL. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies of adult patients with traumatic brain injury (isolated or polytrauma) who were assessed by either standard thromboelastography or thromboelastography with platelet mapping plus either conventional coagulation assays or platelet function assays from January 1999 to June 2021. DATA EXTRACTION: Demographics, injury mechanism and severity, diagnostic, laboratory data, therapies, and outcome data were extracted for analysis and comparison. DATA SYNTHESIS: Database search revealed 1,169 sources; eight additional articles were identified by the authors. After review, 31 publications were used for qualitative analysis, and of these, 16 were used for quantitative analysis. Qualitative and quantitative analysis found unique patterns of thromboelastography and thromboelastography with platelet mapping parameters in traumatic brain injury patients. Patterns were distinct compared with healthy controls, nontraumatic brain injury trauma patients, and traumatic brain injury subpopulations including those with severe traumatic brain injury or penetrating traumatic brain injury. Abnormal thromboelastography K-time and adenosine diphosphate % inhibition on thromboelastography with platelet mapping are associated with decreased survival after traumatic brain injury. Subgroup meta-analysis of severe traumatic brain injury patients from two randomized controlled trials demonstrated improved survival when using a viscoelastic hemostatic assay-guided resuscitation strategy (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17–0.91; p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Thromboelastography and thromboelastography with platelet mapping characterize coagulopathy patterns in traumatic brain injury patients. Abnormal thromboelastography profiles are associated with poor outcomes. Conversely, treatment protocols designed to normalize abnormal parameters may be associated with improved traumatic brain injury patient outcomes. Current quality of evidence in this population is low; so future efforts should evaluate viscoelastic hemostatic assay-guided hemostatic resuscitation in larger numbers of traumatic brain injury patients with specific focus on those with traumatic brain injury-associated coagulopathy.","Cannon, Jeremy W.; Dias, João D.; Kumar, Monisha A.; Walsh, Mark; Thomas, Scott G.; Cotton, Bryan A.; Schuster, James M.; Evans, Susan L.; Schreiber, Martin A.; Adam, Elisabeth H.; Zacharowski, Kai; Hartmann, Jan; Schöchl, Herbert; Kaplan, Lewis J.",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549189/,569
625619,Transport and mobility justice: Evolving discussions,2020-07-14,"INTRODUCTION: We have demonstrated in a multicenter cohort that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) among stroke patients. Whether this delay contributes to meaningful short-term outcome differences in these patients warranted further exploration. METHODS: We conducted a nested observational cohort study of adult acute ischemic stroke patients receiving IVT from 9 comprehensive stroke centers across 7 U.S states. Patients admitted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1/1/2019–02/29/2020) were compared to patients admitted during the early pandemic (3/1/2020–7/31/2020). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of IVT delay on discharge to hospice or death, with treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 included as an interaction term. RESULTS: Of the 676 thrombolysed patients, the median age was 70 (IQR 58–81) years, 313 were female (46.3%), and the median NIHSS was 8 (IQR 4–16). Longer treatment delays were observed during COVID-19 (median 46 vs 38 min, p = 0.01) and were associated with higher in-hospital death/hospice discharge irrespective of admission period (OR per hour 1.08, 95% CI 1.01–1.17, p = 0.03). This effect was strengthened after multivariable adjustment (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07–1.24, p < 0.001). There was no interaction of treatment delay on admission during COVID-19 (p(interaction) = 0.65). Every one-hour delay in IVT was also associated with 7% lower odds of being discharged to home or acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.97, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Treatment delays observed during the COVID-19 pandemic led to greater early mortality and hospice care, with a lower probability of discharge to home/rehabilitation facility. There was no effect modification of treatment delay on admission during the pandemic, indicating that treatment delay at any time contributes similarly to these short-term outcomes.","Jillella, Dinesh V.; Nahab, Fadi; Nguyen, Thanh N.; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Liebeskind, David S.; Vora, Nirav; Rai, Vivek; Haussen, Diogo C.; Nogueira, Raul G.; Desai, Shashvat; Jadhav, Ashutosh P.; Czap, Alexandra L.; Zha, Alicia M.; Linfante, Italo; Hassan, Ameer E; Quispe-Orozco, Darko; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Khandelwal, Priyank; Patel, Pratit; Zaidat, Osama; Jovin, Tudor G.; Kamen, Scott; Siegler, James E.",J Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34333701/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10734-z,569
626085,"Alone, Together: Social Isolation, Quarantine, and the Coronavirus Pandemic",2020-06-28,"Thermoregulation is a complex, dynamic process involving coordination between multiple autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral mechanisms. In the context of infection, this intricate machinery generates fever, a process believed to serve vital functions in the body's defense against pathogens. In addition to increasing core temperature, infection can lead to changes in the dynamic fluctuations in body temperature over time. The patterns of these deviations may convey information about the health of the body and the course of illness. Here, we utilized dynamic structural equation modeling to explore patterns of body temperature change following an experimental respiratory virus challenge in an aggregated, archival dataset of human participants (N = 1,412). We also examined whether temperature dynamics during infection were related to symptom severity, as well as individual differences in biomarkers of inflammation and stress. We found that individuals meeting the criteria for infection exhibited higher but less stable body temperatures over time compared to those not meeting criteria of infection. While temperature parameters did not reliably predict symptom severity, higher levels of nasal proinflammatory cytokines were associated with lower, more consistent temperatures during the study period. Further, levels of salivary cortisol and urinary catecholamines measured at the beginning of the study appeared to have disparate effects on temperature change. In sum, this research highlights the utility of dynamic time series modeling as a framework for studying body temperature change and lends novel insights into how stress may interact with infection to influence patterns of thermoregulation.","Gassen, Jeffrey; Nowak, Tomasz J; Henderson, Alexandria D; Muehlenbein, Michael P",Brain behav. immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34624484/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.10.001,569

We aimed to evaluate the values of routine fecal occult blood (FOB) test and urinary cytology test (UCT) for screening of GI and UI in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, COVID‐19 patients without associated comorbidities were divided into FOB‐ or UCT‐positive or FOB‐ or UCT‐negative groups. Their clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 13.6% of patients (47 of 345) tested positive for FOB, and 57.4% (27 of 47) of these patients lacked gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 30.1% of patients (104 of 345) exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms, and 38.0% (131 of 345) were positive for either FOB or gastrointestinal symptoms. FOB‐positive patients possessed significantly higher levels of C‐reactive protein and fewer lymphocytes than FOB‐negative patients. A total of 36.9% of patients (80 of 217) exhibited positive UCT, and 97.5% (78 of 80) of these patients possessed normal levels of serum markers for renal injuries. Significant differences in age and sex ratios were observed between the UCT‐positive and UCT‐negative groups, and 72.4% (42 of 58) of female patients over 60 years old were UCT‐positive. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal occult blood test in combination with gastrointestinal symptoms could serve as a simple and useful screening approach for GI diagnoses for COVID‐19. Age and sex are risk factors for UI in COVID‐19 patients. UCT could be a sensitive tool for assessing early UI at a stage in which serum markers for renal injuries appear normal.","Du, Li; Cao, Xiaoling; Chen, Jing; Wei, Xiuqi; Zeng, Yi; Cheng, Chen; Lin, Yuqi; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063366/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23626,569
627202,Challenges to COVID-19 vaccine supply chain: Implications for sustainable development goals,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is a widespread pathogen in European aquaculture of salmonid fish. Distinct viral subtypes have been suggested based on sequence comparisons and some of these have different geographical distributions. In Norway, only SAV subtype 3 have so far been identified. Little is known about viral mechanisms important for pathogenesis and transmission. Tools for detailed exploration of SAV genomes are therefore needed. RESULTS: Infectious cDNA clones in which a genome of subtype 3 SAV is under the control of a CMV promoter were constructed. The clones were designed to express proteins that are putatively identical to those previously reported for the SAVH20/03 strain. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a part of the E2 glycoprotein in order to detect expression of the subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural viral proteins. Transfection of the cDNA clone revealed the expression of the E2 protein by IFAT, and in serial passages of the supernatant the presence of infectious recombinant virus was confirmed through RT-PCR, IFAT and the development of a cytopathic effect similar to that seen during infection with wild type SAV. Confirmation that the recovered virus originated from the infectious plasmid was done by sequence identification of an introduced genetic tag. The recombinant virus was infectious also when an additional ORF encoding an EGFP reporter gene under the control of a second subgenomic alphavirus promoter was added. Finally, we used the system to study the effect of selected point mutations on infectivity in Chinook salmon embryo cells. While introduced mutations in nsP2(197), nsP3(263 )and nsP3(323 )severely reduced infectivity, a serine to proline mutation in E2(206 )appeared to enhance the virus titer production. CONCLUSION: We have constructed infectious clones for SAV based on a subtype 3 genome. The clones may serve as a platform for further functional studies.","Karlsen, Marius; Villoing, Stephane; Ottem, Karl F; Rimstad, Espen; Nylund, Are",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858233/,569

We sought to explore if novel ways to utilize teleICU services can emerge within an established, consulting-style teleICU model considering the program’s flexible, provider-driven operation. METHODS: This was a qualitative study of one teleICU/hospital dyad using semi-structured interviews from a convenience sample of ICU (n = 19) and teleICU (n = 13) nurses. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis to identify themes that describe their experiences with teleICU using a deductive codebook developed from an expert consensus (American Association of Critical Care Nurses) AACN statement on teleICU nursing. RESULTS: Three themes were identified through the qualitative content analysis: [1] nurses described unique teleICU knowledge, including systems thinking and technological skills, [2] the teleICU partnership supported quality improvement initiatives, and [3] elements of the work environment influenced perceptions of teleICU and its use. When elements of the work environment, such as effective communication and role clarity, were not present, teleICU use was variable. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible, provider-driven approaches for integrating teleICU services into daily practice may help define the future use of the teleICU model’s applicability. Future work should focus on the importance of effective communication and role clarity in integrating the emerging teleICU services into teleICU/ICU practice.

At the beginning of the epidemic, much attention is paid to person-to-person transmission, disinfection of virus-contaminated surfaces, and social distancing. However, there is much debate about the routes of disease transmission, including airborne transmission, so it is important to elucidate the exact route of transmission of the COVID-19 disease. To this end, the first systematic review study was conducted to comprehensively search all databases to collect studies on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor air environments. In total, 14 relevant and eligible studies were included. Based on the findings, there is a great possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor air environments. Therefore, some procedures are presented such as improving ventilation, especially in hospitals and crowded places, and observing the interpersonal distance of more than 2 meters so that experts in indoor air quality consider them to improve the indoor air environments. Finally, in addition to the recommendations of the centers and official authorities such as hand washing and observing social distancing, the route of air transmission should also be considered to further protect health personnel, patients in hospitals, and the public in other Public Buildings.","Noorimotlagh, Zahra; Jaafarzadeh, Neemat; Martínez, Susana Silva; Mirzaee, Seyyed Abbas",Environ Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309820/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120315097?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120315097,569

Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice of preventive measures by the risk group of Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus patients will prevent them from getting infected by COVID-19 and at the same time decrease mortality rates and hence the undiscovered group that is the patients of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus needs to be vigilant regarding safe preventive practices.","John, Jyoti Elgiva; John, Nitin Ashok",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.36.158.24011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32874422/,569

A central tenet of our current understanding of this persistence is that infected cells are shielded from immune recognition and elimination through a lack of antigen expression from proviruses. Efforts to cure HIV infection have therefore focused on reactivating latent proviruses to enable immune-mediated clearance, but these have yet to succeed in reducing viral reservoirs. Here, we revisited the question of whether HIV reservoirs are predominately immunologically silent from a new angle: by querying the dynamics of HIV-specific T cell responses over long-term ART for evidence of ongoing recognition of HIV-infected cells. In longitudinal assessments, we show that the rates of change in persisting HIV Nef-specific responses, but not responses to other HIV gene products, were associated with residual frequencies of infected cells. These Nef-specific responses were highly stable over time and disproportionately exhibited a cytotoxic, effector functional profile, indicative of recent in vivo recognition of HIV antigens. These results indicate substantial visibility of the HIV-infected cells to T cells on stable ART, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the development of therapeutic approaches to curing infection.","Stevenson, Eva M.; Ward, Adam R.; Truong, Ronald; Thomas, Allison S.; Huang, Szu-Han; Dilling, Thomas R.; Terry, Sandra; Bui, John K.; Mota, Talia M.; Danesh, Ali; Lee, Guinevere Q.; Gramatica, Andrea; Khadka, Pragya; Alberto, Winiffer D.

However, inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease, limits an understanding of disease inception. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of alveolar epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture. We find a rapid transcriptomic change in infected cells, characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype with upregulation of NF-kB signaling and loss of the mature alveolar program. Drug testing confirms the efficacy of remdesivir as well as TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in alveolar cells. Our model system reveals cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to SARS-CoV-2 infection and should facilitate drug development.","Huang, Jessie; Hume, Adam J.; Abo, Kristine M.; Werder, Rhiannon B.; Villacorta-Martin, Carlos; Alysandratos, Konstantinos-Dionysios; Beermann, Mary Lou; Simone-Roach, Chantelle; Lindstrom-Vautrin, Jonathan; Olejnik, Judith; Suder, Ellen L.; Bullitt, Esther; Hinds, Anne; Sharma, Arjun; Bosmann, Markus; Wang, Ruobing; Hawkins, Finn; Burks, Eric J.; Saeed, Mohsan; Wilson, Andrew A.; Mühlberger, Elke; Kotton, Darrell N.",Cell Stem Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32979316/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1934590920304598; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.09.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590920304598?v=s5,569

Participants with high stress during the pandemic were at higher risk of symptoms of depression [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.43–1.95, p < 0.01), anxiety (adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.63–2.23, p < 0.01), insomnia (adjusted OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.44–1.87, p < 0.01), PTSD (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.38–2.11, p < 0.01) and suicidal behavior (adjusted OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 2.28–5.40, p < 0.01). Distant relationship with parents, changes in lifestyle and alcohol use during the pandemic were associated with higher risk of mental health symptoms and suicidal behavior, whereas regular physical exercise reduced the risk of mental health problems. Conclusions: The psychological symptoms and suicidal behavior were relatively high among students who attended university in Wuhan, China after 6 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Comprehensive mental health services and suicide prevention strategies are essential for university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Yingying; Su, Sizhen; Jiang, Zhendong; Guo, Suihuai; Lu, Qingdong; Liu, Lin; Zhao, Yimiao; Wu, Ping; Que, Jianyu; Shi, Le; Deng, Jiahui; Meng, Shiqiu; Yan, Wei; Sun, Yankun; Yuan, Kai; Lin, Xiao; Sun, Siwei; Ravindran, Arun V.; Chen, Sijing; Wing, Yun Kwok; Tang, Xiangdong; Ran, Maosheng; Lu, Yu; Shi, Jie; Huang, Guofu; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326787/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.695017,569
632145,Impacts of COVID-19 on global tourism industry: A cross-regional comparison,2020-09-06,"Introduction Respiratory infections after HCT lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs due to pulmonary complications. In up to a third of patients following allogeneic HCT, infection can progress from an upper to a lower respiratory tract infection. Without vaccines or effective therapeutics for most viruses, very little can be done beyond supportive care. Objectives There is a need to identify risk factors for virus acquisition in HCT recipients in order to develop and implement better preventative interventions. Methods In a prospective study, 471 HCT patients enrolled between 2005 and 2010 underwent weekly PCR-based surveillance for RSV, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-4, influenza A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. Detailed weekly surveys were collected from subjects for up to 1 year post-transplant on symptoms and exposures to children under 10 years or sick contacts (within 3 feet for more than 1 hour total in the past week). We performed multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify risk factors associated with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection by PCR (asymptomatic and symptomatic) within the first 100 days HCT. Results In this cohort, 211 patients (45%) acquired a respiratory virus in the first 100 days after transplant. Of those infected, 88 (42%) were symptomatic with at least 2 respiratory symptoms. We found significantly higher risk of acquiring any respiratory viral infection for patients with underlying chronic leukemia compared with other hematologic malignancies [hazard ratio (HR) 1.79 (1.16 – 2.77)], exposure to children under or over 4 years [HR 1.84 (1.36 – 2.48)], exposure to contacts with cold symptoms [HR 1.47 (1.02 – 2.12)], exposure to systemic steroids [HR 1.49 (1.07 – 2.08)], and absolute monocyte counts < 100/µL [HR 1.81 (1.12 – 2.94)]. Age, age of child exposure, gender, smoking history, season, conditioning regimen, donor relationship, cell source, presence of acute GVHD, albumin level, total IgG level, lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil counts were not associated with risk for acquisition. We also analyzed the association of these same variables with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection with symptomatic respiratory disease. We found that exposure to children [HR 1.56 (1.03 – 2.35)] and exposure to steroids [HR 1.59 (1.01 – 2.52)] remained associated with acquisition of symptomatic respiratory viral infection. Conclusions These data support the contribution of both exposure and immunologic determinants to the risk of respiratory viral acquisition with and without development of symptoms. Although many infections were asymptomatic, patients receiving steroids and those in close proximity to children may benefit from closer monitoring and counseling in the early post-transplant period.","Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Xie, Hu; Waghmare, Alpana; Campbell, Angela P; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Davis, Chris; Kuypers, Jane M; Chien, Jason; Pergam, Steven A.; Liu, Catherine; Callais, Cheryl; Jerome, Keith R; Leisenring, Wendy M; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael J",Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879118313831; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879118313831,569
633916,Introduction to the special issue “SIR Model and Macroeconomics of COVID-19”,2021-09-03,"BACKGROUND: An unusual feature of SARS-Cov-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic is that children are less severely affected than adults. This is especially paradoxical given the epidemiological links between poor air quality and increased COVID-19 severity in adults and that children are generally more vulnerable than adults to the adverse consequences of air pollution. OBJECTIVES: To identify gaps in knowledge about the factors that protect children from severe SARS-Cov-2 infection even in the face of air pollution, and to develop a transdisciplinary research strategy to address these gaps. METHODS: An international group of researchers interested in children’s environmental health was invited to identify knowledge gaps and to develop research questions to close these gaps. DISCUSSION: Key research questions identified include: what are the effects of SAR-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy on the developing fetus and child; what is the impact of age at infection and genetic susceptibility on disease severity; why do some children with COVID-19 infection develop toxic shock and Kawasaki-like symptoms; what are the impacts of toxic environmental exposures including poor air quality, chemical and metal exposures on innate immunity, especially in the respiratory epithelium; what is the possible role of a “dirty” environment in conveying protection – an example of the “hygiene hypothesis”; and what are the long term health effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection in early life. CONCLUSION: A concerted research effort by a multidisciplinary team of scientists is needed to understand the links between environmental exposures, especially air pollution and COVID-19. We call for specific research funding to encourage basic and clinical research to understand if/why exposure to environmental factors is associated with more severe disease, why children appear to be protected, and how innate immune responses may be involved. Lessons learned about SARS-Cov-2 infection in our children will help us to understand and reduce disease severity in adults, the opposite of the usual scenario.","Sly, Peter D.; Trottier, Brittany A.; Bulka, Catherine M.; Cormier, Stephania A.; Fobil, Julius; Fry, Rebecca C.; Kim, Kyoung-Woong; Kleeberger, Steven; Kumar, Pushpam; Landrigan, Philip J.; Lodrop Carlsen, Karin C.; Pascale, Antonio; Polack, Fernando; Ruchirawat, Mathuros; Zar, Heather J.; Suk, William A.",Environ Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-021-00716-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771185/,569

Due to the sudden onset of the pandemic, physicians have by necessity made such important clinical decisions in the absence of robust evidence or consistent guidelines. The risk to patients is compounded by the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in this population, which alongside diabetes is a major risk factor for severe disease and mortality in Covid-19. We convened as experts from the Central and Eastern European region to consider what advice we can provide in the setting of type 2 diabetes and Covid-19, considering the evidence before, during and after infection. We review recommendations that have been published to date, and consider the best available—but currently limited—evidence from large observational studies and the DARE-19 randomized control trial. Notably, we find a lack of guidance on restarting patients on optimal antidiabetic therapy after recovering from Covid-19, and suggest that this may provide an opportunity to optimize treatment and counter clinical inertia that predates the pandemic. Furthermore, we emphasize that optimization applies not only to glycaemic control, but other factors such as cardiorenal protection. While we look forward to the emergence of new evidence that we hope will address these gaps, in the interim we provide a perspective, based on our collective clinical experience, on how best to manage glucose-lowering therapy as patients with Covid-19 recover from their disease and return to normal care.","Czupryniak, Leszek; Dicker, Dror; Lehmann, Roger; Prázný, Martin; Schernthaner, Guntram",Cardiovasc Diabetol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34598700/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01389-1,569

Here we find that murine lung tumors from the Kras(LSL‐G12D/+); Lkb1(flox/flox) (KL) model show strong plasticity, which associates with up‐regulation of stem cell pluripotency genes such as Nanog. Deletion of Nanog in KL model initiates a gastric differentiation program and promotes mucinous lung tumor growth. We find that NANOG is not expressed at a meaningful level in human lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), as well as in human lung invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA). Gastric differentiation involves activation of Notch signaling, and perturbation of Notch pathway by the γ‐secretase inhibitor LY‐411575 remarkably impairs mucinous tumor formation. In contrast to non‐mucinous tumors, mucinous tumors are resistant to phenformin treatment. Such therapeutic resistance could be overcome through combined treatments with LY‐411575 and phenformin. Overall, we uncover a previously unappreciated plasticity of LKB1‐deficient tumors and identify the Nanog‐Notch axis in regulating gastric differentiation, which holds important therapeutic implication for the treatment of mucinous lung cancer.","Tong, Xinyuan; Chen, Yueqing; Zhu, Xinsheng; Ye, Yi; Xue, Yun; Wang, Rui; Gao, Yijun; Zhang, Wenjing; Gao, Weiqiang; Xiao, Lei; Chen, Haiquan; Zhang, Peng; Ji, Hongbin",EMBO Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439550/; https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202012627,569

A wide variety of microbial systems are continuously subjected to mutations which ultimately results in antimicrobial resistance. The present study aimed at the fabrication of a nano drug delivery system which simultaneously is superparamagnetic, fluorescent, non-cytotoxic and antifungal. The developed system is an easily targetable and detectable tool owing to its superparamagnetic and fluorescent characteristics respectively. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized by macromolecular starch have been incorporated into a fluorescently modified carrier system to get the final drug delivery system. The finally developed drug carrier system is found to be non-cytotoxic from the in vitro cytotoxicity studies performed against normal rat spleen cells. The photodynamic antifungal capability of the system was the premier concern of investigation of the present study. The antifungal studies were conducted against Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichophyton rubrum by well diffusion method and the results were compared with the activity of the antibiotic, griseofulvin. The minimum inhibitory concentration against each fungal strain was determined using broth dilution method.

This study aimed to investigate Danish endocrinologists’ use of thyroid hormones in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients. METHODS: An e-mail with an invitation to participate in an online survey investigating practices about substitution with thyroid hormones was sent to all members of the Danish Endocrine Society (DES). RESULTS: Out of 488 eligible DES members, a total of 152 (31.2%) respondents were included in the analysis. The majority (94.1%) of responding DES members use LT4 as the treatment of choice. Other treatment options for hypothyroidism are also used, as 58.6% prescribe combination therapy with liothyronine (LT3) + LT4 in their clinical practice. LT4 + LT3 combination is preferred in patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite biochemical euthyroidism on LT4 treatment. Over half of the respondents answered that thyroid hormone therapy is never indicated for euthyroid patients, but 42.1% will consider it for euthyroid infertile women with high antibody levels. In various conditions that could interfere with the absorption of LT4, most responding Danish endocrinologists prefer tablets and do not expect a significant difference when switching from one type of tablet formulation to another. CONCLUSION: The treatment of choice for hypothyroidism is LT4. Combination therapy with LT4 + LT3 is considered for patients with persistent symptoms. Even in the presence of conditions affecting bioavailability, responding Danish endocrinologists prefer LT4 tablets rather than newer LT4 formulations, such as soft-gel capsules.

636226,Data analytics to evaluate the impact of infectious disease on economy: Case study of COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-27,"N-linked glycosylation is one of the most abundant posttranslational modifications of membrane-bound proteins in eukaryotes and affects a number of biological activities, including protein biosynthesis, protein stability, intracellular trafficking, subcellular localization, and ligand-receptor interaction. Accumulating evidence indicates that cell membrane immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), are glycosylated with heavy N-linked glycan moieties in human cancers. N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 maintains its protein stability and interaction with its cognate receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and this in turn promotes evasion of T-cell immunity. Studies have suggested targeting PD-L1 glycosylation as a therapeutic option by rational combination of cancer immunotherapies. Interestingly, structural hindrance by N-glycan on PD-L1 in fixed samples impedes its recognition by PD-L1 diagnostic antibodies. Notably, the removal of N-linked glycosylation enhances PD-L1 detection in a variety of bioassays and more accurately predicts the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting an important clinical implication of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation. A detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms, cellular functions, and diagnostic limits underlying PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation could shed new light on the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment and deepen our knowledge of biomarkers to identify patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. In this review, we highlight the effects of protein glycosylation on cancer immunotherapy using N-linked glycosylation of PD-L1 as an example. In addition, we consider the potential impacts of PD-L1 N-linked glycosylation on clinical diagnosis. The notion of utilizing the deglycosylated form of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker to guide anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is also discussed.","Wang, Ying-Nai; Lee, Heng-Huan; Hsu, Jennifer L.; Yu, Dihua; Hung, Mien-Chie",J Biomed Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-020-00670-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620165/,569

As soon as the virus emerged, scientists and researchers from all over the world started investigating the dynamics of this disease. Despite extensive investments in research, no cure has been officially found to date. This uncertain situation rises severe threats to the survival of mankind. An ultimate need of the time is to investigate the course of disease transfer and suggest a future projection of the disease transfer to be enabled to effectively tackle the always evolving situations ahead. In the present study daily new cases of COVID-19 was predicted using different forecasting techniques; Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing/Error Trend Seasonality (ETS), Artificial Neural Network Models (ANN), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in four countries; Pakistan, USA, India and Brazil. The dataset of new daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the date on which first case was registered in the respective country to 30 November 2020 is analyzed through these five forecasting models to forecast the new daily cases up to 31st January 2020. The forecasting efficiency of each model was evaluated using well known statistical parameters R(2), RMSE, and NSE. A comparative analysis of all above-mentioned models was performed. Finally, the study concluded that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based forecasting model projected the future cases of COVID-19 pandemic best in all the selected four stations. The accuracy of the model ranges from coefficient of determination value of 0.85 in Brazil to 0.96 in Pakistan. NSE value for the model in India is 0. 99, 0.98 in USA and Pakistan and 0.97 in Brazil.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described previously in hospitalized patients mainly. The percentage of patients vulnerable after coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still being under discussion. What remains unknown is the impact of coronary virus on heart on mildly symptomatic patients. Aim of the study The aim of the study was to evaluate cardiac injury 4 months after COVID-19 in mildly symptomatic patients. Material and methods 80 patients successfully cured from COVID-19 were evaluated between 3-4 months after the disease. The study group consisted of 30 males (37.5%) and 50 females (62.5%) with the mean (SD) age 45 (11) years. All patients had laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) done. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed on 1,5T scanner (Aera, Siemens, Germany). During the CMR study cine imagines, T2-mapping, T1-mapping before and after gadolinium, extracellular volume (ECV) assumption and late gadolinium enhancement were done. Additionally global longitudinal strain was examined. Dedicated software (QMass, Medis, Holland) was used. RESULTS: During SARS-CoV-2 infection 31 patients (39%) had comorbidities, 16 patients (20%) were hospitalized for 3-5 days. 64 (80%) recovered at home, from whom 10 (12.5%) were asymptomatic. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin I (hs TnI) was in the normal range in all subjects, while 8 (10%) subjects showed slightly elevated NT pro-BNP and 11 (14%) subjects showed elevated D-dimers. Based on myocardial injury detected during CMR the patients were divided into 2 groups. CMR examination showed myocardial injury in 34 (42.5%) patients. The patients with myocardial injury had significant higher native T1 (1011ms in injured group vs 967ms in group without injury; p = 0.006) and ECV (29.5% vs 27% respectively; p = 0.003). NT pro-BNP levels were elevated in 9 patients with myocardial injury on CMR. None of the patients without myocardial injury had NT pro-BNP elevated (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that even in mildly symptomatic patients there are occurrences of myocardial injury.

Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred. Conclusion: Data from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.","LOFGREN, S. M. M.; Nicol, M.

They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator-associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator-associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head-of-bed elevation ≥30°, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator-associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites. RESULTS: In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator-associated events: 82 ventilator-associated conditions, 15 infection-related ventilator-associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5%-76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2%-72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection-related ventilator-associated conditions (4.2-3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1-1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3%-19.1%, P = .045), and ventilator-associated events associated mortality rates (33.3%-8.3%, P < .37).

Of the 3,025 injuries reported, 582 (19%) occurred during weeks 1-4 of the 2020-2021 regular season, whereas 1,292 (53%) occurred during preseason weeks 1-4, and 1,151 (38%) occurred during regular-season weeks 1-4 of NFL seasons 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020. There was a significant increase in the injury rate during weeks 1-4 of the 2020-2021 regular season for all comparisons with the injury rate both during the preseasons and the regular seasons of 3 recent past NFL seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of injury in NFL players during weeks 1-4 of the 2020-2021 regular seasons was significantly higher than during 3 recent past NFL preseasons and regular seasons.

642555,Phytoplankton bloom detection during the COVID-19 lockdown with remote sensing data: Using Copernicus Sentinel-3 for north-western Arabian/Persian Gulf case study.,2021-07-28,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted life at the US-Mexico border in many ways, including sleep and dietary behavior. Given the potential long-term impact of worsening sleep and metabolic health due to the pandemic, the present study examines whether changes to dietary behavior were associated with changes to sleep. METHODS: Participants were 155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) Study and were contacted about completing a COVID-19 sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants reported the degree to which they experienced pandemic-related changes to sleep, including a more regular schedule, overall improvement, overall worsening, more initial insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more daytime sleepiness, and more napping. They were also asked whether as a result of the pandemic they consumed an overall healthier diet, more homecooked meals, more processed meals, more regular meals, whether they enjoyed food more, and degree of overeating. Ordinal regressions with diet change as outcome and sleep change as predictor were adjusted for age, sex, education, and socioeconomics. RESULTS: Those who reported more regular sleep were more likely to report a healthier overall diet (oOR=3.12,p<0.0005), more homecooked meals (oOR=2.18,p=0.001), more enjoyment of food (oOR=1.71,p=0.028), and less likelihood of overeating (oOR=0.59,p=0.033). Similarly, those who reported more “improved” sleep reported healthier overall diet (oOR=7.42,p<0.0005), more homecooked meals (oOR=2.59,p=0.001), more regular diet (oOR=2.15,p=0.006), more enjoyment of food (oOR=2.92,p<0.0005), less consumption of processed foods (oOR=0.54,p=0.039), and less overeating (0.33,p<0.0005). Those whose sleep worsened reported eating more processed foods (oOR=1.78,p=0.030) and overeating (oOR=3.90,p<0.0005). Those who reported more initial insomnia reported eating more processed foods (oOR=1.93,p=0.016), more regular diet (oOR=1.65,p=0.042), and overeating more often (oOR=4.11,p<0.0005). More middle-of-the-night insomnia was associated with eating more processed foods (oOR=2.45,p=0.001), more regular diet (oOR=1.66,p=0.031), and overeating more often (oOR=3.68, <0.0005). Those with more daytime sleepiness also reported eating more processed foods (oOR=2.36,p=0.003), more regular diet (oOR=1.79, =0.019), and overeating more often (oOR=3.28,p<0.0005). More napping was associated with a more regular diet (oOR=1.90,p=0.011) and more overeating (oOR=3.53,p<0.0005). CONCLUSION: Overall, worse sleep led to worse dietary behavior, especially eating more processed food and overeating.

During the early phase of the pandemic, it was necessary to effectively investigate all aspects of this new disease. Autopsy can be a valuable procedure to investigate the internal organs with special techniques to obtain information on the disease, especially the distribution and type of organ involvement. METHODS: During the first wave of COVID-19 in Germany, autopsies of 19 deceased patients were performed. Besides gross examination, the organs were analyzed with standard histology and polymerase-chain-reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Polymerase chain reaction positive localizations were further analyzed with immunohistochemistry and RNA-in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Eighteen of 19 patients were found to have died due to COVID-19. Clinically relevant histological changes were only observed in the lungs. Diffuse alveolar damage in considerably different degrees was noted in 18 cases. Other organs, including the central nervous system, did not show specific micromorphological alterations. In terms of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the focus remains on the upper airways and lungs. This is true for both the number of positive samples and the viral load. A highly significant inverse correlation between the stage of diffuse alveolar damage and viral load was found on a case and a sample basis. Mediastinal lymph nodes and fat were also affected by the virus at high frequencies. By contrast, other organs rarely exhibited a viral infection. Moderate to strong correlations between the methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were observed for the lungs and for other organs. CONCLUSIONS: The lung is the most affected organ in gross examination, histology and polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 detection in other organs did not reveal relevant or specific histological changes. Moreover, we did not find CNS involvement.","Hirschbühl, Klaus; Dintner, Sebastian; Beer, Martin; Wylezich, Claudia; Schlegel, Jürgen; Delbridge, Claire; Borcherding, Lukas; Lippert, Jirina; Schiele, Stefan; Müller, Gernot; Moiraki, Dimitra; Spring, Oliver; Wittmann, Michael; Kling, Elisabeth; Braun, Georg; Kröncke, Thomas; Claus, Rainer; Märkl, Bruno; Schaller, Tina",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280238/,569

OBJECTIVE: To compare severity scores used for community-acquired pneumonia to identify high-risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: PSI, CURB-65, qSOFA, and MuLBSTA, a new score for viral pneumonia, were calculated on admission to hospital to identify high-risk patients for in-hospital mortality, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or use of mechanical ventilation. Area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity for each score were determined and AUROC was compared among them. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Network. KEY RESULTS: We examined 10,238 patients with COVID-19. Mean age of patients was 66.6 years and 57.9% were males. The most common comorbidities were as follows: hypertension (49.2%), diabetes (18.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12.8%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (34.7%) and acute kidney injury (13.9%) were the most common complications. In-hospital mortality was 20.9%. PSI and CURB-65 showed the highest AUROC (0.835 and 0.825, respectively). qSOFA and MuLBSTA had a lower AUROC (0.728 and 0.715, respectively). qSOFA was the most specific score (specificity 95.7%) albeit its sensitivity was only 26.2%. PSI had the highest sensitivity (84.1%) and a specificity of 72.2%. CONCLUSIONS: PSI and CURB-65, specific severity scores for pneumonia, were better than qSOFA and MuLBSTA at predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, qSOFA, the simplest score to perform, was the most specific albeit the least sensitive.","Artero, Arturo; Madrazo, Manuel; Fernández-Garcés, Mar; Muiño Miguez, Antonio; González García, Andrés; Crestelo Vieitez, Anxela; García Guijarro, Elena; Fonseca Aizpuru, Eva María; García Gómez, Miriam; Areses Manrique, María; Martinez Cilleros, Carmen; Fidalgo Moreno, María del Pilar; Loureiro Amigo, José; Gil Sánchez, Ricardo; Rabadán Pejenaute, Elisa; Abella Vázquez, Lucy; Cañizares Navarro, Ruth; Solís Marquínez, Marta Nataya; Carrasco Sánchez, Francisco Javier; González Moraleja, Julio; Montero Rivas, Lorena; Escobar Sevilla, Joaquín; Martín Escalante, María Dolores; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo; Ramos-Rincón, José Manuel",J Gen Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575909/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06626-7,569

646223,The uncertain state of work in the U.S.: Profiles of decent work and precarious work(),2020-08-26,"A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called “I-cells”. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for “off-the-shelf” frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 are expressed on the surface of irradiated target I-cells. Utilizing this innovative strategy, these viral antigen-displaying decoy cells will be developed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease.","Ji, Henry; Yan, Ying; Ding, Beibei; Guo, Wenzhong; Brunswick, Mark; Niethammer, Andreas; SooHoo, Williams; Smith, Robin; Nahama, Alexis; Zhang, Yanliang",Med Drug Discov,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300130; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289117/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300130,569

648137,"Modelling conditional skewness: Heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions and market declines",2020-01-31,"BACKGROUND: Face masks, also referred to as half masks, are essential to protect healthcare professionals working in close contact with patients with COVID-19-related symptoms. Because of the Corona material shortages, healthcare institutions sought an approach to reuse face masks or to purchase new, imported masks. The filter quality of these masks remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the quality of sterilized and imported FFP2/KN95 face masks. METHODS: A 48-minute steam sterilization process of single-use FFP2/KN95 face masks with a 15 minute holding time at 121°C was developed, validated and implemented in the Central Sterilization Departments (CSSD) of 19 different hospitals. Masks sterilized by steam and H(2)O(2) plasma as well as new, imported masks were tested for particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and pressure drop in a custom-made test setup. RESULTS: The results of 84 masks tested on the PFE dry particle test setup showed differences of 2.3±2% (mean±SD). Test data showed that the mean PFE values of 444 sterilized FFP2 face masks from the 19 CSSDs were 90±11% (mean±SD), and those of 474 new, imported KN95/FFP2 face masks were 83±16% (mean±SD). Differences in PFE of masks received from different sterilization departments were found. CONCLUSION: Face masks can be reprocessed with 121 °C steam or H(2)O(2) plasma sterilization with a minimal reduction in PFE. PFE comparison between filter material of sterilized masks and new, imported masks indicates that the filter material of most reprocessed masks of high quality brands can outperform new, imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face masks from different sterilization departments remained efficient, using different types of sterilization equipment, can result in different PFE outcomes.","van Straten, B.; Robertson, P.

648174,Effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19: A Tale of Two Models,2020-07-27,"The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up. The percentage of pulmonary lesions on CT scans diminished from 2003 (9.40 ± 7.83)% to 2004 (3.20 ± 4.78)% (P < 0.001) and remained stable thereafter until 2018 (4.60 ± 6.37)%. Between 2006 and 2018, the proportion of patients with interstitial changes who had improved pulmonary function was lower than that of patients without lesions, as demonstrated by the one-second ratio (FEV(1)/FVC%, t = 2.21, P = 0.04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF(25%–75%), t = 2.76, P = 0.01).

648857,Country-by-Country Reporting: A Step Towards Unitary Taxation?,2021-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019, the coronavirus has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate. The transmissibility of the coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-square tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-square test. OBJECTIVE: We reanalyze the data from the city of Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS: We excluded the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopted a more appropriate statistical method, including the permutation test and the Fisher exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city of Ningbo. RESULTS: After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, the Fisher exact test yields a P value of .84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis. The odds ratio of the coronavirus transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval 0.5-2.8. CONCLUSIONS: Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we concluded that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.","Yin, Guosheng; Jin, Huaqing",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/19464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442131/,569

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the ΔQTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and ΔQTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2–62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2–425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0–443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a ΔQTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) ΔQTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [−4.0–18.0; −75.0–51.0] vs. 7.0 [−10.5–23.5; −53.0–59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine was well tolerated, and there were no drug-related non-serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who were stable and did not require hospitalization.","Sogut, Ozgur; Can, Mehmet Mustafa; Guven, Ramazan; Kaplan, Onur; Ergenc, Hüseyin; Umit, Tuba Betül; Demir, Olgun; Kaya, Murat; Akdemir, Tarık; Cakmak, Sümeyye",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720311335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348222/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720311335,569

This is considered waste milk (WM), and a convenient option for farmers is using it as calf food. However, adding to the risk of selecting resistant bacteria, residual antibiotics might interfere with the gut microbiome development and influence gastrointestinal health. We assessed the longitudinal effect of unpasteurized WM containing residual cefalexin on calf intestinal health and fecal microbiota in an 8-week trial. After 3 days of colostrum, six calves received WM and six calves received bulk tank milk (BM) for 2 weeks. For the following 6 weeks, all 12 calves received milk substitute and starter feed. Every week for the first 2 weeks and every 2 weeks for the remaining 6 weeks, we subjected all calves to clinical examination and collected rectal swabs for investigating the fecal microbiota composition. Most WM calves had diarrhea episodes in the first 2 weeks of the trial (5/6 WM and 1/6 BM), and their body weight was significantly lower than that of BM calves. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, WM calves had a lower fecal microbiota alpha diversity than that in BM calves, with the lowest p-value at Wk4 (p < 0.02), 2 weeks after exposure to WM. The fecal microbiota beta diversity of the two calf groups was also significantly different at Wk4 (p < 0.05). Numerous significant differences were present in the fecal microbiota taxonomy of WM and BM calves in terms of relative normalized operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels, affecting five phyla, seven classes, eight orders, 19 families, and 47 genera. At the end of the trial, when 6 weeks had passed since exposure to WM, the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Saccharibacteria were lower, while Chlamydiae were higher in WM calves. Notably, WM calves showed a decrease in beneficial taxa such as Faecalibacterium, with a concomitant increase in potential pathogens such as Campylobacter, Pseudomonas, and Chlamydophila spp. In conclusion, feeding pre-weaned calves with unpasteurized WM containing antibiotics is related to a higher incidence of neonatal diarrhea and leads to significant changes in the fecal microbiota composition, further discouraging this practice in spite of its short-term economic advantages.","Penati, Martina; Sala, Giulia; Biscarini, Filippo; Boccardo, Antonio; Bronzo, Valerio; Castiglioni, Bianca; Cremonesi, Paola; Moroni, Paolo; Pravettoni, Davide; Addis, Maria Filippa",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.650150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307516/,569

The study is based on material presented in two articles written 1 year apart from each other by a group of 84 authors from 20 countries. The first article, ‘Teaching in the Age of Covid-19’, consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 18 March and 5 May 2020. The second article, ‘Teaching in the Age of Covid-19 – One Year Later’, consists of short testimonies and workspace photographs collected between 17 March and 31 May 2021. This material is analysed in several different ways. Some parts of the paper treat the testimonies as personal, positional, narratives, while other parts of the paper examine the testimonies for what they represent as data. Readers are invited to read the original testimonies, view the original images and move back and forth between both narratives and data. As narratives, each author has demonstrated their individual postdigital positionality through praxis. As data, these mutually constitutive accounts offer a much larger, powerful commentary, on the position of educators across the globe during this pandemic. The discussion and conclusion blend the two understandings into a postdigital data-narrato-logy, where data and narrative interact in ways similar to interactions between theory and practice within the concept of praxis.","Jandrić, Petar; Bozkurt, Aras; McKee, Miranda; Hayes, Sarah",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-021-00252-6,569

654437,"Science in Service of Society: COVID‐19, Climate Change, and the Future",2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Detection of Acinetobacter baumannii has been relying primarily on bacterial culture that often fails to return useful results in time. Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system- and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Species-specific primers were designed to test the utility of this method. Clinical samples of A. baumannii were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to bacterial culture and a polymerase chain reaction method. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The RealAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification, and could distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. DNA was extracted by simple boiling method. Compared to bacterial culture, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The RealAmp assay only requires a single unit, and the assay positivity can be verified by visual inspection. Therefore, this assay has great potential of field use as a molecular tool for detection of A. baumannii.","Wang, Qinqin; Zhou, Yanbin; Li, Shaoli; Zhuo, Chao; Xu, Siqi; Huang, Lixia; Yang, Ling; Liao, Kang",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23843955/,569

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","Park, Sang Woo; Bolker, Benjamin M.; Champredon, David; Earn, David J.D.; Li, Michael; Weitz, Joshua S.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Dushoff, Jonathan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877,569

Despite the effort of scientific studies related to this virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is still a public health concern. MERS-CoV infection has a high mortality rate, and to date, no therapeutic or vaccine has been discovered, that is effective in treating or preventing the disease. In this review, we summarize our understanding of the molecular and biological events of compounds acting as MERS-CoV inhibitors, the outcomes of existing therapeutic options and the various drugs undergoing clinical trials. Currently, several therapeutic options have been employed, such as convalescent plasma (CP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies and repurposing of existing clinically approved drugs. However, these therapeutic options have drawbacks, thus the need for an alternative approach. The requirement for effective therapeutic treatment has brought the necessity for additional MERS treatments. We suggest that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may be used as alternative therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection. In addition, we propose the feasibility of developing effective agents by repurposing the existing and clinically approved anti-coronavirus and anti-viral peptide drugs.","Mustafa, Sabeena; Balkhy, Hanan; Gabere, Musa N.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117302125; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117302125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864360/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.08.009,569

The 3C-Like proteinase (3CL(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as an important drug target due to its role in viral replication. The lack of a potent 3CL(pro) inhibitor and the availability of the X-ray crystal structure of 3CL(pro) (PDB-ID 6LU7) motivated us to perform computational studies to identify commercially available potential inhibitors. A combination of modeling studies was performed to identify potential 3CL(pro) inhibitors from the protease inhibitor database MEROPS (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/index.shtml). Binding energy evaluation identified key residues for inhibitor design. We found 15 potential 3CL(pro) inhibitors with higher binding affinity than that of an α-ketoamide inhibitor determined via X-ray structure. Among them, saquinavir and three other investigational drugs aclarubicin, TMC-310911, and faldaprevir could be suggested as potential 3CL(pro) inhibitors.

As of October 21, 2020, more than 41.4 million confirmed cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported. Thus, it is immensely important to develop drugs and vaccines to combat COVID-19. The spike protein present on the outer surface of the virion plays a major role in viral infection by binding to receptor proteins present on the outer membrane of host cells, triggering membrane fusion and internalization, which enables release of viral ssRNA into the host cell. Understanding the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its host cell receptor protein, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is important for developing drugs and vaccines to prevent and treat COVID-19. Several crystal structures of partial and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have been reported; however, an atomistic structure of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein complexed with ACE2 is not yet available. Therefore, in our study, homology modeling was used to build the trimeric form of the spike protein complexed with human ACE2, followed by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate interactions at the interface between the spike protein and ACE2. Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) and in silico alanine scanning were employed to characterize the interacting residues at the interface. Twenty interacting residues in the spike protein were identified that are likely to be responsible for tightly binding to ACE2, of which five residues (Val445, Thr478, Gly485, Phe490, and Ser494) were not reported in the crystal structure of the truncated spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed with ACE2. These data indicate that the interactions between ACE2 and the tertiary structure of the full-length spike protein trimer are different from those between ACE2 and the truncated monomer of the spike protein RBD. These findings could facilitate the development of drugs and vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and combat COVID-19.","Sakkiah, Sugunadevi; Guo, Wenjing; Pan, Bohu; Ji, Zuowei; Yavas, Gokhan; Azevedo, Marli; Hawes, Jessica; Patterson, Tucker A.; Hong, Huixiao",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469527/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.622632,569

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 193 SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using colloidal gold-labeled and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Of those, 31 were asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, 149 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, and 14 presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower level of C-reactive protein, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (7.5 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (66.1% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than presymptomatic patients (P = 0.003) and asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.004). Viral shedding duration was longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (48.0 vs. 24.0 days, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic carriers acquired infection more from intra-familial transmission than did COVID-19 patients (89.0% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.028). In 4 familial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic carriers were mainly children and young adults while severe COVID-19 was mainly found in family members older than 60 years with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers might have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic COVID-19 patients and this antiviral immunity should be contributable to innate and adaptive cellular immunity rather than humoral immunity. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and comorbidities in familial clustering cases.","Chen, Yi; Li, Ping; Ding, Yibo; Liu, Miao; Liu, Leijie; Yi, Bo; Wu, Ting; Dong, Hongjun; Lao, Xuying; Ding, Keqing; Wang, Haibo; Zhang, Dongliang; Tan, Xiaojie; Wang, Zhongfa; Xu, Guozhang; Cao, Guangwen",J Infect Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118734/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121001209; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121001209?v=s5,569

Data have been collected from thirty-four consumers who have minimum one active social media account. These participants are contacted through telephonic interview due to maintaining the social distancing. Findings reveal that uncertainties and insecurities proof, buying as persuasion, product unavailability proof, authorities' communication, global logic, and expert opinion are some of the causes on social media platforms that developed the situation of consumer panic buying during Covid-19 crises. Furthermore, the unprecedented level of real-time information on Covid-19 at users' fingertips can give them the tools they need to make smart decisions, but also make them more anxious about what is to come; experts say that may lead to panic buying or stockpiling of products.

660653,"Bioethics, Race, and Contempt",2021-01-07,"Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic transport route that generally allows the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components, including bulk cytosol, protein aggregates, damaged or superfluous organelles and invading microbes. Target structures are sequestered by double‐membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which are formed through the concerted action of the autophagy (ATG)‐related proteins. Until recently it was assumed that ATG proteins were exclusively involved in autophagy. A growing number of studies, however, have attributed functions to some of them that are distinct from their classical role in autophagosome biogenesis. Autophagy‐independent roles of the ATG proteins include the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and resistance to pathogens. For example, they assist and enhance the turnover of dead cells and microbes upon their phagocytic engulfment, and inhibit murine norovirus replication. Moreover, bone resorption by osteoclasts, innate immune regulation triggered by cytoplasmic DNA and the ER‐associated degradation regulation all have in common the requirement of a subset of ATG proteins. Microorganisms such as coronaviruses, Chlamydia trachomatis or Brucella abortus have even evolved ways to manipulate autophagy‐independent functions of ATG proteins in order to ensure the completion of their intracellular life cycle. Taken together these novel mechanisms add to the repertoire of functions and extend the number of cellular processes involving the ATG proteins.

CASE REPORTS: Three children presented with fever, conjunctivitis, dry and cracked lips, rash, and/or cervical lymphadenopathy for at least 5 days. Two of these children required mechanical ventilation, and 1 of the 2 needed extracorpo-real membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support cardiorespiratory function. All of these children had moderate to severe hyponatremia and lymphopenia, which is usually seen in COVID-19. They were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin. All of the children recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of children with multisystem inflammation is important because they are at increased risk for deterioration. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin was used because this regimen has been shown to be beneficial in vasculitis of Kawasaki disease. The development of shock due to cardiac involvement may require ECMO.","Heidemann, Sabrina M.; Tilford, Bradley; Bauerfeld, Christian; Martin, Amarilis; Garcia, Richard U.; Yagiela, Lauren; Sarnaik, Ashok P.",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.925779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790652/,569
660829,Preparing for a future COVID-19 wave: insights and limitations from a data-driven evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Germany,2020-11-18,"This year's summit was unique given the COVID-19 pandemic: a major global outbreak that has imposed severe restrictions in all aspects of our life. At the outset, we were faced with three mutually exclusive options. First option was to cancel the summit in its entirety: this was the easiest and most obvious choice once the COVID-19 pandemic forced a near total lockdown all over the country with unprecedented disruptions of normal daily activities as the disease announced its thunderous touchdown on United States (US) soil. It was also the most-logical response faced with uncertainty regarding summit logistics and expected poor attendance due to the raging pandemic. Second option was to conduct a digital summit restricted to local audiences at Baylor College of Medicine: this option entailed implementing a virtual summit with attendance restricted to participants from our institution only. It sounded like a reasonable choice but that would impede the presence of diversity of topics, perspectives, insights and experiential learning opportunities, which are what render the summit exciting and worth attending. And finally, the last option was to conduct a digital unrestricted summit open to all interested audiences throughout the US. The conduct of a virtual summit open to all participants from around the country was initially considered daunting given the likelihood of amplified technical problems associated with an array of internet access differentials around the country, which would require a strong Information Technology (IT) presence throughout the sessions. Nonetheless, the attractiveness of going national with a virtual summit, despite the pandemic and logistical challenges, slowly gained converts and became the dominant choice. The response and level of participation in this first virtual summit showed an unanticipated surge despite the increase in registration fees to cover IT costs. This year, we had attendees from all regions of the US as well as from the United Kingdom. The range of topics was quite diverse encompassing health disparities in relation to cancers, nutrition, musculo-skeletal disorders, amputation rates, vaccination uptakes and COVID-19 infections. Various solutions were passionately presented to address these disparities including novel health technologies, community engagement and partnerships, improvement in health literacy and alternative therapeutics. There were no hitches despite the complex breakout sessions, and above all, attendees were satisfied and offered outstanding evaluation scores. This was definitely a summit that metamorphosed from pessimism to a triumphant success! Copyright © 2020 Salihu et al. Published by Global Health and Education Projects, Inc.

661159,“Swallowing the red pill”: the coronavirus pandemic and the political imaginary of stigmatized knowledge in the discourse of the far-right,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: The Tight Control of psoriatic arthritis (TICOPA) trial confirmed improved clinical outcomes with a treat to target (T2T) strategy in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This consisted of 4-weekly review and escalation of ‘step up’ therapy (single disease modifying therapy (DMARD), combination DMARDs and then biologics) based on remission criteria. Based on this, a T2T approach is supported by European PsA treatment recommendations. However, it is not commonly implemented in routine care primarily due to feasibility and cost concerns. In the TICOPA trial, the same treatment regime was used for all participants regardless of their disease profile. Despite the recognition of PsA as a highly heterogeneous condition, no studies have tailored which drugs are used depending on disease severity. The cohort will establish real world outcomes for the T2T approach in PsA and also form the basis of a trials within cohorts (TWiCs) design to test alternative therapeutic approaches within embedded clinical trials providing an evidence base for treatment strategy in PsA. METHODS: The Multicentre Observational Initiative in Treat to target Outcomes in Psoriatic Arthritis (MONITOR-PsA) cohort will apply a T2T approach within routine care. It will recruit newly diagnosed adult patients with PsA starting systemic therapies. The cohort is observational allowing routine therapeutic care within NHS clinics but a T2T approach will be supported when monitoring treatment within the cohort. Eligible participants will be adults (≥18 years) with active PsA with ≥ 1 tender or swollen joints or enthesis who have not previously had treatment with DMARDs for articular disease. DISCUSSION: This study is the first TWiC designed to support a fully powered randomised drug trial. The results from the observational cohort will be compared with those observed in the TICOPA trial investigating the clinical effectiveness and health care costs of the pragmatic T2T approach. Nested trials will provide definitive RCT evidence establishing the optimal management of PsA within the T2T approach. The TWiCs design allows robust generalizability to routine healthcare, avoids disappointment bias, aids recruitment and in future will allow assessment of longer-term outcomes.

This project is developed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and promotes the continuing involvement of health researchers and professionals in the collaborative production of knowledge on health with patients and community groups and in their training as community health promoters. The new epidemic scenario created the demand for a space of dialogue and knowledge-sharing on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Due to the interruption of regular activities in the Knowledge-Sharing Platform, a strategy was launched to serve as a link between science and society and help overcome the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The WhatsApp group allowed project members to participate by addressing questions (audio) on COVID-19 through mediation by community group leaders. The main questions by participants related to risk factors, transmission, immunity to the novel coronavirus, care related to prevention, symptoms, and treatment; and COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. The educational material Caring in the Age of COVID-19 was produced and shared with community leaders and distributed to the respective groups and was eventually shared in their communities as a response to a demand for knowledge that responds to the concerns of people already exposed to structural vulnerability.","Souza, Claudia Teresa Vieira de; Santana, Clarice Silva de; Ferreira, Patrícia; Nunes, João Arriscado; Teixeira, Maria de Lourdes Benamor; Gouvêa, Maria Isabel Fragoso da Silveira",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00115020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609168/,569

Derangements in nutritional status, both for obesity and malnutrition, are relevant for the clinical outcome in acute illness. Systemic inflammation, immune system impairment, sarcopenia, and preexisting associated conditions, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases related to obesity, could act as crucial factors linking nutritional status and the course and outcome of COVID-19. Nevertheless, vitamins and trace elements play an essential role in modulating immune response and inflammatory status. Overall, evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is not negligible for its implications on susceptibility, course, severity, and responsiveness to therapies, in order to perform a tailored nutritional intervention as an integral part of the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to review the current data on the relevance of nutritional status, including trace elements and vitamin status, in influencing the course and outcome of the disease 3 mo after the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic.","Fedele, Debora; De Francesco, Antonella; Riso, Sergio; Collo, Alessandro",Nutrition,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900720302999; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.111016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900720302999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059127/,569

662580,Empowering clinical research in a decentralized world,2021-07-01,"Purpose Currently, there are about 15 ongoing clinical studies on low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the underlying assumptions is that irradiation of 0.5–1.5 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. We aimed to reanalyze all available experimental radiobiological data to assess evidence for such amelioration. Methods and Materials With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature review, we re-analyzed thirteen radiobiological animal datasets published in 1937-1973 in which animals (guinea pigs/dogs/cats/rats/mice) received radiation before or after bacterial/viral inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality/pneumonia morbidity). In most datasets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Results For six studies evaluating post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with one study showing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing a significant decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. Among the remaining four studies, mortality risk was non-significantly increased in two studies and non-significantly decreased in two others (p>0.05). For pre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with six (of eight) datasets showing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality risk associated with radiation exposure and the other two showing a significant decrease (p<0.05) in mortality or pneumonitis morbidity risk. Conclusions These data do not provide support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction of effect is difficult to interpret. One must be cautious about adducing evidence from such published reports of old animal datasets.","Little, Mark P.; Zhang, Wei; van Dusen, Roy; Hamada, Nobuyuki",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360301620343546; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301620343546?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.09.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011212/,569

While parenting is essential for positive development, increased parental distress has interfered with children’s wellbeing. In our study, we aimed to identify the predictors of parental distress in families of children with neuropsychiatric disorders during lockdown. Seventy-seven parents of children with neuropsychiatric disorders were asked to fill three online questionnaires (a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Parental-Stress-Index (PSI-4-SF) to explore the relationship between parental distress, emotional/behavioral problems in children and quarantine-related factors through univariate analyses and multiple mediation models. Significant positive associations between CBCL-internalizing-problems and all PSI-4-SF subscales, and between CBCL-externalizing-problems and “Difficult Child” subscales were found. “Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction” subscale and teachers–child relationship quality resulted negatively associated, as well as the “Difficult Child” subscale and peers–child relationship quality. The effect of teachers–child relationship quality on “Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction” was mediated by children internalizing problems, while the effect of peers–child relationship quality on “Difficult Child” by the child internalizing/externalizing problems. Internalizing problems in children with neuropsychiatric disorders were among the strongest predictors of parental stress during lockdown, mediating the indirect effects of quarantine-related factors, thus suggesting the importance of their detection during and after emergency situations to provide assistance and reduce parenting pressure.","Sesso, Gianluca; Bonaventura, Eleonora; Buchignani, Bianca; Della Vecchia, Stefania; Fedi, Caterina; Gazzillo, Marisa; Micomonaco, Jessica; Salvati, Andrea; Conti, Eugenia; Cioni, Giovanni; Muratori, Filippo; Masi, Gabriele; Milone, Annarita; Battini, Roberta",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360193/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157902,569
663466,Now is the time to reassess fieldwork-based research,2021,"OBJECTIVE: While COVID-19 symptoms impact rhinology (anosmia) and laryngology (airways), two major disciplines of the otolaryngology armamentarium, the virus has seemed to spare the auditory system. A recent study, however, reported changes in otoacoustic emission (OAE) signals measured in SARS-COV-2 positive patients. We sought to assess the effect of COVID-19 infection on auditory performance in a cohort of recovered SARS-COV-2 patients and controls. To avoid a potential bias of previous audiological dysfunction not related to SARS-COV-2 infection, the study encompasses patients with normal auditory history. We hypothesized that if SARS-COV-2 infection predisposes to hearing loss, we would observe subtle and early audiometric deficits in our cohort in the form of subclinical auditory changes. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: The Institutional Review Board approved the study and we recruited participants who had been positive for SARS-COV-2 infection, according to an Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test on two nasopharyngeal swabs. The patients included in this study were asymptomatic for the SARS-COV-2 infection and were evaluated following recovery, confirmed by repeated swab testing. The control group comprised healthy individuals matched for age and sex, and with a normal auditory and otologic history. INTERVENTION(S): The eligibility to participate in this study included a normal audiogram, no previous auditory symptoms, normal otoscopy examination with an intact tympanic membrane, and bilateral tympanometry type A. None of our volunteers reported any new auditory symptoms following SARS-COV-2 infection. Ototacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements were used to evaluate the auditory function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): OAE and ABR measurements. RESULTS: We have found no significant differences between recovered asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients and controls in any of transitory evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), or ABR responses. CONCLUSIONS: There is no cochlear dysfunction represented by ABR, TEOAE, and DPOAE responses in recovered COVID-19 asymptomatic patients. Retrocochlear function was also preserved as evident by the ABR responses. A long-term evaluation of a larger cohort of SARS-COV-2 patients will help to identify a possible contribution of SARS-COV-2 infection to recently published anecdotal auditory symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Dror, Amiel A.; Kassis-Karayanni, Najla; Oved, Adi; Daoud, Amani; Eisenbach, Netanel; Mizrachi, Matti; Rayan, Doaa; Francis, Shawky; Layous, Eli; Gutkovich, Yoni Evgeni; Taiber, Shahar; Srouji, Samer; Chordekar, Shai; Goldenstein, Sonia; Ziv, Yael; Ronen, Ohad; Gruber, Maayan; Avraham, Karen B.; Sela, Eyal",Otol Neurotol,https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000003037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967243/,569
663937,Hygienic and ecological risks connected with utilization of animal manures and biosolids in agriculture(),2006-05-02,"Bovine coronavirus (BoCV) is an important pathogen of cattle, causing severe enteric disease and playing a role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. Similar to other coronaviruses, a remarkable variability characterizes both its genome and biology. Despite their potential relevance, different aspects of the evolution of BoCV remain elusive. The present study reconstructs the history and evolution of BoCV using a phylodynamic approach based on complete genome and spike protein sequences. The results demonstrate high mutation and recombination rates affecting different parts of the viral genome. In the spike gene, this variability undergoes significant selective pressures—particularly episodic pressure—located mainly on the protein surface, suggesting an immune-induced selective pressure. The occurrence of compensatory mutations was also identified. On the contrary, no strong evidence in favor of host and/or tissue tropism affecting viral evolution has been proven. The well-known plasticity is thus ascribable to the innate broad viral tropism rather than mid- or long-term adaptation. The evaluation of the geographic spreading pattern clearly evidenced two clusters: a European cluster and an American–Asian cluster. While a relatively dense and quick migration network was identified in the former, the latter was dominated by the primary role of the United States (US) as a viral exportation source. Since the viral spreading pattern strongly mirrored the cattle trade, the need for more intense monitoring and preventive measures cannot be underestimated as well as the need to enforce the vaccination of young animals before international trade, to reduce not only the clinical impact but also the transferal and mixing of BoCV strains.","Franzo, Giovanni; Drigo, Michele; Legnardi, Matteo; Grassi, Laura; Pasotto, Daniela; Menandro, Maria Luisa; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33182765/,569

664547,Placebo: Its action and place in health research today* — Summary and conclusions,2004,"Abstract We have previously reported that the 3C-like proteinase of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible for processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to three mature products of 24, 10, and 100 kDa (Liuet al.,1994, 1997; Ng and Liu, 1998). The C-terminal cleavage site of the 100-kDa protein was defined to be the Q891(1b)-S892(1b)dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 15,129 to 15,134 (Liu and Brown, 1995). In this report, other cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase in the polyprotein encoded by the ORF 1b region were mapped by coexpression, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Using two ORF 1b-specific antisera, V58 and V17, three more Q-S(G) dipeptide bonds, encoded by nucleotides 16,929 to 16,934, 18,492 to 18,497, and 19,506 to 19,511, respectively, were demonstrated to be the cleavage sites of the 3C-like proteinase. Cleavage at these four positions would result in the release of four mature products with molecular masses of approximately 68, 58, 39, and 35 kDa. Among them, the 39- and 35-kDa proteins were specifically identified in IBV-infected cells. Taken together with the 100-kDa protein previously identified, these results suggest that the ORF 1b region of IBV mRNA1 may be able to encode five mature products.","Liu, D. X.; Shen, S.; Xu, H.

Understanding the timeline of antibody decline is important for interpreting SARS-CoV-2 serology results. Serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline health care personnel at 13 hospitals and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during April 3-June 19, 2020, and again approximately 60 days later to assess this timeline. The percentage of participants who experienced seroreversion, defined as an antibody signal-to-threshold ratio >1.0 at baseline and <1.0 at the follow-up visit, was assessed. Overall, 194 (6.0%) of 3,248 participants had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (1). Upon repeat testing approximately 60 days later (range = 50-91 days), 146 (93.6%) of 156 participants experienced a decline in antibody response indicated by a lower signal-to-threshold ratio at the follow-up visit, compared with the baseline visit, and 44 (28.2%) experienced seroreversion. Participants with higher initial antibody responses were more likely to have antibodies detected at the follow-up test than were those who had a lower initial antibody response. Whether decay in these antibodies increases risk for reinfection and disease remains unanswered. However, these results suggest that serology testing at a single time point is likely to underestimate the number of persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a negative serologic test result might not reliably exclude prior infection.","Self, Wesley H.; Tenforde, Mark W.; Stubblefield, William B.; Feldstein, Leora R.; Steingrub, Jay S.; Shapiro, Nathan I.; Ginde, Adit A.; Prekker, Matthew E.; Brown, Samuel M.; Peltan, Ithan D.; Gong, Michelle N.; Aboodi, Michael S.; Khan, Akram; Exline, Matthew C.; Files, D.

665756,Social distance monitoring framework using deep learning architecture to control infection transmission of COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-17,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Supply of raw materials such as corn and soybean meal as livestock and poultry feeds may be limited and is a significant concern during the Covid-19 pandemic especially for the countries that depend on importation of raw materials. Consequently, the palm kernel cake has been proposed as an alternative raw material for animal feeds to reduce importation dependency. The chemical composition of palm kernel cake varies depending on the method of oil extraction. The crude fiber content of palm kernel cake is acceptable to most ruminants but is considered high for poultry. Biodegradation of palm kernel cake through solid-state fermentation can improve its nutritional quality, improving broiler health status and growth performance. ABSTRACT: Palm kernel cake (PKC), a by-product of oil extracted from palm nuts through expeller press or solvent extraction procedures is one of the highest quantities of locally available and potentially inexpensive agricultural product. PKC provides approximately 14–18% of crude protein (CP), 12–20% crude fiber (CF), 3–9% ether extract (EE), and different amounts of various minerals that feasible to be used as a partial substitute of soybean meal (SBM) and corn in poultry nutrition. Poultry’s digestibility is reported to be compromised due to the indigestion of the high fiber content, making PKC potentially low for poultry feeding. Nevertheless, solid-state fermentation (SSF) can be applied to improve the nutritional quality of PKC by improving the CP and reducing CF content. PKC also contains β-mannan polysaccharide, which works as a prebiotic. However, there is a wide variation for the inclusion level of PKC in the broiler diet. These variations may be due to the quality of PKC, its sources, processing methods and value-added treatment. It has been documented that 10–15% of treated PKC could be included in the broiler’s diets. The inclusion levels will not contribute to a negative impact on the growth performances and carcass yield. Furthermore, it will not compromise intestinal microflora, morphology, nutrient digestibility, and immune system. PKC with a proper SSF process (FPKC) can be offered up to 10–15% in the diets without affecting broilers’ production performance.","Azizi, Mohammad Naeem; Loh, Teck Chwen; Foo, Hooi Ling; Teik Chung, Eric Lim",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572711/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020338,569

Viral replication kinetics and efficiency-of-plating analysis performed at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures revealed that changes in the macrodomain alone were both necessary and sufficient for the ts phenotype. Interestingly, mutations in the PLP2 domain were not responsible for the temperature sensitivity but did reduce the frequency of reversion of macrodomain mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation studies are consistent with an interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. Expression studies of the macrodomain-PLP2 portion of nsp3 indicate that the ts mutations enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein. Furthermore, we found that during virus infection, the replicase proteins containing the MAC and PLP2 mutations were more rapidly degraded at the nonpermissive temperature than were the wild-type proteins. Importantly, we show that the macrodomain and PLP2 mutant viruses trigger production of type I interferon in vitro and are attenuated in mice, further highlighting the importance of the macrodomain-PLP2 interplay in viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging human and veterinary pathogens with pandemic potential. Despite the established and predicted threat these viruses pose to human health, there are currently no approved countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in humans. Viral macrodomains, enzymes that remove posttranslational ADP-ribosylation of proteins, and viral multifunctional papain-like proteases, enzymes that cleave polyproteins and remove polyubiquitin chains via deubiquitinating activity, are two important virulence factors. Here, we reveal an unanticipated interplay between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain that is important for replication and antagonizing the host innate immune response. Targeting the interaction of these enzymes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat CoV disease.","Deng, Xufang; Mettelman, Robert C.; O’Brien, Amornrat; Thompson, John A.; O’Brien, Timothy E.; Baker, Susan C.",Journal of Virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02140-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918076/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/12/e02140-18.full.pdf,569
668132,Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first five months in the Western Pacific Region,2021-01-05,"As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues its course in 2020, telehealth technology provides opportunities to connect patients and providers. Health policies have been amended to allow easy access to virtual health care, highlighting the field’s dynamic ability to adapt to a public health crisis. Academic detailing, a peer-to-peer collaborative outreach designed to improve clinical decision-making, has traditionally relied on in-person encounters for effectiveness. A growth in the adoption of telehealth technology translates to increases in academic detailing reach for providers unable to meet with academic detailers in person. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has used academic detailing to promote and reinforce evidence-based practices and has encouraged more virtual academic detailing (e-Detailing). Moreover, VA academic detailers are primarily clinical pharmacy specialists who provide clinical services and education and have made meaningful contributions to improving health care at VA. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and physical isolation orders, VA academic detailers have continued to meet with providers to disseminate critical health care information in a timely fashion by using video-based telehealth. When working through the adoption of virtual technology for the delivery of medical care, providers may need time and nontraditional delivery of “evidence” before eliciting signals for change. Academic detailers are well suited for this role and can develop plans to help address provider discomfort surrounding the use of telehealth technology. By using e-Detailing as a method for both familiarizing and normalizing health professionals with video-based telehealth technology, pharmacists are uniquely poised to deliver consultation and direct-care services. Moreover, academic detailing pharmacists are ambassadors of change, serving an important role navigating the evolution of health care in response to emergent public health crises and helping define the norms of care delivery to follow.","Hoffman, Jonathan D.; Shayegani, Ramona; Spoutz, Patrick M.; Hillman, Ashley D.; Smith, Jason P.; Wells, Daina L.; Popish, Sarah J.; Himstreet, Julianne E.; Manning, Jane M.; Bounthavong, Mark; Christopher, Melissa L.D.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319120303186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747164/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319120303186; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.06.028,569
669468,"Data-driven Framework for Delineating Urban Population Dynamic Patterns: Case Study on Xiamen Island, China",2020-07-04,"In this study, we isolated and identified 2 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains from layer chickens soon after vaccination with the Massachusetts–Connecticut bivalent vaccine (Conn) and H120 and 4/91 booster vaccines in China in 2011. The results of cross-virus-neutralization tests and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit of spike gene of these vaccine strains and other reference strains showed that strain LJL/110302 was of GI-19 lineage, whereas LLN/111169 was of the GI-1 lineage of the Conn serotype. Further comparative genomic analysis revealed that LLN/111169, an IBV strain with novel traits, originated from multiple recombination events (at least 3 recombination sites) between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. LLN/111169 was pathogenic to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. This is of prime importance because while IBV prevention measures worldwide are mainly dependent on modified live vaccine strains, our results showed that recombination between field and vaccine strains has produced a novel pathogenic IBV strain. In addition, LLN/111169 showed relatively broad tissue tropism (trachea, lungs, kidneys, and cecal tonsils) in infected SPF chickens. These results emphasize the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.","Ren, Mengting; Han, Zongxi; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang; Ma, Deying",Poult Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119580579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241473/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119580579; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.11.056,569
670536,Bariatric Surgery is Safe for Patients After Recovery from COVID-19,2021-07-31,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARs-CoV-2. The virus is transmitted from person to person through droplet infections i.e. when infected person is in close contact with another person. In January 2020, first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces, has made it clear that human wastewater might contain this virus. This may illustrate the probability of environmentally facilitated transmission, mainly the sewage, however, environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal oral transmission is not yet clear. We used existing Pakistan polio environment surveillance network to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. An additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced, prior RNA extraction, to increase viral RNA yield resulting a decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID 19 patients and quarantine center strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as supplementary system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 testing capacity or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention is needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs.","Sharif, Salmaan; Ikram, Aamer; Khurshid, Adnan; Salman, Muhammad; Mehmood, Nayab; Arshad, Yasir; Ahmed, Jamal; Safdar, Rana Muhammad; Rehman, Lubna; Mujtaba, Ghulam; Hussain, Jaffar; Ali, Johar; Angez, Mehar; Alam, Muhammad Masroor; Akthar, Ribqa; Wasif Malik, Muhammad; Iqbal Baig, Mirza Zeeshan; Suleman Rana, Muhammad; Usman, Muhammad; Qaisar Ali, Muhammad; Ahad, Abdul; Badar, Nazish; Umair, Massab; Tamim, Sana; Ashraf, Asiya; Tahir, Faheem; Ali, Nida",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185787/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249568,569

This includes not only hepatotropic viruses (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C) but also bacterial and parasitic infections such as amebiasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, or echinococcosis. Recent studies of the immune mechanisms underlying liver disease show that monocytes play an essential role in determining patient outcomes. Monocytes are derived from the mononuclear phagocyte lineage in the bone marrow and are present in nearly all tissues of the body; these cells function as part of the early innate immune response that reacts to challenge by external pathogens. Due to their special ability to develop into tissue macrophages and dendritic cells and to change from an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, monocytes play a pivotal role in infectious and non-infectious liver diseases: they can maintain inflammation and support resolution of inflammation. Therefore, tight regulation of monocyte recruitment and termination of monocyte-driven immune responses in the liver is prerequisite to appropriate healing of organ damage. In this review, we discuss monocyte-dependent immune mechanisms underlying hepatic infectious disorders. Better understanding of these immune mechanisms may lead to development of new interventions to treat acute liver disease and prevent progression to organ failure.","Sellau, Julie; Puengel, Tobias; Hoenow, Stefan; Groneberg, Marie; Tacke, Frank; Lotter, Hannelore",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829283/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-021-00852-1,569
672453,The concept of procedural law regarding the implementation of collective agreements with legal certainty in termination of employment in Indonesia,2021-04-05,"OBJECTIVES: Intensive health services’ utilization is common in older individuals affected by chronic diseases. This study assessed whether a structured family nurse-led educational intervention would be effective in reducing health services’ use (readmissions and/or emergency service access) among older people affected by chronic conditions. METHODS: This is a non-randomized before-after pilot study. A sample of 78 patients was recruited from two general practices in Italy and 70 among them were followed for 8 months. Standard home care was provided during the first four months’ period (months 1–4), followed by the educational intervention until the end of the study (months 5–8). The intervention, based on the teach-back method, consisted of by-weekly 60-min home sessions targeting aspects of the disease and its treatment, potential complications, medication adherence, and health behaviours. Rates of health services’ use were collected immediately before (T0), and after the interventions (T1). Differences in utilization rates were examined by the McNemar’s test. Potential factors associated with the risk of health services’ use were explored with a Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: The sample (n = 78) was predominantly female (n = 50, 64.1%), and had a mean age of 76.2 (SD = 4.8) years. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent disease (n = 27, 34.6%). McNemar’s test indicated a significant reduction in health services’ use at T1 (McNemar χ(2) = 28.03, P < 0.001). Cox regressions indicated that time and patient education, as well as their interaction, were the only variables positively associated with the probability of health services’ use. CONCLUSION: A teach-back intervention led by a family nurse practitioner has the potential to reduce health services’ use in older patients with chronic diseases.","Savini, Serenella; Iovino, Paolo; Monaco, Dario; Marchini, Roberta; Di Giovanni, Tiziana; Donato, Giuseppe; Pulimeno, Ausilia; Matera, Carmela; Quintavalle, Giuseppe; Turci, Carlo",Int J Nurs Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2021.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307774/,569
672497,CHECKED: Chinese COVID-19 fake news dataset,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Demand-side barriers to health care are as important as supply-side factors in deterring patients from obtaining effective treatment during COVID-19. Developing countries, including Togo, have focused on reducing the risk of health care utilization during this period by ensuring basic health care services as an important policy to improve health outcomes and meet international obligations to make health services accessible. METHODS: The data used to cover all 44 districts in the six (6) health regions of Togo, are from a national home survey. They are collected from July 8th to 17th, 2020. In each district chief town, a minimum of thirty (30) households were included by a systematic two-stage random draw (neighborhood and then home). Based on these data, the multinomial regression model was used to identify risk factors for the request for health care services during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1946 (with a response rate of 98.3%) participants were addressed in the study. The finding on households with age above 60 years indicated that the relative risk ratio (RRR = 23.97; 95% CI = 0.93; 615.38) allowed them to practice self-medication in lieu of modern healthcare facilities. The multinomial model revealed that the relative risk ratio of pre-COVID-19 activities (RRR = 4.87; 95% CI = 1.018; 23.38) permits households to rely on their self-medication choice and (RRR = 3.14; 95% CI = 0.91; 0.83) prefer public health facilities. Given that the head of the households (RRR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.017, 2.11) is educated, he prefers the choice of private health centers during COVID-19 pandemic to public health facilities. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the majority (30.49%) of patients sought health care. The analysis shows that the loss of employment, activities before COVID-19 in households and areas not infected by the pandemics allow them to ask for health care (self-medication and public hospitals) despite the COVID-19 impacts. However, higher education and age determine a different choice of health care delivery by households. Thus, policy makers need to cast special emphasis on social policies to address home health shocks.","Tossou, Yaovi",Health Econ Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34536153/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13561-021-00335-x,569

We describe our experience with teleconsultation in surgical patients during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and evaluate patient satisfaction and the feasibility of maintaining it as a future strategy in selected patients. METHODS: An observational, retrospective, single-site cohort study was carried out by reviewing electronic medical records and conducting a telephone survey. RESULTS: 1,706 teleconsultations have been carried out: 59.5% of patients were rescheduled, 26.1% have been solved and of these 57.3% (255 patients) have been discharged; 12.19% were not contacted. The 73.6% considered that teleconsultation was able to fully or partially resolve the reason for their medical appointment; 61.6% were willing to continue with teleconsultation; 15.2% of the patients needed some kind of help or required a second call to speak with a family member, and 37.2% would preferred a face-to-face visit because of difficulties with the teleconsultation. The overall satisfaction was 8.7 out of 10. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has demonstrated to be a useful tool even for surgical patients during Covid-19 pandemia. A high proportion of patients can be managed by telephone call. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction. Teleconsultation is a feasible strategy not also during the current Covid-19 pandemic but also for future.","Ruiz de la Hermosa, Alicia; Viejo-Martínez, Elena; Valdazo-Gómez, Adela; Camacho-Aroca, Alfonso; Marques-Medina, Elia; Paseiro-Crespo, Gloria",Minerva surgery,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-5691.21.08973-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338465/,569

However, their capacity to predict mortality, particularly the AST/ALT ratio, commonly referred to as the De Ritis ratio, is unknown. We investigated the association between the De Ritis ratio on admission and in‐hospital mortality in 105 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) admitted to three COVID‐19 referral centres in Sardinia, Italy. The De Ritis ratio was significantly lower in survivors than nonsurvivors (median: 1.25; IQR: 0.91‐1.64 vs 1.67; IQR: 1.38‐1.97, P = .002) whilst there were no significant between‐group differences in ALT and AST concentrations. In ROC curve analysis, the AUC value of the De Ritis ratio was 0.701 (95% CI 0.603‐0.787, P = .0006) with sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 70%, respectively. Kaplan‐Meier survival curves showed a significant association between the De Ritis ratio and mortality (logrank test P = .014). By contrast, no associations were observed between the ALT and AST concentrations and mortality (logrank test P = .83 and P = .62, respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the HR in patients with De Ritis ratios ≥1.63 (upper tertile of this parameter) remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, cardiovascular disease, intensity of care, diabetes, respiratory diseases, malignancies and kidney disease (HR: 2.46, 95% CI 1.05‐5.73, P = .037). Therefore, the De Ritis ratio on admission was significantly associated with in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients.

The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for an invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make the RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in a reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human receptor protein compared to SARS-CoV. The phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study adds more insight into the critical dynamics of the key residues at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and potentially aids the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","Ngo, Van A.; Jha, Ramesh K.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582502/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257905,569

Using a mixed-method analysis, the paper identifies that pay-cuts have been the most common financial issue across all skill levels, with nearly half of respondents reporting deductions from their salaries. The research also identifies that while all three groups of migrants have used various coping mechanisms to mitigate the pandemic’s financial impact, highly-skilled migrants have been more successful in weathering the storm than others due to their accumulated savings.

The management relies on empirical therapy, which takes into account the severity of the infectious episode, the presence of additional risk factors, co-morbidities and institutionalization.","Drieux, L.",Antibiotiques (Paris),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1294550110000610; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1294550110000610,569
679698,Fixed income mutual fund performance during and after a crisis: a Canadian case,2021-03-04,"Over the last months, mathematical models have been extensively used to help control the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.","Reis, Ruy Freitas; Oliveira, Rafael Sachetto; Quintela, Bárbara de Melo; Campos, Joventino de Oliveira; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.623521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796495/,569
680237,Can COVID‐19 in pregnancy cause preeclampsia?,2020-06-22,"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are nanostructures that resemble the structures of viruses. They are composed of one or more structural proteins that can be arranged in several layers and can also contain a lipid outer envelope. VLPs trigger a high humoral and cellular immune response due to their repetitive structures. A key factor regarding VLP safety is the lack of viral genomic material, which enhances safety during both manufacture and administration. Contemporary VLP production may take advantage of several systems, including bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. The choice of production platform depends on several factors, including cost and the need for post-translational modifications (PTMs), which can be essential in generating an optimal immune response. Some VLP-based vaccines designed to prevent several infectious diseases are already approved and on the market, with many others at the clinical trial or research stage. Interest in this technology has recently increased due to its advantages over classical vaccines. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of VLP production systems and the newest generation of VLP-based vaccines now available.","Fuenmayor, J.; Gòdia, F.; Cervera, L.",N Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2017.07.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678416325511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778817/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871678416325511,569
680530,Commentary for the Elderly in the Pandemic Era,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are difficult to recognise and control due to its high infectivity and the wide range of clinical manifestations of the infection. An outbreak at Watford general hospital provided an opportunity to recognise the complexity involved in a COVID-19 outbreak investigation. METHODS: An outbreak control team (OCT) was convened. The terms outbreak, a case and a significant exposure were defined as per Public Health England (PHE) Guidance and in the context of the local outbreak. Root cause analyses (RCAs) were carried out on cases to identify possible causes, possible route of transmission and any learning points. All contact patients and staff were screened with RT PCR and genomic sequencing was performed on a set of positive specimens. In addition to active contact tracing, screening and cohorting of patients and staff, standard and transmission-based precautions were reinforced to control the outbreak. FINDINGS: Fifteen patients and four staff members were identified in this outbreak investigation. With contact tracing, screening and through strict infection control measures the outbreak was brought under control. CONCLUSION: We could successfully contain the spread of this outbreak following PHE outbreak control guidelines and our local guidelines. We recognised several challenges in investigating a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting. Problems arising from variable sensitivity of the tests, difficulty in differentiating COVID-19 related symptoms from underlying diseases, problems related to establishing the route of transmission, issues with contact tracing are discussed. Additionally, the importance and limitations of genomic studies in COVID-19 are discussed.","Kannangara, Chiranthi Iresha; Seetulsingh, Prema; Foley, Jiovanna; Bennett, Glynis; Carter, Tracey",Infect Prev Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590088921000457; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2021.100156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088921000457?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337381/,569

The Perceived Social Support for Job Search Activity Scale (PSS-JSAS) was developed to assess the quality of social support a job seeker receives during a job search. Building on this previous work, the present study assessed the PSS-JSAS’s factor structure, construct validity, reliability, and measurement invariance in the context of Ghana. Data for the present analysis were provided by 429 recent university graduates. The sample was randomly split into two subsamples for exploratory factor analysis (EFA; n = 223) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; n = 206). EFA and parallel analysis with the first subsample suggested a single factor structure, comprising 6 items out of the original 8 items. In CFA with the second subsample, the construct validity of the single factor structure was found to be optimal. Multi-group CFA with the second subsample showed that the single factor structure was invariant across gender. Further, reliability analysis on the total sample and the subsamples demonstrated good internal consistency reliability for the 6 items. The validity evidence obtained in this study suggests that the PSS-JSAS has good psychometric properties and is thus suitable for assessing social support for job search efforts of university graduates.","Teye-Kwadjo, Enoch",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413620/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02164-x,569

But its association with COVID-19 epidemics in the European Union (EU) is unclear. In this quasi-experimental study, we modelled the temporal trends in human mobility and epidemics of COVID-19 in the 27 EU states between January 15 and May 9, 2020. COVID-19 and human mobility had 3 trend-segments, including an upward trend in COVID-19 daily incidence and a downward trend in most human mobilities in the middle segment. Compared with the EU states farther from Italy, the state-wide lockdown dates were more likely linked to turning points of human mobilities in the EU states closer to Italy, which were also more likely linked to second turning points of COVID-19 epidemics. Among the examined human mobilities, the second turning points in driving mobility and the first turning points in parks mobility were the best factors that connected lockdown dates and COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states closer to Italy. Our findings highlight the state- and mobility-heterogeneity in the associations of public health interventions and human mobility with changes of COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states.","Yuan, X.; Hu, K.; Xu, J.; Zhang, X.; Bao, W.; Lynch, C.

Within one week, the Chinese authorities reported that they had identified the causative agent as a new member of the Coronavirus family, the same family of that was responsible for MERS and SARS not so many years ago. The new virus was called Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission, the virus had spread across several countries in three continents, and had infected close to two thousand people, of whom at least 1 in 5 quite severely. The number of fatalities was fast rising. Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov. It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.

The study aimed to comparatively evaluate the role of H and PMR on anxiety, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SPO(2)), blood pressure (BP), pain, and analgesic requirement during extraction in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty children aged 8–12 years undergoing primary molar extractions were randomly allocated to three groups—H, PMR, and control (C). The anxiety (proposed Visual Facial Anxiety scale), HR, and SPO(2) were measured pre/post-operatively with/without interventions (H, PMR, C) at 4 intervals. The BP and pain (Wong-Baker faces pain scale) were recorded pre- and post-operatively. Need for analgesic post-operatively was assessed. RESULTS: Statistically significant reduction in anxiety was noted post-extraction in H (0.30 ± 0.80), PMR (0.50 ± 0.69) (p < 0.001*). HR showed a statistically significant drop after H, PMR application. (p < 0.001*) No significant difference in SPO(2) was noted in the three groups (p > 0.05). Pain control was well achieved using H (85%), PMR (70%); BP was well-regulated in the H, PMR compared to C group (p < 0.001*). Need for analgesics was reduced in H (45%), PMR (50%) versus C (100%). Both techniques H, PMR were comparable in all measures.

686704,Main challenges to international student mobility in the European arena,2021-09-26,"Objectives Detection of antibodies to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in a single assay could increase diagnostic accuracy, differentiate vaccination from natural disease, and aid in retrospective exposure determination. Correlation of binding antibody assessment in clinical assays with neutralizing antibodies is needed to better understand the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish of correlates of protection. Methods A cohort of 752 samples was used to assess specificity, sensitivity, and comparison to 6 other Conformitè Europëenne serologic assays for the BioRad SARS-CoV-2 IgG multiplex assay which measures receptor binding domain IgG (RBD), spike-S1 IgG (S1), spike-S2 IgG (S2), and nucleocapsid IgG (N). A subset of serial specimens from 14 patients was also tested for neutralizing antibodies (n=61). Results Specificity for RBD and S1 IgG was 99.4% (n=170) and 100% for S2 and N IgG (n=170) in a cohort selected for probable interference. Overall assay concordance with other assays was >93% for IgG and total antibody assays and reached 100% sensitivity for clinical concordance at >14 days as a multiplex assay. RBD and S1 binding antibody positivity demonstrated 79-95% agreement with the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions The BioRad SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay is comparable to existing assays, and achieved 100% sensitivity when all markers were included. The ability to measure antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins simultaneously may be advantageous for complex clinical presentations, epidemiologic research, and in decisions regarding infection prevention strategies. Additional independent validations are needed to further determine binding antibody and neutralizing antibody correlations.","Cook, Nathan; Xu, Lingqing; Hegazy, Shaymaa; Wheeler, Bradley J.; Anderson, Adam R; Critelli, Nancy; Yost, Mary; McElroy, Anita K.; Shurin, Michael R.; Wheeler, Sarah E.",Clin Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453893/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912021002277?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2021.08.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912021002277,569
