We recently reported that enteral delivery of proteins markedly stimulated global duodenal protein synthesis in carbohydrate-fed healthy humans, but specifically affected proteins remain unknown. Objective: We aimed to assess the influence of an enteral protein supply on the duodenal mucosal proteome in carbohydrate-fed humans. Design: Six healthy volunteers received for 5 h, on 2 occasions and in random order, either an enteral infusion of maltodextrins alone (0.25 g · kg(−1) · h(−1)) mimicking the fed state or maltodextrins with a protein powder (0.14 g proteins · kg(−1) · h(−1)). Endoscopic duodenal biopsy specimens were then collected and frozen until analysis. A 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis–based comparative proteomics analysis was then performed, and differentially expressed proteins (at least ±1.5-fold change; Student’s t test, P < 0.05) were identified by mass spectrometry. Protein expression changes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Results: Thirty-two protein spots were differentially expressed after protein delivery compared with maltodextrins alone: 28 and 4 spots were up- or downregulated, respectively. Among the 22 identified proteins, 11 upregulated proteins were involved either in the cytoskeleton (ezrin, moesin, plastin 1, lamin B1, vimentin, and β-actin) or in protein biosynthesis (glutamyl-prolyl–transfer RNA synthetase, glutaminyl–transfer RNA synthetase, elongation factor 2, elongation factor 1δ, and eukaryotic translation and initiation factor 3 subunit f). Conclusions: Enteral delivery of proteins altered the duodenal mucosal proteome and mainly stimulated the expression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton and protein biosynthesis. These results suggest that protein supply may affect intestinal morphology by stimulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01254110.","Goichon, Alexis; Bertrand, Julien; Chan, Philippe; Lecleire, Stéphane; Coquard, Aude; Cailleux, Anne-Françoise; Vaudry, David; Déchelotte, Pierre; Coëffier, Moïse",Am J Clin Nutr,536,3

The study group of 133 women and 37 men had a mean age of 85 years and 59% had one or more chronic medical conditions. The immunization rates by home for the 170 symptomatic residents ranged from 8% to 90% (mean 45%). Seventy-one sera, 36 from vaccinated and 35 from non-vaccinated residents were collected between 1 December 1988 and 24 March 1989 and were assayed for antibody to A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1), A Sichuan/2/87 (H3N2) and B/Beijing/1/87. Analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the antibody profiles of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Six influenza A and 6 influenza B infections were confirmed among the 170 subjects with upper respiratory tract infections. Influenza vaccination was not associated with significant levels of protection against influenza A or B. Studies of the haemagglutinins of the vaccine strains and influenza isolates during 1988/89 showed that they were closely related.","NICHOLSON, K. G.; BAKER, D.

Nevertheless, the conclusive evidence of the benefit of such a strategy is still lacking.We might wonder, with regards to experimental works and recent noninterventional studies, about the risk of a control strategy on an ongoing infectious process, the patient’s outcome, and the safety of the means implemented to obtain temperature control. On the other hand, it is also demonstrated that fever increases oxygen consumption, which may lead in some clinical situations to tissular ischemia and that fever may be associated with a deleterious focal inflammatory process. Methods to control the temperature include external and/or internal cooling and/or antipyretic medications such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. In septic patients, external cooling and paracetamol are the mains means used to control temperature. Despite the uncertainties about the benefit to control or not the temperature, it could be stated that extreme temperature (hypo- or hyperthermia) should be avoided and that the benefit/risk of temperature control must be individually weighted.","Seguin, P.; Launey, Y.; Nesseler, N.; Malledant, Y.",Reanimation,536,1

Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 10(4) or 10(3) International Units (U) of rHuIFN-α for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10–10(−3) U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 10(4)–10(2) U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-α/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-(3)H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-α doses of 10(4) U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-α in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (10(6) U/kg), moderate dose (10(4) U/kg), or a relatively low dose (10(2) U/kg) of rHuIFN-α. Cats inoculated with 10(6) U ofrHuIFN-α/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 10(4) or 10(2) U of rHuIFN-α/kg significantly enhanced (P=0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-α given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing.","Weiss, R.C.; Oostrom-Ram, T.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,536,1

Here, in a first step to study this problem theoretically, we analyze mutating pathogens spreading on simple SIR networks with grid-like connectivity. We have in mind the spatial aspect of epidemics, which often advance on transport links between hosts or groups of hosts such as cities or countries. We focus on the case of mutations that enhance an agent’s infection rate. We uncover that the small-world property, i.e., the presence of long-range connections, makes the network very vulnerable, supporting frequent supercritical mutations and bringing the network from disease extinction to full blown epidemic. For very large numbers of long-range links, however, the effect reverses and we find a reduced chance for large outbreaks. We study two cases, one with discrete number of mutational steps and one with a continuous genetic variable, and we analyze various scaling regimes. For the continuous case we derive a Fokker-Planck-like equation for the probability density and solve it for small numbers of shortcuts using the WKB approximation. Our analysis supports the claims that a potentiating mutation in the transmissibility might occur during an epidemic wave and not necessarily before its initiation.","Rüdiger, Sten; Plietzsch, Anton; Sagués, Francesc; Sokolov, Igor M.; Kurths, Jürgen",Sci Rep,536,9

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them. RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT. CONCLUSION: Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.","Paakkala, Antti; Järvenpää, Ritva; Mäkelä, Satu; Huhtala, Heini; Mustonen, Jukka",Eur J Radiol,536,1

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.","Gombold, James L.; Weiss, Susan R.",Microb Pathog,536,9

A rare case of immature gastric teratoma causing fetal hydrops and subsequent ACS is presented. The related pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and the importance of timely recognition and appropriate interventions are highlighted. CASE PRESENTATION: The male patient was born preterm, weighing 3.9 kg., by Cesarean section. Prior prenatal ultrasounds were normal, but a scan done just before delivery had findings indicating polyhydramnios, fetal ascites, and meconium peritonitis. Upon delivery, the patient had respiratory distress, anasarca and a massively distended abdomen. Resuscitation measures, including ventilatory support, were instituted. Imaging studies showed ascites as well as a large, complex intra-abdominal lesion with calcifications. In the succeeding hours, anuria persisted, anasarca worsened, the abdomen became more distended, and inotrope requirements increased. The occurrence of ACS, from what was presumed to be a retroperitoneal teratoma, was therefore considered. Laparotomy was done on the 28th hour of life, with en bloc excision of a massive tumor and attached section of the greater curvature of the stomach. Passage of urine occurred intra-operatively, and the patient was soon after weaned off inotropes and ventilator support. The histopathologic result was immature gastric teratoma. No chemotherapy was given, and the patient’s serum AFP is at normal levels 15 months following surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of a massive intra-abdominal lesion can result in the pathophysiologic continuum of hydrops fetalis and neonatal ACS. The early recognition of such an association can enable appropriate expectant management of similarly affected neonates, including emergent decompression laparotomy.","Caballes, Alvin B.; Dungca, Leona Bettina P.; Uy, Maria Esterlita V.; Torralba, Maria Geraldine C.; Embuscado, Cristina Marie G.",BMC Pediatr,536,9

The data on births and all-cause deaths are adjusted for seasonal and trend effects, and the residual components of the 2 time series coinciding with the timing of peak influenza mortality are examined for these sequelae. Notable findings include: 1) a drop in births in the 3 months following peak mortality; 2) a reversion in births to normal levels occurring 5–7 months after peak mortality; and 3) a steep drop in births occurring 9–10 months after peak mortality. Interpreted in the context of parallel data showing elevated premature births, stillbirths, and maternal mortality during times of peak influenza mortality, these findings suggest that the main impacts of the 1918–1920 influenza on reproduction occurred through: 1) impaired conceptions, possibly due to effects on fertility and behavioral changes; 2) an increase in the preterm delivery rate during the peak of the pandemic; and 3) elevated maternal and fetal mortality, resulting in late-term losses in pregnancy.","Chandra, Siddharth; Christensen, Julia; Mamelund, Svenn-Erik; Paneth, Nigel",Am J Epidemiol,536,3

To analyse the sensitivity and specificity of LUS vs chest X-ray (CXR). METHODS/DESIGN: A 3-year clinical trial. Inclusion criteria: children younger than 18 years old with suspected pneumonia in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Patients will be randomised into two groups: Experimental Group: LUS will be performed as first lung image. Control Group: CXR will be performed as first pulmonary image. Patients will be classified according to the image and the PCT: a) PCT < 1 ng/mL and LUS/CXR are not suggestive of bacterial pneumonia (BN), no antibiotic will be prescribed; b) LUS/CXR are suggestive of BN, regardless of the PCT, antibiotic therapy is recommended; c) LUS/CXR is not suggestive of BN and PCT > 1 ng/mL, antibiotic therapy is recommended.

While no drugs have yet been approved to treat this disease, small molecules effective against other viral infections are under clinical evaluation for therapeutic abatement of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ongoing clinical trials include Kaletra (a combination of two protease inhibitors approved for HIV treatment), remdesivir (an investigational drug targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP] of SARS-CoV-2), and hydroxychloroquine (an approved anti-malarial and immuno-modulatory drug). Since SARS-CoV-2 replication depends on three virally encoded proteins (RdRP, papain-like proteinase, and helicase), we screened 54 FDA-approved antiviral drugs and ~3300 investigational drugs for binding to these proteins using targeted and unbiased docking simulations and computational modeling. Elbasvir, a drug approved for treating hepatitis C, is predicted to bind stably and preferentially to all three proteins. At the therapeutic dosage, elbasvir has low toxicity (liver enzymes transiently elevated in 1% of subjects) and well-characterized drug-drug interactions. We predict that treatment with elbasvir, alone or in combination with other drugs such as grazoprevir, could efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The concerted action of elbasvir on at least three targets essential for viral replication renders viral mutation to drug resistance extremely unlikely.","Balasubramaniam, Meenakshisundaram; Reis, Robert J.

We examined the clinical data from patients with CPE infections and their outcomes, concentrating on Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. We analysed the clinical information, performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and conducted molecular epidemiological and genomic analyses on the isolates to identify patterns in the data. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of 33 hospitalised patients with confirmed CPE, including patient-related factors associated with the development of CPE infections, were examined. Patients were divided according to whether they were “colonised” or “infected” with CPE and by the timing and frequency of their rectal swab collections, from which 45 swabs were randomly selected for analysis. CPE isolates were purified, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Whole genome sequences of these isolates were determined and analysed to compute bacterial multilocus sequence types and plasmid replicon types, infer phylogenetic relationships, and identify antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. RESULTS: Altogether, 88.9% (40/45) of the CPE isolates were K. pneumoniae. The most abundant carbapenemase gene family in the K. pneumoniae isolates (33/39) was bla(OXA-232), with bla(NDM-1) additionally identified in 19 of them. All CPE isolates carrying either bla(OXA-232) or bla(NDM-1) were resistant to meropenem, but only 40 from 45 were susceptible to colistin. Among the CPE-infected patients (n = 18) and CPE-colonised patients who developed CPE infections during the study (n = 3), all but one received standard colistin-based combination therapy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the polyclonal spread of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CPKP) within the patient population, with the following two major subclades identified: ST16 (n = 15) and ST231 (n = 14). CPKP-ST231 had the highest virulence score of 4 and was associated with primary bacteraemia. The siderophores yersiniabactin and aerobactin, considered to be important virulence factors, were only identified in the CPKP-ST231 genomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed the genomic features of colonising CPE isolates, focusing on antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants. This type of multi-layered analysis can be further exploited in Thailand and elsewhere to modify the regimes used for empirical antibiotic treatment and improve the management strategies for CPE infections in hospitalised patients.

This study investigates the effects of a 9-month PA intervention on physiological characteristics and motor and cognitive skills in preschool children. (2) Methods: Preschool children (n = 132; age 4 to 7 years) attending regular preschool programs were nonrandomly assigned to PA intervention (n = 66; 60 min sessions twice per week) or a control group (n = 66; no additional organized PA program) for 9 months. Exercise training for the intervention group included various sports games, outdoor activities, martial arts, yoga, and dance. Anthropometry, motor skills (7 tests), and cognitive skills (Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices and Cognitive Assessment System) were assessed before and after an intervention period in both groups. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. (3) Results: Body weight significantly increased in both groups over time. Compared to the changes observed in the control group, the intervention group significantly increased in chest circumference (p = 0.022). In contrast, the control group demonstrated an increase in waist circumference (p = 0.001), while these measures in the intervention group remained stable. Participants in the intervention group improved running speed (p = 0.016) and standing broad jump (p = 0.000).

In order to study the presence of donor lymphocytes in the neonates peripheral blood, chromosome studies were performed immediately after,12 and 72 hours following the exchange transfusion. We used the fluorescent-binding technique in order to distinguish the donor's cells by the presence of the γ-chromosone or other fluorescent markers in at least 300 mitotic figures in each speciment. We found that in jaundiced babies immediately following exchange transfusion less than 10% of the lymphocytes came from the donor and 12 hours later only 1-2% were still present.However in neonates exchange-transfusion for septicaemia the percentage of donor's lymphocytes immediately following the proceedure sometimes reached 50% and dropped to less than 10% by 12 hours.This shows the inability of the depressed by the infection host defence mechanisms of the newborn to deal with the donor's lymphocytes.","Xanthou, M; Mandyla, H; Berietou, M; Metaxotou, C",Pediatr Res,536,3

It formulates its analysis in terms of the concept of reflexivity, drawing on the ideas regarding reflexivity in financial markets of George Soros, and lays out a model of how a financial cycle expresses a systematic pattern of interacting feedback effects. The paper develops this analysis as a complex interaction between sets of heterogeneous expectations derived from the behavior of reflexive economic agents. Positive and negative feedback phases in a cycle are distinguished and associated with boom and bust stages of that cycle. A central role is played by agents’ beliefs and judgments underlying their expectations, and how those beliefs and judgments in uncertain circumstances are changeable and subject to abrupt reversals which can manifest themselves in “Minsky moments.” The paper argues that agents’ belief reversals result from their misconceptions about causal processes in booms and upswings, a misconception that reflects their tendency to think causally in terms of negative feedback patterns rather than positive ones.","Davis, John",Rev Evol Polit Econ,536,9

However, the effect of chronic opioid exposure on minimum alveolar concentration of inhalation agents remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the concentration of sevoflurane necessary to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) <50 (SEVOBIS50) in patients with chronic opioid use compared with those naïve to opioid use. METHODS We included chronic opioid users who received a stable dose of oral morphine of at least 60 mg/d according to the morphine equivalent daily dose for at least 4 weeks and opioid-naïve patients. General anesthesia that included thiopental, vecuronium, and sevoflurane in oxygen was administered to all patients. Anesthesia was maintained using predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. Fifteen minutes after achieving the determined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration through closed circuit anesthesia, BIS was measured for 1 minute in both groups. SEVOBIS50 was determined using Dixon's up-down method and probit analysis. RESULTS Nineteen and 18 patients from the chronic opioid and control groups, respectively, were included in the final analysis. SEVOBIS50values for the chronic opioid and control patients were 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.11) and 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.40), respectively (P = .0346). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane necessary to maintain a BIS <50 is lower for chronic opioid users than for opioid-naïve patients.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Eom, Woosik; Yim, Jiyeon; Kim, Namwoo; Kwon, Kyungho; Kim, Seong-Eun; Kim, Dae Hyun",Anesthesia and analgesia,536,16

DESIGN Qualitative semistructured interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS There were two groups of interviewees: Research-active nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, healthcare scientists, psychologists and pharmacists (NMAHPPs) and managers of these professions. All participants were employed in a single, multisite healthcare organisation in the UK. ANALYSIS Interview transcripts were analysed using the framework method to identify key themes, subthemes and areas of divergence. RESULTS Four themes were identified. The first, cultural shifts, described the perceived improvements in the approach to patient care and research culture that were associated with clinical academic activity. The second theme explored visibility and included the positive reputation that clinical academics were identified as bringing to the organisation in contrast with perceived levels of invisibility and inaccessibility of these roles. The third theme identified the impacts of the clinical academic pathways, including the precarity of these roles. The final theme explored making impact tangible, and described interviewees' suggestions of possible methods to record and demonstrate impact. CONCLUSIONS Perceived positive impacts of NMAHPP clinical academic activity focused on interlinked positive changes for patients and clinical teams. This included delivery of evidence-based healthcare, patient involvement in clinical decision making and improved staff recruitment and retention. However, the positive impacts of clinical academic activity often centred around individual clinicians and did not necessarily translate throughout the organisation. The current clinical academic pathway was identified as causing tension between the perceived value of clinical academic activity and the need to find sufficient staffing to cover clinical services.","Newington, Lisa; Alexander, Caroline M; Wells, Mary",BMJ open,536,1

OBJECTIVES We aimed to examine whether COVID-19 had an impact on access to PD medication by region and income. METHODS This study was conducted as part of a survey sent to members of the Movement Disorders Society focusing on access to PD medication globally. RESULTS Of 346 responses, 157 (45.4%) agreed that COVID-19 had affected access to PD medication. 22.8% of high income and 88.9% of low-income countries' respondents agreed that access to PD medication was affected by COVID-19. 59% of 'yes' respondents reported increased disability of patients as an impact. CONCLUSIONS Access to PD medication is likely to have been affected by COVID-19 and result in deterioration of patients' symptomatic control.

It has been suggested that cannabis could generate blurred vision during reading tasks. The goal of this study was to objectively assess the acute effects of smoking cannabis on the dynamics of ocular accommodation. The influence of other factors, including target distance and the direction of accommodation, as well as personal characteristics, were also analysed. METHODS Nineteen young people who were occasional cannabis users participated in the study (mean age 22.53 [3.12] years). Their usage profiles were evaluated by means of the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test-revised (CUDIT-r). The dynamics of the accommodative response were evaluated using an open-field auto refractor (Grand Seiko WAM-5500). The participants completed two different experimental sessions, one week apart, and in random order (baseline session and after smoking cannabis). During these sessions, the amplitude of the response (D), mean velocity (D/s), peak velocity (D/s), response time (s), accommodative lag (D) and accommodation variability (D) were measured. RESULTS The results indicated that cannabis use had a significant main effect on the mean accommodation/disaccommodation velocity (F1,13 = 7.21; p = 0.02; η p 2 = 0.396). Cannabis consumption also interacted significantly with other factors. Response time showed a significant two-way interaction between condition × target distance (F1,13 = 11.71; p = 0.005; η p 2 = 0.474) and condition × accommodation direction (F1,13 = 8.71; p = 0.01; η p 2 = 0.401). For mean velocity, two-way interactions were found between condition × age (F1,13 = 6.03; p = 0.03; η p 2 = 0.354), condition × CUDIT-r score (F1,13 = 6.03; p = 0.03; η p 2 = 0.356) and condition × target distance (F1,13 = 7.20; p = 0.02; η p 2 = 0.396). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that cannabis use can alter the accommodation process, although further studies should be carried out to explore the role of attention deficits. According to these results, certain daily activities that depend on an accurate accommodative function may be affected by cannabis use.","Ortiz-Peregrina, Sonia; Ortiz, Carolina; Martino, Franceso; Castro-Torres, José J; Anera, Rosario G",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,536,1

Several studies have shown a higher incidence of COVID-19, as well as related poor outcomes in patients with malignancies as compared with those without them (Liang et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). The impact of cancer on COVID-19 may be attri‑buted to the use of antitumor treatments that may disturb the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wang et al., 2020), while the current studies on this topic have drawn controversial conclusions. Some implied that anticancer treatments might elevate the risk of death (García-Suárez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). On the contrary, others pointed out that this association is not significant (Brar et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020a). Although previous systematic reviews have investigated this important issue (Wang and Huang, 2020), the heterogeneity of findings is obvious and the general conclusion has remained unclear. Considering this ambiguity, it is difficult for clinicians to make therapeutic decisions when facing patients with both cancer and COVID-19; therefore, a high-quality and accurate evaluation of the impact of anticancer treatments on COVID-19 patients is necessary. Accordingly, we conducted a pooled analysis with the original data of each patient for the first time to provide a comprehensive perspective into the association between anticancer regimens and the outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19.","Lu, Haohua; Shi, Yu; Chen, Kelie; Chen, Zhi; Zhu, Haihong; Niu, Yuequn; Xia, Dajing; Wu, Yihua",Journal of Zhejiang University.

The aim of this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis was to compare the effect of nasal and oronasal masks on treatment efficacy and adherence in patients with COPD and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). METHODS We searched Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 1 month's duration, published between January 1994 and April 2019, that assessed NIV efficacy in patients with OHS and COPD. The main outcomes were diurnal PaCO2, PaO2 and NIV adherence (PROSPERO CRD42019132398). FINDINGS Of 1576 articles identified, 34 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and IPD were obtained for 18. Ten RCTs were excluded because only one type of mask was used, or mask data were missing. Data from 8 RCTs, including 290 IPD, underwent meta-analysis. Oronasal masks were used in 86% of cases. There were no differences between oronasal and nasal masks for PaCO2 (0.61 mm Hg (95% CI -2.15 to 3.38); p=0.68), PaO2 (-0.00 mm Hg (95% CI -4.59 to 4.58); p=1) or NIV adherence (0·29 hour/day (95% CI -0.74 to 1.32); p=0.58). There was no interaction between the underlying pathology and the effect of mask type on any outcome. INTERPRETATION Oronasal masks are the most used interface for the delivery of home NIV in patients with OHS and COPD; however, there is no difference in the efficacy or tolerance of oronasal or nasal masks.","Lebret, Marius; Léotard, Antoine; Pépin, Jean Louis; Windisch, Wolfram; Ekkernkamp, Emelie; Pallero, Mercedes; Sánchez-Quiroga, M-Ángeles; Hart, Nicholas; Kelly, Julia L; Patout, Maxime; Funk, Georg Chistian; Duiverman, Marieke L; Masa, Juan F; Simonds, Anita; Murphy, Patrick Brian; Wijkstra, Peter J; Dreher, Michael; Storre, Jan; Khouri, Charles; Borel, Jean-Christian",Thorax,536,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cancer registry data were reviewed from 2005-2014. Inclusion criteria included HPC, clinical N1-3 disease (AJCC staging system, 7th edition), and receiving radiotherapy. Patients with M1 diseaseor with synchronous/metachronous cancer were excluded. Staging images were reviewed by two radiologists. rENE was defined as infiltration of adjacent fat/muscles, irregular nodal surface, or irregular capsular enhancement. Clinical stage, rENE status, and clinical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 355 patients were included. Patients with rENE had lower 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. Univariate analysis showed that clinical T4 or N3 stage, overall stage IV, and rENE correlated with OS and RFS. In multivariate analysis, clinical T4 or N3 stage correlated with poor OS, while clinical T4 or N3 stage and rENE were independent predictors of poor RFS. N1/2 without rENE was designated as Group 1, N1/2 with rENE as Group 2, and N3 with/without rENE as Group 3. The 3-year RFS rates in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 55.8%, 41.0%, and 29.3%, respectively. The 3-year RFS rate in Group 1 was significantly higher than that in the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS rENE is an adverse prognostic factor for survival in patients with HPC treated with primary chemoradiation. It correlated with inferior RFS regardless of N stage. rENE may be used as a criterion for clinical ENE in future staging systems.","Fan, Kang-Hsing; Yeh, Chih-Hua; Hung, Sheng-Ping; Kang, Chung-Jan; Huang, Shiang-Fu; Chang, Kai-Ping; Wang, Hung-Ming; Chia-Hsun Hsieh, Jason; Lin, Chien-Yu; Cheng, Ann-Joy; Ng, Shu-Hang; Tung-Chieh Chang, Joseph",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,536,7

In 2013, no dedicated pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) programs existed in Ethiopia despite the estimated annual incidence of 6000-8000 cases. The Aslan Project initiative was established to fill this gap in order to improve pediatric cancer care in Ethiopia. A major objective was to increase subspecialty PHO-trained physicians who were committed to practicing locally and empowered to lead programmatic development. METHODS We designed and implemented a PHO training curriculum to provide a robust educational and clinical experience within the existing resource-constrained environment in Ethiopia. Education relied on visiting PHO faculty, a training attachment abroad, and extraordinary initiative from trainees. RESULTS Four physicians have completed comprehensive PHO subspecialty training based primarily in Ethiopia, and all have remained local. Former fellows are now leading two PHO centers in Ethiopia with a combined capacity of 64 inpatient beds and over 800 new diagnoses per year; an additional former fellow is developing a pediatric cancer program in Nairobi, Kenya. Two fellows currently are in training. Program leadership, teaching, and advocacy are being transitioned to these physicians. CONCLUSIONS Despite myriad challenges, a subspecialty PHO training program was successfully implemented in a low-income country. PHO training in Ethiopia is approaching sustainability through human resource development, and is accelerating the growth of dedicated PHO services where none existed 7 years ago.","Hailu, Daniel; Fufu Hordofa, Diriba; Adam Endalew, Haileyesus; Karimi Mutua, Doreen; Bekele, Wondwessen; Bonilla, Miguel; Çeliker, Mahmut Yasar; Challinor, Julia; Dotan, Amit; Habashy, Catherine; Kumar, Prasanna N; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Wali, Rabia Muhammad; Weitzman, Sheila; Broas, Julie; Korones, David N; Alexander, Thomas B; Shad, Aziza T",Pediatric blood & cancer,536,24

We report that Unc51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1/Unc51.1) is a pivotal regulator of PHEV-induced neurological disorders and functions to selectively control the initiation of nerve growth factor (NGF)/TrkA endosome trafficking. We first identified the function of Ulk1 by histopathologic evaluation in a PHEV-infected mouse model in which neuronal loss was accompanied by the suppression of Ulk1 expression. Morphogenesis assessments in the primary cortical neurons revealed that overexpression or mutations of Ulk1 modulated neurite outgrowth, collateral sprouting, and endosomal transport. Likewise, Ulk1 expression was decreased following PHEV infection, suggesting that there was a correlation between the neurodegeneration and functional Ulk1 deficiency. We then showed that Ulk1 forms a multiprotein complex with TrkA and the early endosome marker Rab5 and that Ulk1 defects lead to either blocking of NGF/TrkA endocytosis or premature degradation of pTrkA via constitutive activation of the Rab5 GTPase. Further investigation determined that the ectopic expression of Rab5 mutants induces aberrant endosomal accumulation of activated pTrkA, proving that targeting of Ulk1-TrkA-NGF signaling to the retrograde transport route in the neurodegenerative process that underlies PHEV infection is dependent on Rab5 GTPase activity. Therefore, we described a long-distance signaling mechanism of PHEV-driven deficits in neurons and suggested that such Ulk1 repression may result in limited NGF/TrkA retrograde signaling within activated Rab5 endosomes, explaining the progressive failure of neurite outgrowth and survival.IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a neurotropic coronavirus and targets neurons in the nervous system for proliferation, frequently leaving behind grievous neurodegeneration. Structural plasticity disorders occur in the axons, dendrites, and dendritic spines of PHEV-infected neurons, and dysfunction of this neural process may contribute to neurologic pathologies, but the mechanisms remain undetermined. Further understanding of the neurological manifestations underlying PHEV infection in the CNS may provide insights into both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases that may be conducive to targeted approaches for treatment. The significance of our research is in identifying an Ulk1-related neurodegenerative mechanism, focusing on the regulatory functions of Ulk1 in the transport of long-distance trophic signaling endosomes, thereby explaining the progressive failure of neurite outgrowth and survival associated with PHEV aggression. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from endocytic pathways and the neuropathogenesis of PHEV-induced CNS disease.","Li, Zi; Zhao, Kui; Lv, Xiaoling; Lan, Yungang; Hu, Shiyu; Shi, Junchao; Guan, Jiyu; Yang, Yawen; Lu, Huijun; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Journal of virology,536,31

In recent years, the discovery of a new peptide editor for MHC-I has added an extra level of complexity in our understanding of how peptide presentation is regulated. On top of this, the incredible diversity in MHC-I molecules leads to significant variation in the interaction between MHC-I and components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. Here, we review our current understanding regarding how polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen class I molecules influence their interactions with key components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway. A deeper understanding of this may offer new insights regarding how apparently subtle variation in MHC-I can have a significant impact on susceptibility to disease.","Aflalo, Aure; Boyle, Louise H",International journal of immunogenetics,536,1

Our study aims to update the medical evidence from controlled observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCT) on the use of TCZ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS We searched the following databases from January 1, 2020 to April 13, 2021 (date of the last search): MEDLINE database through the PubMed search engine and Scopus, using the terms (""COVID-19"" [Supplementary Concept]) AND ""tocilizumab"" [Supplementary Concept]). RESULTS 64 studies were included in the present study, 54 were controlled observational studies (50 retrospective and 4 prospective) and 10 were RCT. The overall results provided data from 20,616 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: 7,668 patients received TCZ in addition to standard of care (SOC) (including 1,915 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with reported mortality), and 12,948 patients only receiving SOC (including 4,410 patients admitted to ICU with reported mortality). After applying the random-effects model, hospital-wide (including ICU) pooled mortality odds ratio (OR) of patients with COVID-19 treated with TCZ was 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.56-0.93). The pooled hospital-wide mortality OR was 1.25 (95% CI = 0.74-2.18) in patients admitted at conventional wards versus 0.66 (95% CI = 0.59-0.76) in patients admitted to the ICU. The pooled OR of hospital-wide mortality (including ICU) of COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ plus corticosteroids (CS) was 0.67 (95% CI = 0.54-0.84). The pooled in-hospital mortality OR was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.35-1.42) when TCZ was early administered (≤10 days from symptom onset) versus 0.83 (95% CI 0.48-1.45) for late administration (>10 days from symptom onset). The meta-analysis did not find significantly higher risk for secondary infections in COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ. CONCLUSIONS TCZ prevented mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This benefit was seen to a greater extent in patients receiving concomitant CS and when TCZ administration occurred within the first 10 days after symptom onset.","Rubio-Rivas, Manuel; Forero, Carlos G; Mora-Luján, Jose María; Montero, Abelardo; Formiga, Francesc; Homs, Narcís A; Albà-Albalate, Joan; Sánchez, Laura; Rello, Jordi; Corbella, Xavier",Pharmacotherapy,536,28

In this territory-wide molecular epidemiology study involving 3,137 mammals and 3,298 birds, we discovered seven additional novel deltacoronaviruses in pigs and birds, which we named porcine coronavirus HKU15, white-eye coronavirus HKU16, sparrow coronavirus HKU17, magpie robin coronavirus HKU18, night heron coronavirus HKU19, wigeon coronavirus HKU20, and common moorhen coronavirus HKU21. Complete genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that the avian and mammalian deltacoronaviruses have similar genome characteristics and structures. They all have relatively small genomes (25.421 to 26.674 kb), the smallest among all coronaviruses. They all have a single papain-like protease domain in the nsp3 gene; an accessory gene, NS6 open reading frame (ORF), located between the M and N genes; and a variable number of accessory genes (up to four) downstream of the N gene. Moreover, they all have the same putative transcription regulatory sequence of ACACCA. Molecular clock analysis showed that the most recent common ancestor of all coronaviruses was estimated at approximately 8100 BC, and those of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus were at approximately 2400 BC, 3300 BC, 2800 BC, and 3000 BC, respectively. From our studies, it appears that bats and birds, the warm blooded flying vertebrates, are ideal hosts for the coronavirus gene source, bats for Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and birds for Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, to fuel coronavirus evolution and dissemination.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Lam, Carol S F; Lau, Candy C Y; Tsang, Alan K L; Lau, John H N; Bai, Ru; Teng, Jade L L; Tsang, Chris C C; Wang, Ming; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,536,1

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","Belhadjer, Zahra; Méot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Maëlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Benoît; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien",Circulation,536,1

The aim was to assess the importance of the choice of the most adequate calculation modality, providing recommendations about the choice of the computation tool. METHODS The performances were evaluated both on phantoms and patients in a multi-level approach. Different phantoms filled with a 177Lu-radioactive solution were used: a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, a phantom with organ-shaped inserts and two cylindrical phantoms with inserts different for shape and volume. A total of 70 patients with NETs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS The comparisons were performed mainly between the mean values of the absorbed dose in the regions of interest. A general better agreement was obtained between Dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations results rather than between either of these two and organ-level dosimetry, both for phantoms and patients. Phantoms measurements also showed the discrepancies mainly depend on the geometry of the inserts (e.g. shape and volume). For patients, differences were more pronounced than phantoms and higher inter/intra patient variability was observed. CONCLUSION This study suggests that voxel-level techniques for dosimetry calculation are potentially more accurate and personalized than organ-level methods. In particular, a voxel-convolution method provides good results in a short time of calculation, while Monte Carlo based computation should be conducted with very fast calculation systems for a possible use in clinics, despite its intrinsic higher accuracy. Attention to the calculation modality is recommended in case of clinical regions of interest with irregular shape and far from spherical geometry, in which Monte Carlo seems to be more accurate than voxel-convolution methods.","Finocchiaro, Domenico; Berenato, Salvatore; Bertolini, Valentina; Castellani, Gastone; Lanconelli, Nico; Versari, Annibale; Spezi, Emiliano; Iori, Mauro; Fioroni, Federica; Grassi, Elisa",PloS one,536,16

Although significant efforts have been made to advance our understanding of this important phylum, still little is known about how members of the cyanobacteria affect and respond to changes in complex biological systems. This lack of knowledge is in part due to our dependence on pure cultures when determining the metabolism and function of a microorganism. In the work presented here we took advantage of the Culture Collection of Microorganisms from Extreme Environments (CCMEE), a collection of more than 1,000 publicly available photosynthetic co-cultures now maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. To highlight some of their scientific potential, we selected 26 of these photosynthetic co-cultures from the CCMEE for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We assessed if samples readily available from the CCMEE could be used to generate new insights into the role of microbial communities in global and local carbon and nitrogen cycling.

Linking personal medical records with travel and immigration data, for example, will allow the effective management of pandemics such as the current COVID-19 outbreak by tracking potentially infected individuals and their contacts. One major challenge for accurate linkage of large databases is the quadratic or even higher computational complexities of many advanced linkage algorithms. In this paper we present a novel approach that, based on the expected number of true matches between two databases, applies active learning to remove compared record pairs that are likely non-matches before a computationally expensive classification or clustering algorithm is employed to classify record pairs. Unlike blocking and indexing techniques that are used to reduce the number of record pairs to be compared, using recursive binning on a data dimension such as time or space, our approach removes likely non-matching record pairs in each bin after their comparison. Experiments on two real-world databases show that similarity filtering can substantially reduce run time and improve precision, at the costs of a small reduction in recall, of the final linkage results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nanayakkara, C.; Christen, P.; Ranbaduge, T.","25th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, PAKDD 2021",536,16

The treatment of these infections has been hampered by the appearance of resistant strains. This current study aims to investigate the prevalence of Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) infections in Omani patients and their resistance pattern against commonly used antibiotics. Seven hundred and ninety fresh stool samples were obtained from Omani patients attending Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with GI manifestation from the 1st of June to the 30th of November 2019. Bacterial identification in stool samples was carried out by inoculation in culture media, microscopical examination and biochemical tests confirmed by MALDI. BD PhoenixTM. The antibiotics sensitivity testing was carried out by the Manual disk diffusion method and by MALDI. BD PhoenixTM. Out of 790 stool samples, 49 samples were positive for GIT bacterial infections. Salmonella spp. was the most prevalent isolate and more associated with children less than ten years old. Out of the 49 bacterial isolates, 3 (6.1%) were Clostridium difficili, 4 (8.2%) were Shigella flexneri, 5 (10.2%) were Campylobacter jejuni, and different Salmonella spp. serotypes were detected such as Salmonella Kentucky (8.2%), Salmonella enteritidis (6.1%), Salmonella infantis (4.1%), Salmonella welteverden (4.1%), Salmonella typhimurium (4.1%), Salmonella anatum (2.0%), Salmonella tesvia (2.0%), Salmonella Uganda (2.0%), Salmonella Arizona (2.0%) and (40.8%) of other Salmonella spp. serotypes. Eighty percent of isolated Campylobacter jejuni were resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Tetracycline. Salmonella spp. and Shigella flexneri were highly resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, and Cefuroxime. The low level of bacterial infection detected among screened patients in the present study indicates the excellent hand washing hygiene practice in reducing GIT infections among patients in Oman. This good hand washing hygiene practice is of great help in the efforts of controlling the spread of other severe diseases like COVID-19. However, detecting the emerging of antibiotic-resistant of GIT bacterial pathogens among patients in Oman, such as Salmonella and Shigella to a commonly used antibiotic such as Gentamicin, is alarming.

Methods: This phase 2, non-randomized, single-arm, openlabel study (NCT03499353) evaluated the efficacy and safety of TALA in the neoadjuvant setting for pts with early gBRCA1/2-mutated HER2- BC. Primary endpoint was evaluation of pathologic complete response (pCR) as assessed by Independent Central Review (ICR) after completing 24 weeks of neoadjuvant TALA monotherapy 1 mg QD (0.75 mg for moderate renal impairment) followed by surgery. Secondary endpoints included pCR by investigator (INV) and residual cancer burden (RCB) by ICR (RCB: 0 [pCR], I [minimal], II [moderate], III [extensive]). The evaluable population included pts who received at least 80% of the TALA dose prescribed at treatment start and underwent breast surgery and pCR assessment, plus those who progressed before pCR could be assessed. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all pts who received at least 1 dose of TALA. Results: Of 61 pts treated with TALA (ITT and safety populations), 48 comprised the evaluable population. All pts had triplenegative BC. 60 pts had adenocarcinoma and 1 had squamous cell histology, with the following staging: I=20, II=27, III=14. Mean age was 44.6 years, mean duration of 4.5 wks since disease onset, mean duration of treatment of 23.3 wks, and mean overall relative dose intensity of 84.5% (ITT population). pCR (assessed by ICR and INV) and RCB (by ICR) for the evaluable and ITT populations are shown in the table below.

Through online self-report questionnaires, we aimed to discover the psychological effects of the pandemic and its associated risk factors for developing mental health symptoms in young people. We disseminated a mental health survey through online social media, WeChat, and QQ in the five Chinese provinces with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the late stage of the country-wide lockdown. We used a self-made questionnaire that queried children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 on demographic information, psychological status, and other lifestyle and COVID-related variables. A total of 17,740 children and adolescents with valid survey data participated in the study. 10,022 (56.5%), 11,611 (65.5%), 10,697 (60.3%), 6,868 (38.7%), and 6,225 (35.1%) participants presented, respectively, more depressive, anxious, compulsive, inattentive, and sleep-related problems compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. High school students reported a greater change in depression and anxiety than did middle school and primary school students. Despite the fact that very few children (0.1%) or their family members (0.1%) contracted the virus in this study, the psychological impact of the pandemic was clearly profound. Fathers'anxiety appeared to have the strongest influence on a children's psychological symptoms, explaining about 33% of variation in the child's overall symptoms. Other factors only explained less than 2% of the variance in symptoms once parents'anxiety was accounted for. The spread of COVID-19 significantly influenced the psychological state of children and adolescents. It is clear that children and adolescents, particularly older adolescents, need mental health support during the pandemic. The risk factors we uncovered suggest that reducing fathers'anxiety is particularly critical to addressing young people's mental health disorders in this time.","Ma, J.; Ding, J.; Hu, J.; Wang, K.; Xiao, S.; Luo, T.; Yu, S.; Liu, C.; Xu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Wang, C.; Guo, S.; Yang, X.; Song, H.; Geng, Y.; Jin, Y.; Chen, H.",,536,1

VOCs are characterized by increased transmissibility, increased virulence, or reduced neutralization by antibodies obtained from prior infection or vaccination. Tracking the introduction and transmission of VOCs relies on sequencing, typically whole-genome sequencing of clinical samples. Wastewater surveillance is increasingly used to track the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants through sequencing approaches. Here, we adapt and apply a rapid, high-throughput method for detection and quantification of the frequency of two deletions characteristic of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 VOCs in wastewater. We further develop a statistical approach to analyze temporal dynamics in drop-off RT-dPCR assay data to quantify transmission fitness advantage, providing data similar to that obtained from clinical samples. Digital PCR assays targeting signature mutations in wastewater offer near real-time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and potentially earlier detection and inference on transmission fitness advantage than clinical sequencing.","Caduff, L.; Dreifuss, D.; Schindler, T.; Devaux, A.

As nursing education programs and healthcare providers struggle to meet the care needs of their respective communities, the ever-present challenge of replenishing nursing candidates persists--particularly when those candidates face financial hardships to complete their education. In an effort to mitigate financial hardships, competency-based education (CBE) nursing offers the opportunity for students to self-pace their learning and potentially complete their education more quickly. In addition to CBE programs typically being more affordable that traditional ""seat time"" credit-based programs, students can potentially yield even more significant savings. Therefore, considering some healthcare providers, accreditors, and candidates may be concerned with CBE program quality, this study assesses the merit of that assertion. Through a comparative of analysis of Western Governors University's (WGU) CBE Nursing Program to similar traditional education state nursing programs, this research finds that CBE nursing programs can reduce cost while maintaining or even improving program quality by a measure of NCLEX pass rates.","Hossler, Chuck James Alton",Journal of Competency-Based Education,536,17

Recent data from clinical trial suggest that antibody cocktail therapy, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, has been shown to rapidly reduce the viral load and markedly decrease the risk of hospitalization or death among high-risk patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, it remains unclear how effective in a real-life clinical setting the therapy is. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed mild to moderate Covid-19 patients with one or more high-risk factors for severe disease who consecutively underwent the antibody cocktail therapy of the disease in our institute in June 2021 through early September 2021, compared to those with high-risk factors who were isolated in non-medical facilities consecutively during the same period, thereby being not given the antibody cocktail therapy there. The key outcome was the percentage of patients with Covid-19-related deterioration which needed additional medical interventions, such as oxygen support or other antiviral therapies. Results. Data from 55 patients with initially receiving antibody cocktail therapy and 53 patients with isolation into non-medical facilities are analyzed. 22 (41.5 %) of 53 patients with isolation facilities were finally hospitalized to receive medical interventions. On the other hand, 13 (23.6 %) of 55 patients with antibody cocktail therapy in our hospital subsequently underwent further medical interventions because of the progression. In multivariate analysis with variables of age, BMI, and high-risk factors, the antibody cocktail therapy significantly reduced 70 % in the need for further medical interventions compared to the initial isolation in the non-medical facilities (odds ratio=0.30, 95%CI [0.10-0.87], p=0.027). Furthermore, patients with 96% or above of SPO2 were significantly more favorable for the therapy than those with 95% or below of SPO2. Conclusion. The treatment of antibody cocktail was closely linked to reduction in the need for further medical interventions. The result indicates that the antibody cocktail therapy is associated with reducing the strain on hospitals, which is related to the improvement of medical management for public health care in Covid-19 pandemic era.","Kakinoki, Y.; Yamada, K.; Tanino, Y.; Suzuki, K.; Ichikawa, T.; Nakamura, A.; Kukita, S.; Uehara, A.; Saito, S.; Kuroda, S.; Sakagami, H.; Nagashima, Y.; Takahashi, K.; Suzuki, S.",,536,17

Their interface and areas of overlap have mostly been shaped by theoretical positions broadly considered “social constructionist.” Taken together, these perspectives provide empirical and theoretical tools to analyze important questions about how social inequalities, forms of scientific knowledge, and patterns of human health come to be produced and feedback into one another. Examining their intersection enables sociological questions such as: How is medical and public health scientific knowledge produced, stabilized, and taken as fact? How are scientific facts about health and illness used, experienced, and challenged? What is the relationship between health inequalities and public health or medical knowledge? This article seeks to briefly trace the important contributions that social constructionist research has made at the interstices of medical sociology and STS, further clarifying the history, points of intersection, and areas of diversion between them. The current COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled the political struggles that constitute public health scientific knowledge and circulation.

We investigated whether COVID-19 vaccination affects the production of anti-PF4 immunoglobulins detectable by solid-phase assay in aPL-positive patients and their ability to induce in vitro platelet activation. Anti-PF4 were found in 9/126 aPL-positive patients, 4/50 COVID-19, 9/49 other infections, and 1/50 aPL-negative systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Clinical manifestations of TTS were not observed in any aPL patient positive for anti-PF4, whose sera failed to cause platelet aggregations. The administration of COVID-19 vaccines did not affect the production of anti-PF4 immunoglobulins or their ability to cause platelet aggregation in 44 aPL-positive patients tested before and after vaccination.

Research ethics guidelines highlight the need for protection of vulnerable participants, and clinical trials are ruled by ethical and legal principles that concern possible health inequities experienced by vulnerable populations. In both the literature and the regulation, two conceptions of vulnerability are at work. On the one hand, the inherent vulnerability that is part of the human condition;on the other hand, the situational vulnerability that is associated with specific contextual factors, and that point out either a reduced autonomy or a greater risk of harms for individuals belonging to some groups. Both these two conceptions of vulnerability are exacerbated during a pandemic;on the one hand, specific populations are at heightened risk for medical complications from the virus (elderly, or immunodepressed);on the other hand, specific groups experience an increased vulnerability due to the social determinants of health, which influence individual resilience and exacerbate the impact of the virus. Among the many (income distribution, education and literacy, working condition, house and living conditions, disability, access to health services, etc.) the dramatic reduction of the space for free and informed consent, because of the mental and physical adverse effects coming from social isolation, age, culture, literacy, is relevant for both clinical research and practice.

However, to know if the current path taken by a pedestrians will lead to crowded locations requires realtime, up-to-date information on the density of pedestrians in the local area. Utilizing this, pedestrians (i.e. route recommending applications) could avoid crowded areas thus mitigating or reducing exposure risks. State-of-the art system relying on centralized backend services do not provide necessary realtime information and might lead to privacy concerns.In this paper, we propose an alternative, decentralized approach to disseminate Decentralized Pedestrian Density (DPD) maps which provide realtime density data in close to medium proximity. The DPD map is based on merging and aggregating position beacons into density measures disseminated by each pedestrian. We use LTE Advanced sidelink multicast communication to disseminate beacons and DPD maps. To evaluate our approach, we simulate an urban scenario modelling a small/medium area located within the city center of Munich, Germany. This requires a realistic modelling of the pedestrians movements and of the communication system. Therefore, we make use of the open-source simulation framework CrowNet, maintained at our group which couples the microscopic pedestrian dynamics simulator Vadere with a system-level simulation of LTE-A (SimuLTE model in OMNeT++).Initial results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach but also indicate that overload situations can lead to the dissemination of outdated information, implying a need for situation- and load-adaptive transmission schemes. © 2021 IEEE.","Schuhback, S.; Wischhof, L.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops, ICC Workshops 2021",536,1

We find that COVID-19 stress is significantly negatively related to life satisfaction, and that this association is strongest among those living alone and those living in households with many other adults. Exploratory analyses suggest that shopping challenges are most strongly associated directly with stress and indirectly with life satisfaction, while income and boredom challenges are less important.

From biochemical and morphological lines of evidence, we have proposed that Sec12p is localized to the ER by two mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi compartment. We have also shown that Rer1p, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Sec12p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rer1p. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rer1p. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there. From these observations, we conclude that the TMD mainly acts as the retrieval signal and the cytoplasmic domain contains the retention signal.

Around 75% of all CAP diagnosed are treated in the Emergency Department (ED). The CAP represents the main cause for sepsis and septic shock in ED, and the most frequent cause of death and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to infectious disease. Overall mortality is 10-14% according to age and associated risk factors. Forty to 60% of CAP will require hospital admission, including observation units (with very variable ranges from 22-65% according to centers, seasonal of the year and patients´ characteristics). Between the admissions, 2-10% will be in the ICU. All of previously mentioned reflects the importance of the CAP in the ED, as well as the “impact of the emergency care on the patient with CAP”, as it is the establishment where the initial, but key decisions, are made and could condition the outcome of the illness. It is known the great variability among physicians in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CAP, which is one of the reasons that explains the great differences in the admission rates, achievement of the microbiological diagnosis, request for complementary studies, the choice of antimicrobial treatment, or the diversity of applied care. In this sense, the implementation of clinical practice guidelines with the use of the severity scores and the new tools available, such as biomarkers, can improve patient care with CAP in ED. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of emergency professionals and specialists involved in the care process of CAP has designed a guideline with several recommendations for decisions-making during the key moments in patients with CAP attended in the ED.","Julián-Jiménez, Agustín; Valero, Inmaculada Adán; López, Alicia Beteta; Martín, Luis Miguel Cano; Rodríguez, Olga Fernández; Díaz, Rafael Rubio; Berrocal, Mª Antonia Sepúlveda; del Castillo, Juan González; González, Francisco Javier Candel",Rev Esp Quimioter,536,16

As the potential recipients are continuously increasing in number, a donor programme which satisfies this demand is mandatory. Improvements in cryopreservation techniques, like oocyte and embryo vitrification, have led to the overcoming of the sequence of stimulation-retrieval-transfer both from a spatial and a temporal point of view, with the development of cryobanks of oocytes permitting crossborder donation. However, while some studies report comparable success when using vitrified and fresh oocytes we still need to investigate whether the use of fresh oocytes give higher live birth rate than cryopreserved ones, when the same number of oocytes are given. The performance of embryo cryopreservation, conversely, seems to be more reliable. A novel approach based on the shipment of frozen sperm from the recipient’s country to the oocyte donor’s one, where fresh oocytes are inseminated and the resulting embryos frozen and transported back to the referring IVF centre to perform a frozen embryo transfer may be a good strategy. We believe that the use of frozen embryos from fresh oocytes could be associated with a higher cumulative live birth rate per cycle, while favouring personalised oocyte recipient care with a flexible number of oocytes assigned and limiting the burden of travelling abroad.","La Marca, A; Capuzzo, M; Bartolucci, S; Schirinzi, F; Dal Canto, MB; Buratini, J; Mignini Renzini, M; Rodriguez, A; Vassena, R",,536,19

It may occur after cataract surgery and may give rise to poor visual outcome, with reduced visual acuity and distortion of the central vision. MO is often self-limiting with spontaneous resolution, but a small proportion of people with chronic persistent MO may be difficult to treat. Chronic oedema may lead to the formation of cystic spaces in the retina termed 'cystoid macular oedema' (CMO). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in cataract surgery and may reduce the chances of developing MO. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review is to answer the question: is there evidence to support the prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs either in addition to, or instead of, topical steroids postoperatively to reduce the incidence of macular oedema (MO) and associated visual morbidity. SEARCH METHODS We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. Date last searched 2 September 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which adult participants had undergone surgery for age-related cataract. We included participants irrespective of their baseline risk of MO, in particular we included people with diabetes and uveitis. We included trials of preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs in conjunction with postoperative topical steroids. The comparator was postoperative topical steroids alone. A secondary comparison was preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs alone versus postoperative topical steroids alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using standard methods expected by Cochrane. We pooled data using a random-effects model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and considered the following: risk of bias of included studies, precision of the effect estimate, consistency of effects between studies, directness of the outcome measure and publication bias. MAIN RESULTS We identified 34 studies that were conducted in the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and South-East Asia. Over 5000 people were randomised in these trials. The majority of studies enrolled one eye per participant; a small subset (4 trials) enrolled a proportion of people with bilateral surgery. Twenty-eight studies compared NSAIDs plus steroids with steroids alone. Six studies compared NSAIDs with steroids. A variety of NSAIDs were used, including ketorolac, diclofenac, nepafenac, indomethacin, bromfenac, flurbiprofen and pranopfen. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. In general, the studies were poorly reported. We did not judge any of the studies at low risk of bias in all domains. Six studies were funded by industry, seven studies were funded from non-industry sources, and the rest of the studies did not report the source of funding.There was low-certainty evidence that people receiving topical NSAIDs in combination with steroids may have a lower risk of poor vision due to MO at three months after cataract surgery compared with people receiving steroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.76; eyes = 1360; studies = 5; I2 = 5%). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias in the included studies and indirectness, as the extent of visual loss was not always clear. Only one study reported poor vision due to MO at 12 months and we judged this to be very low-certainty evidence as there were only two events. Quality of life was only reported in one of the 34 studies comparing NSAIDs plus steroids versus steroids alone, and it was not fully reported, other than to comment on lack of differences between groups. There was evidence of a reduced risk of MO with NSAIDs at three months after surgery, but we judged this to be low-certainty due to risk of bias and publication bias (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.49; eyes = 3638; studies = 21). There was inconsistent evidence on central retinal thickness at three months (I2 = 87%). Results ranged from -30.9 µm in favour of NSAIDs plus steroids to 7.44 µm in favour of steroids alone. Similarly, data on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were inconsistent, but nine out of 10 trials reporting this outcome found between-group differences in visual acuity of less than 0.1 logMAR.None of the six studies comparing NSAIDs alone with steroids reported on poor vision due to MO at three or 12 months. There was low-certainty evidence that central retinal thickness was lower in the NSAIDs group at three months (mean difference (MD) -22.64 µm, 95% CI -38.86 to -6.43; eyes = 121; studies = 2). Five studies reported on MO and showed a reduced risk with NSAIDs, but we judged this evidence to be of low-certainty (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.41; eyes = 520). Three studies reported BCVA at three months and the results of these trials were inconsistent, but all three studies found differences of less than 0.1 logMAR between groups.We did not note any major adverse events - the main consistent observation was burning or stinging sensation with the use of NSAIDs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Using topical NSAIDs may reduce the risk of developing macular oedema after cataract surgery, although it is possible that current estimates as to the size of this reduction are exaggerated. It is unclear the extent to which this reduction has an impact on the visual function and quality of life of patients. There is little evidence to suggest any important effect on vision after surgery. The value of adding topical NSAIDs to steroids, or using them as an alternative to topical steroids, with a view to reducing the risk of poor visual outcome after cataract surgery is therefore uncertain. Future trials should address the remaining clinical uncertainty of whether prophylactic topical NSAIDs are of benefit, particularly with respect to longer-term follow-up (at least to 12 months), and should be large enough to detect reduction in the risk of the outcome of most interest to patients, which is chronic macular oedema leading to visual loss.","Lim, Blanche X; Lim, Chris Hl; Lim, Dawn K; Evans, Jennifer R; Bunce, Catey; Wormald, Richard",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,536,19

METHODS We performed a retrospective study enrolling all infants (less than 12 months old) admitted with the diagnosis of acute viral bronchiolitis and submitted to mechanical ventilation in an university affiliated Brazilian pediatric intensive care unit between March, 2004 and September, 2006 (3 consecutives winters). The mechanical ventilation parameters' employed on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th day and before extubation were evaluated as well as the evolution (mortality rate, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the prevalence of complications). The groups were compared using the Student t test, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Chi-square test. RESULTS Fifty-nine infants were included (3.8 ± 2.7 months old, 59% male), with 9.0 ± 9.4 days on mechanical ventilation. Prior mechanical ventilation, non invasive ventilation was instituted in 71% of children. Anemia was observed in 78% of the sample. In 51 infants (86.5%) the lower airway obstructive pattern was maintained up to tracheal extubation with a nil mortality and low prevalence of pneumothorax (7.8%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 8 infants (13.5%), with higher mortality and a higher prevalence of pneumothorax (62.5%). CONCLUSIONS The declining mortality in acute viral bronchiolitis is observed even in non developed regions, involving children with high rates of anemia and premature labor.

Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers, especially those in hospitals, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. This review draws upon qualitative and quantitative studies of the SARS outbreak in Toronto to outline the factors that contributed to healthcare workers' experiencing the outbreak as a psychological trauma. Overall, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital workers. Three categories of contributory factors were identified. Relevant contextual factors were being a nurse, having contact with SARS patients and having children. Contributing attitudinal factors and processes were experiencing job stress, perceiving stigmatization, coping by avoiding crowds and colleagues, and feeling scrutinized. Pre-existing trait factors also contributed to vulnerability. Lessons learned from the outbreak include: (i) that effort is required to mitigate the psychological impact of infection control procedures, especially the interpersonal isolation that these procedures promote; (ii) that effective risk communication is a priority early in an outbreak; (iii) that healthcare workers may have a role in influencing patterns of media coverage that increase or decrease morale; (iv) that healthcare workers benefit from resources that facilitate reflection on the effects of extraordinary stressors; and (v) that healthcare workers benefit from practical interventions that demonstrate tangible support from institutions.","Maunder, Robert","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

METHODS Sixty-seven HD patients (53 men and 14 women; mean age, 67.1 ± 1.2 years; mean HD duration, 5.6 ± 0.9 years) were recruited. In addition, 15 healthy individuals (nine men and six women; mean age, 38.2 ± 4.6 years) were recruited as the control group. Lower-limb muscle regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) was monitored on the lateral side of the gastrocnemius muscle before HD using an INVOS 5100C (Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan), which utilizes near-infrared spectroscopy. Here, we evaluated the association between lower-limb muscle rSO2 and clinical parameters. RESULTS The rSO2 values were significantly lower in patients undergoing HD than in healthy individuals (50.0% ± 1.7% vs 76.8% ± 2.5%, P < 0.001). Lower-limb muscle rSO2 showed significant positive correlations with diastolic blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen concentration, serum creatinine concentration, serum potassium concentration, serum inorganic phosphate concentration, and serum albumin concentration as well as negative correlation with HD duration. We conducted a multiple linear regression analysis using parameters that were significantly correlated with the lower-limb muscle rSO2 in a simple linear regression analysis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that lower-limb muscle rSO2 was independently associated with serum inorganic phosphate (standardized coefficient: 0.27) and serum albumin concentrations (standardized coefficient: 0.24). In addition, there were no differences in lower-limb muscle rSO2 between diabetic and non-diabetic HD patients. This study has several limitations. Firstly, its sample size was relatively small. Secondly, we could not evaluate the association between lower-limb muscle rSO2 and calculated nutritional markers, including normalized protein catabolic rate and body mass index, anthropometric measurements representing nutritional status, and the severity of protein-energy wasting. Finally, we did not routinely examine the arterial vascular status of HD patients without symptoms of peripheral artery disease. As such, it is possible that some HD patients with subclinical peripheral artery disease may have been included in this study. CONCLUSION In HD patients, the oxygenation of lower-limb muscle tissue was associated with serum inorganic phosphate and albumin concentrations, both of which represent nutritional status.","Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Ookawara, Susumu; Ito, Kiyonori; Yanai, Katsunori; Ishii, Hiroki; Kitano, Taisuke; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Ueda, Yuichiro; Kaku, Yoshio; Hirai, Keiji; Hoshino, Taro; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",World journal of nephrology,536,1

The SCoV 5'UTR was predicted to contain a fourth stem-loop, named SL3, in which the leader transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) is folded into a hairpin loop. cDNAs corresponding to MHV/SCoV chimeric genomes were constructed by replacing the complete MHV 5'UTR with the corresponding SCoV sequence and by separately replacing MHV 5'UTR putative SL1, putative SL2, TRS, and putative SL4 with the corresponding SCoV sequences. Chimeric genomes were transcribed in vitro, and viruses were recovered after electroporation into permissive cells. Genomes in which the MHV 5'UTR SL1, SL2, and SL4 were individually replaced by their SCoV counterparts were viable. Chimeras containing the complete SCoV 5'UTR or the predicted SCoV SL3 were not viable. A chimera containing the SCoV 5'UTR in which the SCoV TRS was replaced with the MHV TRS was also not viable. The chimera containing the entire SCoV 5'UTR failed to direct the synthesis of any virus-specific RNA. Replacing the SCoV TRS with the MHV TRS in the MHV/5'UTR SCoV chimera permitted the synthesis of minus-sense genome-sized RNA but did not support the production of positive- or minus-sense subgenomic RNA7. A similar phenotype was obtained with the MHV/SCoV SL3 chimera. These results suggest a role for the TRS in the replication of minus-sense genomic RNA in addition to its known function in subgenomic RNA synthesis.","Kang, Hyojeung; Feng, Min; Schroeder, Megan E; Giedroc, David P; Leibowitz, Julian L",Journal of virology,536,33

This study was carried out with sows vaccinated with TGEV or the antigenically related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). TGEV vaccination of sows resulted in greater lactogenic protection of suckling piglets against TGEV challenge and a higher secretory immune response than PRCV vaccination did. These differences in the immune response were conditioned by the route of antigen presentation as a result of the different tropism of each virus. Epitopes on S protein, and in particular those contained in its antigenic site. A, were more immunogenic than epitopes on N and M proteins in both groups of vaccinated sows, as determined by a competitive radioimmunoassay. Minor differences in antibody response against the previously defined antigenic subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac were also detected, with subsite Ab being the most antigenic in both TGEV- and PRCV-immune sows. These findings suggest that antigenic site A on S protein, involved in virus neutralization, is the immunodominant site in pregnant sows that confer lactogenic protection. They also validate, in experiments with secretory antibodies, the antigenic maps made with murine monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, this antigenic site should be considered for vaccine or diagnostic development.","De Diego, M; Laviada, M D; Enjuanes, L; Escribano, J M",Journal of virology,536,19

BHV-1 infection was established. Cotton rat lung cells were similar to bovine cells in their ability to support BHV-1 replication in vitro. Furthermore, i.n. inoculation of cotton rats with BHV-1 resulted in pulmonary lesions comparable to BHV-1 infection in cattle. Using this model, the potential of i.n. and gastrointestinal (g.i.) immunization was examined with recombinant human adenoviruses expressing glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 to induce protective immunity against BHV-1. The replication-competent virus (gD-dE3) was more efficient than the replication-defective virus (gD-dE1E3) in inducing gD-specific antibody in the serum and in the respiratory tract. Furthermore, i.n. immunization with gD-dE3 stimulated antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells in the lung 12 weeks following immunization. Protection against BHV-1 challenge correlated with gD-specific antibody levels such that i.n. immunization with gD-dE3 conferred complete protection, while g.i. immunization conferred only partial protection of the lungs of most animals against BHV-1 challenge. In comparison, immunization with gD-dE1E3 by either route resulted in only a partial reduction of BHV-1 titre in the respiratory tract. The results obtained demonstrate that mucosal immunization with replication-competent recombinant adenovirus expressing gD of BHV-1 can induce immunity and protection against BHV-1 challenge.","Papp, Z; Middleton, D M; Mittal, S K; Babiuk, L A; Baca-Estrada, M E",The Journal of general virology,536,9

We have previously shown that mutants of A59, unable to induce hepatitis, may be selected by persistent infection of primary glial cells in vitro. These in vitro isolated mutants encoded two amino acids substitutions in the spike (S) gene: Q159L lies in the putative receptor binding domain of S, and H716D, within the cleavage signal of S. Here, we show that hepatotropic revertant variants may be selected from these in vitro isolated mutants (Q159L-H716D) by multiple passages in the mouse liver. One of these mutants, hr2, was chosen for more in-depth study based on a more hepatovirulent phenotype. The S gene of hr2 (Q159L-R654H-H716D-E1035D) differed from the in vitro isolates (Q159L-H716D) in only 2 amino acids (R654H and E1035D). Using targeted RNA recombination, we have constructed isogenic recombinant MHV-A59 viruses differing only in these specific amino acids in S (Q159L-R654H-H716D-E1035D). We demonstrate that specific amino acid substitutions within the spike gene of the hr2 isolate determine the ability of the virus to cause lethal hepatitis and replicate to significantly higher titers in the liver compared to wild-type A59. Our results provide compelling evidence of the ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve in vivo to highly virulent phenotypes by functional compensation of a detrimental amino acid substitution in the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.","Navas-Martin, Sonia; Hingley, Susan T; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,536,1

Toward defining the functional interactions between the EIAV SU protein (gp90) and its ELR1 receptor, we mapped the gp90 binding domain of ELR1 by a combination of binding and functional assays using the EIAV SU gp90 protein and various chimeric receptor proteins derived from exchanges between the functional ELR1 and the nonbinding homolog, mouse herpesvirus entry mediator (murine HveA). Complementary exchanges of the respective cysteine-rich domains (CRD) between the ELR1 and murine HveA proteins revealed CRD1 as the predominant determinant of functional gp90 binding to ELR1 and also to a chimeric murine HveA protein expressed on the surface of transfected Cf2Th cells. Mutations of individual amino acids in the CRD1 segment of ELR1 and murine HveA indicated the Leu70 in CRD1 as essential for functional binding of EIAV gp90 and for virus infection of transduced Cf2Th cells. The specificity of the EIAV SU binding domain identified for the ELR1 receptor is fundamentally identical to that reported previously for functional binding of feline immunodeficiency virus SU to its coreceptor CD134, another TNFR protein. These results indicate unexpected common features of the specific mechanisms by which diverse lentiviruses can employ TNFR proteins as functional receptors.","Zhang, Baoshan; Sun, Chengqun; Jin, Sha; Cascio, Michael; Montelaro, Ronald C",Journal of virology,536,16

METHODS Children <18 years of age, from a single-site outbreak, who satisfied a clinical case definition for SARS, with subsequent serologic confirmation, were treated according to a standard protocol and prospectively monitored. RESULTS Forty-four children were included. The median age was 12 years. Forty-two children (95.5%) demonstrated an epidemiologic link. Fever, cough, malaise, coryza, sputum production, headache, myalgia, lymphopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were common presenting features. Radiographic findings were nonspecific, but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic aid. A specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV yielded positive results for <50% of children. Of 9 children who developed hypoxemia, 8 were treated with methylprednisolone. Of 5 children who received intensive care, 3 required assisted ventilation. All children recovered, and serious adverse events in response to treatment were not observed. The outcomes at 3 to 6 months after disease onset, including exercise tolerance, pulmonary functions, and psychologic status, were favorable. An age of >12 years was associated with methylprednisolone therapy for severe illness. After exclusion of the only infant, an age of >12 years was associated with oxygen requirements. Sore throat, high neutrophil count at presentation, and peak neutrophilia were independent factors predicting severe illness. The clinical case definition demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (97.8%, 92.7%, 88%, and 98.7%, respectively) for diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Children are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Teenagers resemble adults with respect to disease progression and may develop severe illness.

One Health is a sustainable and rational option when the cumulative effects of health hazards on food and economic security are considered, but demands long-term financial investment. Projections of growth in the demand for livestock production and consumption in Asia and Africa also call for effective One Health responses. However, an effective response also requires validated evidence of the socio-economic value that the One Health approach can provide. Implementing the One Health approach depends on forging strong links between human and animal health services, the environment and public policy. The authors present a list of some of the national and transnational partnerships established since 2006. Political support, good governance and effective policies and networks are crucial building blocks for One Health sustainability. The Global Response to Avian Influenza was initially established under the joint leadership of the European Union, the United States and the United Nations System Influenza Coordination Office. Since then it has supported numerous initiatives, including the World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Global Early Warning System (GLEWS). Indeed, the Global Response to Avian Influenza paved the way for an unprecedented WHO/FAO/OIE tripartite partnership, which promoted the integration of foodborne, neglected zoonotic and tropical diseases within the One Health movement and led to the tripartite High-Level Technical Meeting of 2011 in Mexico. The One Health Global Network, which began as a proposition at an Expert Consultation in Winnipeg, Canada, in 2009, is now a reality. While its Global Guidance Group takes shape, the choice of soft-governance--an approach which relies more on information and advisory guidelines than on hierarchy and legislation, and which aims to steer local organisations rather than to control them--remains challenging. Nonetheless, the emergence of One Health as a professional and academic discipline, together with the growing references to a One Health culture, also offers new opportunities.","Vandersmissen, A; Welburn, S C",Revue scientifique et technique,536,1

All except one procedures were performed through our standard 2 cm umbilical vertical or smile incision. In 18 cases, abdominal irrigation/aspiration was easily performed through the existing larger incision, as is done with open surgical technique. None of the patients had early postoperative shoulder/back pain since complete disinflation of CO2could be ensured. All of the patients/parents were satisfied with the cosmesis. CONCLUSION SIPES has the advantages of limiting the surgical scar to within the umbilicus and providing easy disinflation of CO2, allowing intraabdominal cleaning and extraction of large volume tissue samples through a single large umbilical incision.","Yilmaz, Engin; Afsarlar, Cagatay Evrim; Erturk, Ahmet; Karaman, Ibrahim; Karaman, Ayse; Cavusoglu, Yusuf Hakan",Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,536,1

We aimed to determine the response of our paediatric surgical fraternity to a disease that overwhelmingly affects adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown. Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia. The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training. Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0.05. RESULTS Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded. Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Age <30 years was significantly associated with anxiety. Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p<0.001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p<0.020). CONCLUSION Specific to our paediatric surgical community, this study highlights areas of concern, particularly among junior doctors. It is likely that recurrent cycles of the pandemic will occur soon. These issues must be addressed to preserve the mental and emotional well-being of all health care workers.","Mahat, N; Zubaidi, S A; Soe, H H K; Nah, S A",The Medical journal of Malaysia,536,1

Although single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) provides excellent cosmetic results, the procedure is technically challenging and expensive compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach. OBJECTIVES To describe a novel, hybrid technique combining SILS and conventional laparoscopy using minimal abdominal wall incisions. METHODS Fifty patients diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis were operated using two reusable 5 mm trocars inserted through a single 15 mm umbilical incision and a single 2-3 mm epigastric port. This technique was clubbed ""minimal incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy"" (MILC). RESULTS MILC was completed in 49 patients (98%). In five patients an additional 3 mm trocar was used and in 2 patients the epigastric trocar was switched to a 5 mmtrocar. The procedure was converted to CLC in one patient. Mean operative time was 29 minutes (range 18-60) and the average postoperative hospital stay was 22 hours (range 6-50). There were no postoperative complications and the cosmetic results were rated excellent by the patients. CONCLUSIONS MILC is an intuitive, easy-to-learn and reproducible technique and requires small changes from CLC. As such, MILC may be an attractive alternative, avoiding the cost and complexity drawbacks associated with SILS.","Sakran, Nasser; Goitein, David; Raziel, Asnat; Hershko, Dan; Szold, Amir",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,536,1

We and others previously demonstrated that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV was through blocking the interaction between the S glycoprotein and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study, we used in vivo electroporation DNA immunization and a pseudovirus-based assay to functionally evaluate immunogenicity and viral entry. We characterized the neutralization and viral entry determinants within the ACE2-binding domain of the S glycoprotein. The deletion of a positively charged region Sdelta(422-463) abolished the capacity of the S glycoprotein to induce NAbs in mice vaccinated by in vivo DNA electroporation. Moreover, the Sdelta(422-463) pseudovirus was unable to infect HEK293T-ACE2 cells. To determine the specific residues that contribute to related phenotypes, we replaced eight basic amino acids with alanine. We found that a single amino acid substitution (R441A) in the full-length S DNA vaccine failed to induce NAbs and abolished viral entry when pseudoviruses were generated. However, another substitution (R453A) abolished viral entry while retaining the capacity for inducing NAbs. The difference between R441A and R453A suggests that the determinants for immunogenicity and viral entry may not be identical. Our findings provide direct evidence that these basic residues are essential for immunogenicity of the major neutralizing domain and for viral entry. Our data have implications for the rational design of vaccine and antiviral agents as well as for understanding viral tropism.","Yi, Christopher E; Ba, Lei; Zhang, Linqi; Ho, David D; Chen, Zhiwei",Journal of virology,536,19

This review details the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the aerodynamics, and different modes of transmission (e.g. droplets, droplet nuclei, and aerosol particles). SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by an infected person during activities such as expiration, coughing, sneezing, and talking. During such activities and some medical procedures, aerosols and droplets contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 particles are formed. Depending on their sizes and the environmental conditions, such particles stay viable in the air for varying time periods and can cause infection in a susceptible host. Very few studies have been conducted to establish the mechanism or the aerodynamics of virus-loaded particles and droplets in causing infection.

Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing.","Lam, K F; Deshpande, J V; Lau, E H Y; Naik-Nimbalkar, U V; Yip, P S F; Xu, Ying",Biometrics,536,19

From MHV-A59/MHV-JHM mixed infection, variant viruses (MHV-H1 and MHV-H2) which replicated efficiently in BHK cells were isolated. Under identical treatment conditions, the parental MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM strains failed to produce infectious virus or transcribe detectable levels of viral RNA or protein. The MHV-H isolates were polytrophic, replicating efficiently in normally nonpermissive Syrian hamster smooth muscle (DDT-1), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human adenocarcinoma (HRT), primate kidney (Vero), and murine 17Cl-1 cell lines. Little if any virus replication was detected in feline kidney (CRFK) and porcine testicular (ST) cell lines. The variant virus, MHV-H2, transcribed seven mRNAs equivalent in relative abundance and size to those synthesized by the parental virus strains. MHV-H2 was an RNA recombinant virus containing a crossover site in the S glycoprotein gene. At the molecular level, episodic evolution and positive Darwinian natural selection were apparent within the MHV-H2 S and HE glycoprotein genes. These findings differ from the hypothesis that neutral changes are the predominant feature of molecular evolution and argue that changing ecologies actuate episodic evolution in the MHV spike glycoprotein genes that govern interspecies transfer and spread into alternative hosts.","Baric, R S; Yount, B; Hensley, L; Peel, S A; Chen, W",Journal of virology,536,19

Our group has performed needlescopic grasper assisted SILC (nSILC) to overcome these problems. In this study, we introduce our technique and evaluate the safety and feasibility of this technique compared with the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). METHODS The medical records of 485 patients who received nSILC and CLC were reviewed retrospectively. Surgical outcomes including operative time, hospital stay, postoperative pain and perioperative complication were compared between the 2 techniques. RESULTS Although wound complications were developed more frequently in nSILC group, there was no significant difference between groups in other surgical outcomes. In subgroup analysis, surgical outcomes of nSILC were similar with those of CLC not only in easy group but also in difficult group. CONCLUSION It seems that nSILC is safe and feasible not only in selected patients but also in difficult cases such as acute cholecystitis.","Kim, Tae-Seok; Kim, Kee-Hwan; An, Chang-Hyeok; Kim, Jeong-Soo",Annals of surgical treatment and research,536,17

They are creating their own and changing culture. Which is a cause for concern for adults, who do not understand it. Moreover, usage peaks at a pivotal time in life: adolescence. Therefore it seems important to understand these new habits, and the reasons why social networks are such an important part of the life of adolescents. Furthermore, we looked into the question if virtual relationships have an impact on real-life relationships, and vice versa. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This literature review examined studies published between 2008 and September 2019. Twenty-five articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases. RESULTS Above all, teenagers are motivated to use social networks because they can develop an identity based on an idealized profile. This profile must be at least as good as those of their peers, in order to obtain the latter's approval. This is notably the case in a context where changes to the family structure give a greater weight to the opinion of peers. Young people are driven to seek refuge on the Internet by a lack of family support, and parents who are less emotionally present. This effect could be limited by encouraging communication between teenagers and their parents. Finally, romantic relationships are impacted by the availability of pornography. Viewing pornography is increasingly seen as a normal stage of development and is linked to poorer attachment to peers and family. CONCLUSIONS The Internet seems to support a gradual detachment from family life and a move towards greater inclusion in the peer group. This is all the more evident in a context where family structures are changing.","Jassogne, Carole; Zdanowicz, Nicolas",Psychiatria Danubina,536,27

Most studies have focused on hospitalized children or children from closed populations. It is essential that the viral etiology of these clinical diseases be accurately defined in the development of antiviral drugs. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of all common respiratory viruses as upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens in the first year of life. STUDY DESIGN This community-based birth cohort study prospectively collected detailed information on all ARI contracted by 263 infants from birth until 1 year of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected for each ARI episode, and all common respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Episodes were classified as upper respiratory illnesses or lower respiratory illnesses (LRI), with or without wheeze. RESULTS The majority reported 2-5 episodes of ARI in the first year (range, 0-11 episodes; mean, 4.1). One-third were LRI, and 29% of these were associated with wheeze. Viruses were detected in 69% of ARI; most common were rhinoviruses (48.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10.9%). Compared with RSV, >10 times the number of upper respiratory illnesses and >3 times the number of both LRI and wheezing LRI were attributed to rhinoviruses. CONCLUSION Rhinoviruses are the major upper and lower respiratory pathogens in the first year of life. Although RSV is strongly associated with severe LRI requiring hospitalization, the role of rhinoviruses as the major lower respiratory pathogens in infants has not previously been recognized.","Kusel, Merci M H; de Klerk, Nicholas H; Holt, Patrick G; Kebadze, Tatiana; Johnston, Sebastian L; Sly, Peter D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,536,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study had ethics review board endorsement, and the need for informed consent was waived. Selected serial chest radiographs obtained from the time of presentation until discharge or death in 1373 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were scored. Scoring was based on the area and location of lung opacification on radiographs obtained at each of five milestones (presentation, beginning of ribavirin therapy, beginning of corticosteroid therapy, time of most severe radiographic appearance of disease, and before discharge or death). Extents of lung opacification at these five milestones were compared between patients who died and those who survived (by using a repeated-measures analysis of variance model), and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical parameters was analyzed (by using Cochran-Armitage trend testing, Kendall tau correlation coefficients, and descriptive graphic analysis). RESULTS The final cohort consisted of 1373 patients (1212 of whom [485 male and 727 female patients; mean age, 38.4 years] survived and 161 of whom [84 male and 77 female patients; mean age, 63.0 years] died). Among survivors, older patients had more extensive radiographic changes than younger ones. However, among patients who died, older patients had less extensive radiographic opacification at the worst stage of disease and just before death than did younger patients. Despite a higher mortality risk for male patients, both sexes in the same outcome group had similar radiographic findings. For both outcome groups, the rate of radiographic progression was similar for the first 11 days but diverged afterwards. The extent of opacification increased by approximately one zone every 4-5 days for the initial 11 days. Radiographic scores correlated with the ratio of PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase level, and neutrophil count at each milestone and in terms of changes between milestones (P < .01 for all correlation coefficients, except for radiographic score and neutrophil count between the first two milestones). CONCLUSION The initial extent of radiographic opacification may be useful for prognostic prediction. Radiographic progression correlates well with that of important clinical and laboratory parameters and may be used as an objective prognostic indicator early in SARS.","Antonio, Gregory E; Ooi, Clara G C; Wong, Ka Tak; Tsui, Eva L H; Wong, Joyce S W; Sy, Alan N L; Hui, Joyce Y H; Chan, Cho Yin; Huang, Henry Y H; Chan, Yip Fai; Wong, Tai Pang; Leong, Lilian L Y; Chan, Jane C K; Ahuja, Anil T",Radiology,536,1

METHODS 173 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving tocilizumab in Reggio Emilia province Hospitals between 11 March and 3 June 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Clinical improvement was defined as status improvement on a six-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. A composite outcome of intubation/death was also evaluated. CRP and IL-6 levels were determined before TCZ administration (T0) and after 3 (T3), and 7 (T7) days. RESULTS At multivariate analysis T0 and T3 CRP levels were negatively associated with clinical improvement (OR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.55 and OR 0.11, CI 0.0-0.46) (p=0.006 and p=0.003) and positively associated with intubation/death (OR 17.66, CI 2.47-126.14 and OR 5.34, CI: 1.49-19.12) (p=0.01 and p=0.004). No significant associations with IL-6 values were observed. General linear model analyses for repeated measures showed significantly different trends for CRP from day 3 to day 7 between patients who improved and those who did not, and between patients who were intubated or died and those who were not (p<0.0001 for both). ROC analysis identified a baseline CRP level of 15.8 mg/dl as the best cut-off to predict intubation/death (AUC = 0.711, sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS CRP serial measurements in the first week of TCZ therapy are useful in identifying patients developing poor outcomes.","Cassone, Giulia; Dolci, Giovanni; Besutti, Giulia; Muratore, Francesco; Bajocchi, Gianluigi; Mancuso, Pamela; Catanoso, Mariagrazia; Spaggiari, Lucia; Galli, Elena; Palermo, Adalgisa; Pipitone, Nicolò; Croci, Stefania; Massari, Marco; Facciolongo, Nicola; Menzella, Francesco; Negri, Emanuele Alberto; Zerbini, Alessandro; Belloni, Lucia; Cimino, Luca; Teopompi, Elisabetta; Sampaolesi, Fabio; Salsi, Pierpaolo; Costantini, Massimo; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo; Aldigeri, Raffaella; Salvarani, Carlo",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,536,1

This study evaluates the impact of the bioterrorist anthrax attacks (""Amerithrax"") on hospital inpatient discharges in the metropolitan statistical area of Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties in the fourth quarter of 2001. Three statistical methods-standardized incidence ratio (SIR), segmented regression, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-were used to determine whether Amerithrax influenced inpatient utilization. The SIR found a non-statistically significant 2 percent decrease in hospital discharges. Although the segmented regression test found a slight increase in the discharge rate during the fourth quarter, it was also not statistically significant; therefore, it could not be attributed to Amerithrax. Segmented regression diagnostics preparing for ARIMA indicated that the quarterly data time frame was not serially correlated and violated one of the assumptions for the use of the ARIMA method and therefore could not properly evaluate the impact on the time-series data. Lack of data granularity of the time frames hindered the successful evaluation of the impact by the three analytic methods. This study demonstrates that the granularity of the data points is as important as the number of data points in a time series. ITSA is important for the ability to evaluate the impact that any hazard may have on inpatient utilization. Knowledge of hospital utilization patterns during disasters offer healthcare and civic professionals valuable information to plan, respond, mitigate, and evaluate any outcomes stemming from biothreats.","Burke, Lauralyn K; Brown, C Perry; Johnson, Tammie M",Perspectives in health information management,536,26

Three viral proteins, the spike protein (S) for attachment of virus to host cells, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro) for digestion of viral polyproteins to functional proteins, and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) for RNA synthesis are the most critical proteins for virus infection and replication, rendering them the most important drug targets for both antibody and chemical drugs. Due to its low-fidelity polymerase, the virus is subject to frequent mutations. To date, the sequence data from tens of thousands of virus isolates have revealed hundreds of mutations. Although most mutations have a minimum consequence, a small number of non-synonymous mutations may alter the virulence and antigenicity of the mutants. To evaluate the effects of viral mutations on drug safety and efficacy, we reviewed the biochemical features of the three main proteins and their potentials as drug targets, and analyzed the mutation profiles and their impacts on RNA therapeutics. We believe that monitoring and predicting mutation-introduced protein conformational changes in the three key viral proteins and evaluating their binding affinities and enzymatic activities with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated drugs by using computational modeling and machine learning processes can provide valuable information for the consideration of drug efficacy and drug safety for drug developers and drug reviewers.

A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVSTs) may be a direct complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020. We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome. We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. RESULTS: There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers. Patients in our case series were mostly female (7/8, 87.5%). Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms such as headache (50%), fever (50%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (75%). Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits (2/8, 25%) or decreased consciousness (2/8, 25%). D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data. The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation (6/8, 75%). Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID-19 diagnosis was 3 days (interquartile range 0.75-3 days).

This brute-force strategy is not only time consuming, as simulations are slow when the population is large, but also inaccurate, since it is impossible to enumerate all parameter combinations. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose to transform the non-differentiable problem of finding optimal $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$ to a differentiable one, where we first train a recurrent net to fit a small number of simulation data. Next, based on this recurrent net that is able to generalize SEIR simulations, we are able to transform the objective to a differentiable one with respect to $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$, and straightforwardly obtain its optimal value. The proposed strategy is both time efficient as it only relies on a small number of SEIR simulations, and accurate as we are able to find the optimal $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$ based on the differentiable objective. On two COVID-19 datasets, we observe that the proposed strategy leads to significantly better parameter estimations with a smaller number of simulations.","Fan, Chun; Meng, Yuxian; Sun, Xiaofei; Wu, Fei; Zhang, Tianwei; Li, Jiwei",,536,21

We consider an autoregressive model with a non-linear time trend component that approximately converts into the linear trend using the spline function. The spline function splits the series of COVID-19 into different piecewise segments between respective knots in the form of various growth stages and fits the linear time trend. First, we obtain the number of knots with their locations in the COVID-19 series to identify the transmission stages of COVID-19 infection. Then, the estimation of the model parameters is obtained under the Bayesian setup for the best-fitted model. The results advocate that the proposed model appropriately determines the location of knots based on different transmission stages and know the current transmission situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country.","Kumar, J.; Agiwal, V.; Yau, C.

This study aims to identify the most significant risk factors for spreading COVID-19 to help policymakers take early measures for the next waves. Methods We conducted the study on randomly selected 29 countries where the pandemic had a downward trend in the daily active cases curve as of June 10, 2020. We investigated the association with the standardized spreading index and demographical, environmental, socioeconomic, and government intervention. To standardize the spreading index, we accounted for the number of tests and the timeline bias. Furthermore, we performed multiple linear regression to identify the relative importance of the variables. Results In the correlation analysis, air pollution, PM2.5 (r = 0.37, p = 0.0466), number of days to impose lockdown from first case (r = 0.38, p = 0.0424) and total confirmed cases on the first lockdown (r = 0.61, p = 0.0004) were associated with outcome measures.

Volatile compounds (VCs) have been suggested for several decades as fulfilling these criteria. However currently very little work has been done in trying to diagnose viral infections using VCs. Much of the work carried out to date involves the differentiation of bacterial and viral sources of infection and often the detection of bacterial and viral co-infection. However, this has usually been done in vitro and very little work has involved the use of human participants. Viruses hijack the host cell metabolism and do not produce their own metabolites so identifying virus specific VCs is at best a challenging task. However, there are proteins and lipids that are potential candidates as markers of viral infection. The current understanding is that host cell glycolysis is upregulated under viral infection to increase the available energy for viral replication. There is some evidence that viral infection leads to the increase of production of fatty acids, alkanes, and alkanes related products. For instance, 2,3-butandione, aldehydes, 2,8-dimethyl-undecane and n-propyl acetate have all been correlated with viral infection. Currently, the literature points to markers of oxidative stress (e.g. nitric oxide, aldehydes etc) being the most useful in the determination of viral infection. The issue, however, is that there are also many other conditions that can lead to oxidative stress markers being produced. In this review a range of (mainly mass spectrometric) methods are discussed for viral detection in breath, including breath condensate. Currently MALDI-ToF-MS is likely to be the preferred method for the identification of viral strains and variants of those strains, however it is limited by its need for the viral strains to have been sequenced and logged in a database.","Gould, Oliver; Ratcliffe, Norman; Król, Ewelina; de Lacy Costello, Ben",J Breath Res,536,9

This study examined whether head and thorax elevation post-ROSC is beneficial, in a porcine model. METHODS: Protocol A: 40 kg anesthetized pigs were positioned flat, after 7.75 minutes of untreated CA the heart and head were elevated 8 and 12 cm, respectively, above the horizontal plane, automated active compression decompression (ACD) plus impedance threshold device (ITD) CPR was started, and 2 minutes later the heart and head were elevated 10 and 22 cm, respectively, over 2 minutes to the highest head up position (HUP). After 30 minutes of CPR pigs were defibrillated and randomized 10 minutes later to four 5-minutes epochs of HUP or flat position. Multiple physiological parameters were measured. In Protocol B, after 6 minutes of untreated VF, pigs received 6 minutes of conventional CPR flat, and after ROSC were randomized HUP versus Flat as in Protocol A. The primary endpoint was cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP). Multivariate analysis-of-variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures was used. Data were reported as mean ± SD. RESULTS: In Protocol A, intracranial pressure (ICP) (mmHg) was significantly lower post-ROSC with HUP (9.1 ± 5.5) versus Flat (18.5 ± 5.1) (p < 0.001). Conversely, CerPP was higher with HUP (62.5 ± 19.9) versus Flat (53.2 ± 19.1) (p = 0.004), respectively. Protocol A and B results comparing HUP versus Flat were similar. CONCLUSION: Post-ROSC head and thorax elevation in a porcine model of cardiac arrest resulted in higher CerPP and lower ICP values, regardless of VF duration or CPR method.

METHODS: Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. 10 of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviours included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12).

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the lockdown secondary to the pandemic on patient numbers and pattern of injuries at the department of traumatology of the Medical University of Vienna. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study identified all patients admitted and enrolled onto the trauma registry at a level I trauma center, between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 (lockdown) and compared them to those between 15 March 2019 and 30 April 2019 (baseline). Variables collected included patient age, sex, reason for hospital admission, place of injury, death, injury severity score (ISS), as well as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. RESULTS: A total of 10,938 patient visits to the trauma emergency department were analyzed, 8353 presentations during the baseline period and 2585 during lockdown. Only 1869 acutely injured and 716 follow-up patients presented during lockdown, compared to 6178 and 2175, respectively, during baseline. Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown there were significant reductions in both workplace and traffic accidents, sports injuries, number of hospitalized patients, and overall visits to the trauma emergency department; however, the number of major traumas and hip fractures remained similar. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the frequency of injuries at home as well as hospital admissions due to attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction in total number of patients, trauma departments should continue to provide adequate service during lockdown considering that severe injuries showed no change. Conditions such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to mental health care and support might account for the significant rise in hospital admissions due to suicides. We recommend that more attention and effort should be made to prevent this excess of suicide deaths.","Nia, Arastoo; Popp, Domenik; Diendorfer, Cornelia; Apprich, Sebastian; Munteanu, Alexandru; Hajdu, Stefan; Widhalm, Harald K",Wien Klin Wochenschr,536,29

However, many uncertain factors in the market make this issue a huge challenge. Especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the shortage of certain types of medical consumables has become a global problem. The intermittent demand forecast of medical consumables with a short life cycle brings some new challenges, such as the demand occurring randomly in many time periods with zero demand. In this research, a seasonal adjustment method is introduced to deal with seasonal influences, and a dynamic neural network model with optimized model selection procedure and an appropriate model selection criterion are introduced as the main forecasting models. In addition, in order to reduce the impact of zero demand, it adds some input nodes to the neural network by preprocessing the original input data. Lastly, a modified error measurement method is proposed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed forecasting framework is superior to other intermittent demand models.","Liu, Peipei",Health Informatics J,536,16

The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 μg/m3in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively.

The reductions in emissions of PM2.5precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable. More efforts should be made to completely avoid severe air pollution.","Wang, Pengfei; Chen, Kaiyu; Zhu, Shengqiang; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Hongliang",Resour. Conserv. Recycl.,536,1

OBJECTIVE: To determine the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of low-dose ketamine infusion for MS-related fatigue. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, active-placebo-controlled trial, 18 subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) and reported fatigue received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). The primary outcome was change in Daily Fatigue Severity (DFS) for 7 days following the infusion. Secondary outcomes included Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) measured up to day 28 post-infusion. We analyzed changes in all outcomes using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: In total, 18 participants were enrolled; 67% participants received ketamine. Side effects of ketamine were transient. No change in the DFS was observed after 7 days (-0.10 point; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.32, 0.12; p = 0.40). We observed a trend in reduced FSS scores at 1 week (-5.2 points; 95% CI: -10.4, 0.14; p = 0.06) and a clinically and statistically significant reduction in MFIS score at day 28 (-13.5 point; 95% CI: -25.0, -1.98; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine infusions were safe and well-tolerated. While no change in DFS after 7 days was observed, secondary analyses suggest a benefit of ketamine infusion for reduction of longer term fatigue severity in people with MS.","Fitzgerald, Kathryn C; Morris, Bridget; Soroosh, Aurash; Balshi, Alexandra; Maher, Dermot; Kaplin, Adam; Nourbakhsh, Bardia",Mult Scler,536,3

In those with end-stage heart failure, there is limited evidence that furosemide can be given subcutaneously to relieve symptoms and avoid hospital admission. METHOD: We initiated a community-based continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) furosemide service for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We aimed to increase patient choice, offer an alternative to hospital admission and, in patients at the end of their life, allow them to die at their preferred place of care with symptom alleviation. We retrospectively reviewed case notes. RESULTS: 36 consecutive episodes of CSCI of treatment were recorded in 28 patients. 15 patients (54%) survived beyond the initial treatment course with 13 patients (87%) avoiding acute hospital admission. There was a reduction in mean hospital admission rates from 2.87 to 0.73 (p<0.001) in the 6-month periods either side of the first episode of CSCI furosemide. A median reduction of 4 kg weight loss was recorded. 13 patients died during the initial treatment course. 12 (92%) died at home and 1 died at the hospital palliative care unit. All had symptoms controlled. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous furosemide can be successfully delivered in the community. In addition to palliation in the final days of life, community subcutaneous furosemide can be an effective treatment leading to weight loss and improved symptoms with survival for several months.","Brown, Andrew; Westley, Katharine; Robson, Judith; Armstrong, Leonie; Matthews, Iain; Runnett, Craig; Ripley, David; Thomas, Honey",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),536,3

Undocumented workers that might choose not to comply would risk the loss of employment (with no access to unemployment benefits due to their immigration status) and eviction from employer provided housing. Due to the nature of working and living conditions on farms, social distancing among farmworkers is nearly impossible and farmworkers were not provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) until infections were at an alarmingly high rate in NYS. Once infected, farmworkers were directed to contact County Health Departments that were frequently unfamiliar with the farmworker population and often lacked the necessary language or cultural competency skills to provide services to that community. Local community members expressed opinions that immigrant farmworkers were transmitters of the virus contributing to high levels of fear and mistrust in rural communities.

AIMS: This study aims to compare the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with cancer (with and without COVID-19) and characterize the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID-19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be Non-Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID-19 living in lower-income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All-cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID-19. Male sex, increasing age, living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000, history of pulmonary circulation disorders, and recent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy were associated with greater odds of all-cause mortality in multivariable logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: RWD can be rapidly leveraged to understand urgent healthcare challenges. Patients with cancer are more vulnerable to COVID-19 effects, especially in the setting of active cancer and comorbidities, with additional risk observed in NHB patients and those living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000.","Hwang, Clara; Izano, Monika A; Thompson, Michael A; Gadgeel, Shirish M; Weese, James L; Mikkelsen, Tom; Schrag, Andrew; Teka, Mahder; Walters, Sheetal; Wolf, Frank M; Hirsch, Jonathan; Rivera, Donna R; Kluetz, Paul G; Singh, Harpreet; Brown, Thomas D",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),536,10

It consists of surgical ablation of the posterior left atrium through a minimally invasive closed-chest approach followed by endocardial catheter ablation. The convergent procedure was developed to treat atrial fibrillation by creating a complete and comprehensive pattern of linear lesions on the left atrial backwall under direct endoscopic visualization while avoiding chest incisions and deflation of the lungs.

We show that several popular and widely used optimization criteria in the literature belong to this class of controllability metrics. Our main result is to provide a polynomial-time actuator schedule that on average selects only a constant number of actuators at each time step, independent of the dimension, to furnish a guaranteed approximation of the controllability/observability metrics in comparison to when all actuators/sensors are in use.

ASC protein is an adaptor protein present in several inflammasome complexes that performs several intra and extracellular functions, in monomeric form or as ASC specks, during physiological and pathological processes related to inflammation and adaptive immunity. Extracellular ASC specks (eASC specks) released during cell death by pyroptosis, can contribute as a danger signal to the propagation of inflammation via phagocytosis and activation of surrounding cells. ASC specks are found in the circulation of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and have been considered as relevant blood biomarkers of inflammation. eASC amplifies the inflammatory signal, may induce the production of autoantibodies, transports molecules that bind to this complex, contributing to the generation of antibodies and can induce the maturation of cytokines promoting the modeling of the adaptive immunity. Although several advances have been registered in the last 21 years, there are numerous unknown or enigmatic gaps in the understanding of the role of eASC specks in the organism.

Although statewide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders on social distancing behaviors. METHOD: This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020, to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS: From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home, and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home, and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing but accounted for only part of this behavioral change. Research on behavior change would be useful to determine additional interventions that could support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bourassa, Kyle J",Psychosom Med,536,3

People who have an underlying disease or taking immunosuppressive drugs are generally more likely to be infected than the others. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients may also be at risk of the disease and its complications depending on the medication they are taking. In this study, we evaluated a large population of patients with MS with different disease modifying drugs to show if any of them increases the risk. In addition, this study evaluates the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with MS, the rate of hospitalization or death in these patients. METHOD: This study was performed at the MS Clinic of Sina Hospital. All patients were contacted and their demographic characteristics were recorded. They were then asked about their COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with these symptoms were further evaluated. The documents were reviewed by treating neurologist and MS nurses to be sure about diagnosis of COVID19. The positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result or compatible lung computed tomography (CT) scan was acceptable for COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 4647 patients answered the phone contact. Of these, 68 were infected with the COVID-19. The rate of hospitalization was 25% which is far more than general population. Two patients died from COVID-19. Rituximab was associated with increase rate of COVID-19 infection but not with hospitalization rate. There was no significant correlation between use of other drugs and rate of infection. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 in MS patients is not more than general population, but the risk of hospitalization in these patients is higher than estimated for the disease. This highlights the importance of communicating to patients the severity of COVID-19 and the importance of risk reduction behaviors like social distancing and mask use.","Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Azimi, Amirreza; Navardi, Samira; Ala, Sara; Naser Moghadasi, Abdorreza",Mult Scler Relat Disord,536,6

Despite that, the detailed mechanisms behind the ageing process and its impact on various tissues and organs remain obscure. In general, changes in DNA, RNA and protein structure throughout life impair their function. Haematopoietic ageing refers to the age-related changes affecting a haematopoietic system. Aged blood cells display different functional aberrations depending on their cell type, which might lead to the development of haematologic disorders, including leukaemias, anaemia or declining immunity. In contrast to traditional bulk assays, which are not suitable to dissect cell-to-cell variation, single-cell-level analysis provides unprecedented insight into the dynamics of age-associated changes in blood. In this Review, we summarise recent studies that dissect haematopoietic ageing at the single-cell level. We discuss what cellular changes occur during haematopoietic ageing at the genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolomic level, and provide an overview of the benefits of investigating those changes with single-cell precision. We conclude by considering the potential clinical applications of single-cell techniques in geriatric haematology, focusing on the impact on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the elderly and infection studies, including recent COVID-19 research.","Strzelecka, Paulina M; Damm, Frederik",Dis. model. mech.

Such dramatic societal changes might cause overall sleep health to decrease (stress view), to remain unchanged (resilience view), or even to improve (reduced work/schedule burden view). METHODS: We addressed this question using longitudinal, cross-sectional, and retrospective recall methodologies in 699 American adult participants in late March 2020, two weeks following the enactment of social distancing and shelter-in-place policies in the United States. RESULTS: Relative to baseline data from mid February 2020, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses demonstrated that average sleep quality was unchanged, or even improved, early in the pandemic. However, there were clear individual differences: approximately 25% of participants reported that their sleep quality had worsened, which was explained by stress vulnerability, caregiving, adverse life impact, shift work, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms.

Following the Camelyon-16 challenge in 2016, several researchers have dedicated their time to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help radiologists and other clinicians diagnose breast cancer. In particular, there has been an emphasis on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS); the clinical term for early-stage breast cancer. Large companies have given their fair share of research into this subject, among these Google Deepmind who developed a model in 2020 that has proven to be better than radiologists themselves to diagnose breast cancer correctly. We found that among the issues which exist, there is a need for an explanatory system that goes through the hidden layers of a CNN to highlight those pixels that contributed to the classification of a mammogram. We then chose an open-source, reasonably successful project developed by Prof. Shen, using the CBIS-DDSM image database to run our experiments on. It was later improved using the Resnet-50 and VGG-16 patch-classifiers, analytically comparing the outcome of both. The results showed that the Resnet-50 one converged earlier in the experiments. Following the research by Montavon and Binder, we used the DeepTaylor Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) model to highlight those pixels and regions within a mammogram which contribute most to its classification. This is represented as a map of those pixels in the original image, which contribute to the diagnosis and the extent to which they contribute to the final classification.

A special challenge is to understand the relationship between death from and death with COVID-19, and therefore the relevance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in people with pre-existing burdens, for example coronary heart disease, cancer or older age. There is a need to extend the recently used tools to all available instruments, including physiological principles of prevention and promotion. The way to integrate global solidarity into the strategies of the different countries is critical not only for global health but also for the peace and long-term success for each individual country. The consequences of efforts against COVID-19 and the impact on reduced air pollution and climate change are also important to analyse from a global health perspective.","Kofler, Walter; Glazachev, Oleg S; Lyshol, Heidi; Tellnes, Gunnar",Scand J Public Health,536,17

Here we tested a symbol-trained chimpanzee's recall memory of a hidden food item's identity after a 10-min delay. During this delay, the subject was sometimes (depending on the condition) shown consistent or inconsistent video information about the identity of the food, before being asked to name the item to a second experimenter blind to the reward and condition. Across all conditions, our subject, Sherman, correctly named the food item at above chance levels. In the Inconsistent condition, in which Sherman was shown a video with misleading information, his performance was the worst of all conditions (although accuracy was still high). Interestingly, however, during three of the four trials in this condition in which Sherman made a mistake, he incorrectly named the food item shown during the misleading video information. These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems.","James, Brielle T; Webster, Mackenzie F; Menzel, Charles R; Whitham, Will; Beran, Michael J",Anim. cogn,536,16

A prior meta-analysis suggested the association of thrombocytopenia (TCP) with more severe COVID-19 illness and high mortality. Considering newly published studies, we updated the previous meta-analysis to confirm and explain the association of TCP with COVID-19 severity and multiple outcomes. Twenty-four studies with 5637 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The weighted incidence of TCP in COVID-19 was 12.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9%-17.7%). Data synthesis showed that the platelet number was lower in patients with either more severe illness or poor outcomes and even lower in nonsurvivors, with weighted mean differences of -24.56â ×â 109/L, -22.48â ×â 109/L, and -49.02â ×â 109/L, respectively.

Subgroup analysis by endpoint events suggested TCP to be significantly associated with mortality (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.08-26.14). Overall, the present comprehensive meta-analysis indicated that approximately 12% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have TCP, which also represents a sign of more severe illness and poor outcomes.","Zong, Xiaolong; Gu, Yajun; Yu, Hongjian; Li, Zhenyu; Wang, Yuliang",,536,29

One aspect of organizational behavior that can impact ethical culture and moral well-being is institutional betrayal. RESEARCH AIM: The purpose of this concept analysis is to develop a conceptual understanding of institutional betrayal in nursing by defining the concept and differentiating it from other forms of betrayal. DESIGN: This analysis uses the method developed by Walker and Avant. RESEARCH CONTEXT: Studies were reviewed using health literature databases with no date restrictions. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Analysis was conducted using established guidelines for ethical research. FINDINGS: Although institutional betrayal is a concept applied in the literature, there was a paucity of studies exploring the concept within nursing. Examples of the concept in the literature include violation of trust between organization (i.e. employer) and nurse, such as provision of inadequate workplace protections, ineffective or hostile management, and gaslighting of those who experience negative events. Examples of institutional betrayal have become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A conceptual definition of institutional betrayal is a deep violation of trust or confidence or violation of moral standards committed by an institution toward a nurse. This definition incorporates experiences and issues suggested by the literature. Outcomes are likely negative, including impacts on nurse psychological and workplace well-being. This concept likely fits within a framework of ethical workplaces and has conceptual relationships with moral distress and moral resilience. Further studies can help qualitatively explore and empirically measure this concept. CONCLUSION: In the pursuit of improving the ethical culture of healthcare workplaces, this concept can provide meaningful insight into organizational behavior and its consequences. Naming and describing the concept can promote conceptual clarity and equip researchers, nurses, and leaders to identify and mitigate the issue.","Brewer, Katherine C",Nurs Ethics,536,16

Our objective is to present the first report of Graves' disease onset immediately following recovery from mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a close temporal occurrence that should be studied further. Methods: We describe the clinical course and laboratory features, including thyroid function studies, antibody testing, and polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Results: A 21-year-old woman with prediabetes, obesity, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to the emergency department reporting 3 days of tachycardia, palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. Laboratory investigation revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 (0.30-5.00) mcIU/mL with a free thyroxine level of 3.8 (0.6-1.6) ng/dL, prompting endocrinology consultation. On physical examination, she had mild diffuse thyromegaly without tenderness and a history, which included hypothyroidism in her mother. Antibody testing results demonstrated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin and thyrotropin receptor antibody levels of 2.6 (<1.3) thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin index and 17 (0.00-1.75) IU/L, respectively. Sixteen days before presenting to the ED, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction test after reporting typical symptoms, including fever. Infectious symptoms resolved within 10 days. She achieved clinical and laboratory improvements with a combination of methimazole and beta blocker therapy. Conclusion: This case documents the occurrence of Graves' thyrotoxicosis following mild symptomatic COVID-19. Whether the preceding infection is coincidental or contributed to GD development requires definitive studies. This presentation may align with the theory of a viral link in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in those with genetic predisposition.","Harris, Asaf; Al Mushref, Mazen",,536,16

Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across sociodemographic groups is a crucial public policy challenge given that 1) vaccine supply will be constrained for the first several months of the vaccination campaign, 2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across groups, and 3) SARS-CoV-2 differs markedly from previous pandemic viruses. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited vaccine supply in the United States across groups differentiated by age and essential worker status, which constrains opportunities for social distancing. We model transmission dynamics using a compartmental model parameterized to capture current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate three alternative policy objectives (minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths) and model a dynamic strategy that evolves with the population epidemiological status. We find that this temporal flexibility contributes substantially to public health goals. Older essential workers are typically targeted first. However, depending on the objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to control spread or seniors to directly control mortality. When the objective is minimizing deaths, relative to an untargeted approach, prioritization averts deaths on a range between 20,000 (when nonpharmaceutical interventions are strong) and 300,000 (when these interventions are weak). We illustrate how optimal prioritization is sensitive to several factors, most notably, vaccine effectiveness and supply, rate of transmission, and the magnitude of initial infections.","Buckner, Jack H; Chowell, Gerardo; Springborn, Michael R",Proc.

The graft densities were estimated to be 0.04-0.28 chains nm. Under this graft dense region it is assumed that surface polymer chains form a polymer brush structure in good solvents. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction suggested that the tacticity of the PS chains on the nanoparticle surface is mainly atactic. PS-grafted-TiO nanoparticles were stably dispersed in good solvents for PS chains due to the steric repulsion between the grafted chains derived from the osmotic pressure effect and their affinity for the solvents. When the PS-grafted-TiO particles were finely dispersed, the ultraviolet absorption due to TiO was strong and the difference in absorbance between the visible and ultraviolet regions was ten or more times greater than that for non-grafted TiO. By adding PS-grafted-TiO particles with PS matrix powder in CHCl, hybrid films were prepared by solvent casting. The PS-grafted-TiO-PS hybrid films showed high transmittance in the visible light region accompanied by ultraviolet absorption characteristic of TiO due to the fine dispersion of nanoparticles in the PS matrix. Furthermore, friction tests revealed that the wear resistance of PS thin films with PS-grafted-TiO was improved compared with PS film.","Matsuno, Ryosuke; Otsuka, Hideyuki; Takahara, Atsushi",Soft Matter,536,33

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.","Pan, Pan; Li, Yichao; Xiao, Yongjiu; Han, Bingchao; Su, Longxiang; Su, Mingliang; Li, Yansheng; Zhang, Siqi; Jiang, Dapeng; Chen, Xia; Zhou, Fuquan; Ma, Ling; Bao, Pengtao; Xie, Lixin",J Med Internet Res,536,2

This paper examines the impact of U.S governor's party allegiance (Republican vs Democrat) on ethnic wage gap. A descriptive analysis of the distribution of yearly earnings of Whites and Blacks reveals a divergence in their respective shapes over time suggesting that aggregate analysis may mask important heterogeneous effects. This motivates a granular estimation of the comparative causal effect of governors' party affiliation on labor market outcomes. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on marginal electoral victories and samples of quantiles groups by wage and hours worked. Overall, the distributional causal estimations show that the vast majority of subgroups of black workers earnings are not affected by democrat governors' policies, suggesting the possible existence of structural factors in the labor markets that contribute to create and keep a wage trap and/or hour worked trap for most of the subgroups of black workers. Democrat governors increase the number of hours worked of black workers at the highest quartiles of earnings. A bivariate quantiles groups analysis shows that democrats decrease the total hours worked for black workers who have the largest number of hours worked and earn the least. Black workers earning more and working fewer hours than half of the sample see their number of hours worked increase under a democrat governor.","Tchuente, Guy; Kakeu, Johnson; Francois, John Nana",,536,1

The epidemiology and clinical course of infected patients with life-threatening forms of ALD, including severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis (DAC), and specific risk factors for infection remain mostly unknown. APPROACH & RESULTS: In this observational study, we assessed all infectious episodes occurring within a 90-day period from diagnosis in all consecutive patients with biopsy-proven sAH (mDF&#8805;32, MELD&#8805;18) and DAC (MELD&#8805;18), without alcoholic hepatitis, in our tertiary hospital between 2003 and 2016. A total of 207 patients were included, 139 with sAH and 68 with DAC. One hundred seventeen(84%) patients with sAH and 41(60%) patients with DAC experienced at least one infection episode at 90 days(p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with the development of infection were the presence of sAH and baseline MELD score. Bacterial infections represented the most common infection in the two groups, and only MELD score was independently associated with the occurrence of bacterial infection. In both groups, pneumonia was the most prevalent bacterial infection and Gram-negative bacilli were the main pathogens. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) occurred in 20(14.5%) patients with sAH and 3(4.5%) with DAC patients(p<0.05). Multivariable regression showed that younger age, higher MELD, and corticosteroid therapy were independently associated with IFI. The 90-day cumulative incidence of death in infected patients with sAH and DAC were 46% and 41.5% respectively(p=0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sAH are more susceptible to develop infection than those with DAC. In life-threatening forms of ALD, infected patients share a similar mortality rate. Corticosteroid treatment, not sAH, seems to be the main risk factor triggering IFI.","Otero Sanchez, Lukas; Karakike, Eleni; Njimi, Hassane; Putignagno, Antonella; Degré, Delphine; Hites, Maya; Jacobs, Frédérique; Moreno, Christophe; Trepo, Eric; Gustot, Thierry",Hepatology (Baltim.),536,24

The aim of this paper is to increase the knowledge of the socio-spatial behavior of coronavirus and implementing a geospatial methodology and digital system called SITAR (Fast Action Territorial Information System, by its Spanish acronym). We analyze as a study case a region of Spain called Cantabria, geocoding a daily series of microdata coronavirus records provided by the health authorities (Government of Cantabria-Spain) with the permission of Medicines Ethics Committee from Cantabria (CEIm, June 2020). Geocoding allows us to provide a new point layer based on the microdata table that includes cases with a positive result in a COVID-19 test. Regarding general methodology, our research is based on Geographical Information Technologies using Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Technologies. This tool is a global reference for spatial COVID-19 research, probably due to the world-renowned COVID-19 dashboard implemented by the Johns Hopkins University team. In our analysis, we found that the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in urban locations presents a not random distribution with clustered patterns and density matters in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, large metropolitan areas or districts with a higher number of persons tightly linked together through economic, social, and commuting relationships are the most vulnerable to pandemic outbreaks, particularly in our case study. Furthermore, public health and geoprevention plans should avoid the idea of economic or territorial stigmatizations. We hold the idea that SITAR in particular and Geographic Information Technologies in general contribute to strategic spatial information and relevant results with a necessary multi-scalar perspective to control the pandemic.","Cos, Olga De; Castillo, Valentín; Cantarero, David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),536,16

Widespread public health measures and travel restrictions have dampened viral spread but outbreaks are expected as restrictions are raised. This study was carried out in order to devise an approach that may help to predict deaths based on upsurges (spikes or waves) of cases. METHODS: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to August 2020 was obtained from the Our World In Data website. For the purposes of more detailed analysis, in addition to total global data, three countries were chosen for sub analysis: Italy, Germany and the United States. RESULTS: Delay to death (days) were as follows: World: 20.6 (95% CI: 8.4-32.8); USA: 19.8 (95% CI: 9.3-30.4); Germany: 18.8 (95% CI: 6.1-31.6); Italy: 2.4 (95% CI -10.2-15.0). DISCUSSION: Countries may be able to contain viral resurgence by adhering to WHO advice for reopening from restrictions/lockdowns. However, outbreaks are almost inevitable and deaths are to be expected approximately 20 days after rises in cases. This paper may therefore aid healthcare systems and hospitals for surges in cases as positive COVID-19 swabs increase in any given locality. Italy was an exception in these results as the initial surge and swabs taken represented symptomatic/admitted cases and not community surveillance tracking and tracing.","Grech, Victor; Scherb, Hagen",Early Hum Dev,536,1

We analyzed biosecurity and disinfection standards at the dental office and dental health personnel to date, and their adaptation to the needs and way of working of each. As a result, according to the information collected the following procedure was identified: a telephone appointment must be made and a questionnaire should be given before dental care; at arrival to the appointment, the temperature of the patient should be taken and proper cleaning and disinfection of the waiting room should be maintained. Panoramic radiography and CBCT are the auxiliary methods of choice. Absolute isolation and atraumatic restorative therapy techniques are a good alternative to decrease fluid exposure. The removal of protective clothing and accessories must follow a specific order and washing hands before and after is essential. In conclusion, the efficient biosecurity for dentists and patients in all dental care processes before, during, and immediately after the appointment reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection and allows healthy dental care environments.","Cabrera-Tasayco, Fiorella Del Pilar; Rivera-Carhuavilca, Juana Mercedes; Atoche-Socola, Katherine Joselyn; Peña-Soto, Claudio; Arriola-Guillén, Luis Ernesto",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,536,20

METHODS: Information was obtained from the Disease Analyzer database, which collects anonymous demographic and medical data from practice computer systems of general practitioners (GP) and neurologists (NL) throughout Germany. We retrospectively compared prescription data for anti-seizure medication (ASM) and physicians' notes of ""known"" and ""new"" PWE from January 2020 until May 2020 with the corresponding months in the three preceding years 2017-2019. Adherence was estimated by calculating the proportion of patients with follow-up prescriptions within 90â¯days after initial prescriptions in January or February. We additionally analyzed hospital referrals of PWE. The significance level was set to 0.01 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 52,844 PWE were included. Anti-seizure medication prescriptions for known PWE increased in March 2020 (GPâ¯+â¯36%, NLâ¯+â¯29%; Pâ¯<â¯0.01). By contrast, a decrease in prescriptions to known and new PWE was observed in April and significantly in May 2020 ranging from -16% to -29% (Pâ¯<â¯0.01). The proportion of PWE receiving follow-up prescriptions was slightly higher in 2020 (73.5%) than in 2017-2019 (70.7%, Pâ¯=â¯0.001). General practitioners and NL referred fewer PWE to hospitals in March 2020 (GP: -30%, Pâ¯<â¯0.01; NL: -12%), April 2020 (GP: -29%, Pâ¯<â¯0.01; NL: -37%), and May 2020 (GP: -24%, Pâ¯<â¯0.01; NL: -16%). CONCLUSION: Adherence of known PWE to ASM treatment appeared to remain stable during lockdown in Germany.

We investigated the safety and feasibility of fluoroscopy-guided nasojejunal (NJ) feeding tube placement in the prone position. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent fluoroscopic placement of NJ feeding tubes at a single institution between March 2020 and December 2020. Primary end points were success rate and number of attempts. Chi-squared and Fischer exact tests were used to compare prone and supine groups. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included in the study: 53 patients received NJ feeding tubes while prone and 157 while supine. All but one patient in the prone group had ARDS secondary to COVID-19, whereas 47 (30.3%) had COVID-19 in the supine group. The rate of successful placement was 94.3% in the prone group and 100% in the supine group. Mean number of attempts was 1.1 (SD, ±0.4) in the prone and 1.0 (SD, ±0.1) in the supine group (P = .14). Prone patients had a longer median fluoroscopy time (69 s, interquartile range [IQR] = 92; vs 48 s, IQR = 43; P < .001) and received a higher radiation dose during the procedure (47 mGy, IQR = 50; vs 25 mGy, IQR = 33; P = .004). No procedural complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy-guided NJ feeding tube placement in prone patients is feasible and safe.

It is undeniable that digital learning also brings out boredom for students. This saturation decreases student motivation to learn, coupled with anxiety about the uncertain pandemic situation. Decreased motivation and increased anxiety are related to the mathematical identity possessed by students. As a result of this decline, the mathematical identity of the students is also not good. This research was conducted to improve student mathematical identity by using games as learning media. Data were collected from two fifth-grade elementary school students who have a low-category mathematical identity. This research is qualitative research using a case study approach. The results showed that the games used as learning media succeeded in improving students’ mathematical identities. Other findings indicate that the circumstances around students, such as a pandemic, reduce students’ mathematical identity. Therefore, it is hoped that teachers’ creativity in developing students’ mathematical identities is expected because the development of students’ mathematical identities strongly depends on the treatment of the environment around them, such as teachers, friends, and even the learning media they use.","Hima, L.

The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through 'Virtual Work Flow' (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

The mice with the history of stress early in life showed increased susceptibility to SDS in adulthood and demonstrated long-lasting genome-wide alterations in gene expression and splicing as well as in the H3K4me3 epigenetic landscape in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, the high-throughput techniques applied here allowed us to simultaneously detect, for the first time, genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional changes in the murine prefrontal cortex that are associated with both chronic SDS and increased susceptibility to this stressor.","Reshetnikov, V V; Kisaretova, P E; Ershov, N I; Merkulova, T I; Bondar, N P",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,536,8

Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of MSCs on important clinical outcomes, as described below. TRIAL DESIGN: REALIST COVID 19 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple blinded trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across the United Kingdom. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS as defined by the Berlin definition, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical diagnosis or PCR test will be eligible. Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: more than 72 hours from the onset of ARDS; age < 16 years; patient known to be pregnant; major trauma in previous 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer); WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; venous thromboembolism currently receiving anti-coagulation or within the past 3 months; patient receiving extracorporeal life support; severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh > 12); Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; prisoners; declined consent; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; previously enrolled in the REALIST trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Allogeneic donor CD362 enriched human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension of a fixed dose of 400 x106 cells in 40ml volume, to be diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for administration. Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls). The cellular product (REALIST ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary safety outcome is the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary efficacy outcome is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and 14; respiratory compliance, driving pressure and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14; extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and 90-day mortality. RANDOMISATION: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials, University of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio. BLINDING (MASKING): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sample size of 60 patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the control group. If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). TRIAL STATUS: REALIST Phase 1 completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned to commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2 trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC. Submissions were made to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and MHRA to amend the protocol to a COVID-19 specific patient population and the protocol amendment was accepted by the REC on 27th March 2020 and MHRA on 30th March 2020 respectively. Other protocol changes in this amendment included an increase in the time of onset of ARDS from 48 to 72 hours, inclusion of clinical outcomes as secondary outcomes, the provision of an option for telephone consent, an indicative sample size and provision to continue recruitment beyond this indicative sample size. The current protocol in use is version 4.0 23.03.2020 (Additional file 1).

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol. We therefore hypothesize that microtubules may direct the particle to a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating.","Hoornweg, Tabitha E; Bouma, Ellen M; van de Pol, Denise P I; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A; Smit, Jolanda M",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,536,1

Hence, modulating ACE2 might impact SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, shedding and COVID-19 severity. Here, we investigated if the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker valsartan alters the expression of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, including ACE2, in human adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in which 36 participants (BMI 31.0±0.8 kg/m2 ) with impaired glucose metabolism received either valsartan or placebo for 26 weeks. Before and after 26 weeks treatment, abdominal subcutaneous AT and skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained, and gene expression of RAS components was measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Valsartan treatment did not significantly impact the expression of RAS components, including ACE2, in AT and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Given the pivotal role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 spread and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, our data suggest that the putative beneficial effects of ARBs on the clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 may not be mediated through altered ACE2 expression in abdominal subcutaneous AT.","de Ligt, Marlies; Hesselink, Matthijs K C; Jorgensen, Johanna; Jocken, Johan W E; Blaak, Ellen E; Goossens, Gijs H",Obesity (Silver Spring),536,9

Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows correlations with the available official data on the number of infected individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19 outbreak started in both North (Lombardia and Veneto) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested on other epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other countries. We also present a policy model connected with our methodology, which helps policy-makers to take informed decisions.","Pluchino, A.; Biondo, A. E.; Giuffrida, N.; Inturri, G.; Latora, V.; Moli, R.

It is practically impossible to implement this task manually due to the high volume of the relevant literature. Text mining has been considered to be a powerful approach to address this challenge, especially the topic modeling, a well-known unsupervised method that aims to reveal latent topics from the literature. However, in spite of its potential utility, the results generated from this approach are often investigated manually. Hence, its application to the COVID-19 literature is not straightforward and expert knowledge is needed to make meaningful interpretations. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical framework for estimating topic interactions and effective visualization for topic interpretation. Here we assumed that topics constituting a paper can be positioned on an interaction map, which belongs to a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on this assumption, after summarizing topics with their topic-word distributions using the biterm topic model, we mapped these latent topics on networks to visualize relationships among the topics. Moreover, in the proposed approach, the change of relationships among topics can be traced using a trajectory plot generated with different levels of word richness. These results together provide deeply mined and intuitive representation of relationships among topics related to a specific research area. The application of this proposed framework to the PubMed literature shows that our approach facilitates understanding of the topics constituting the COVID-19 knowledge.","Jeon, Yeseul; Chung, Dongjun; Park, Jina; Jin, Ick Hoon",,536,16

We report the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Multi-sourced nationwide cohort study of adults (age &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with TE and deaths from TE in England (hospital and community) between 1st February 2018 and 31st July 2020. Relative risks, adjusted for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, co-morbidities and time trend comparing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were estimated using Poisson regression. FINDINGS: Of 272,423 patients admitted with TE to 195 hospitals, 86,577 (31.8%) were admitted after 2nd March 2020 (first COVID-19 death in the UK). The incidence of TE hospitalised increased during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1090 to 1590 per 100,000 (absolute risk change 45.9% [95% CI 45.1-46.6%], adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.41-1.44]) driven particularly by pulmonary embolism; 1.49, 95% CI 1.46-1.52. TE were more frequent among those with COVID-19; 1.9% vs. 1.6%, absolute risk change 21.7%, 95% CI 21.0-22.4%, ARR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18-1.22. There was an increase in the overall mortality from TE during the pandemic (617, 6.7% proportional increase compared with the historical baseline), with more TE deaths occurring in the community compared with the historical rate (44% vs. 33%). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the incidence of hospitalised TE. There were more deaths from TE in the community highlighting a number of mechanisms including the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection and potential impact of delays in seeking help. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on 16 November 2020 for articles that documented the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the search terms ""COVID-19"" OR ""Coronavirus*"" OR ""2019-nCOV"" OR ""SARS-CoV"" AND (""Thromboembolism"" OR ""Venous Thromboembolism"" OR ""thromboembol*"") with no language or time restrictions. The majority of data on TE in COVID-19 pertains to hospitalised patients from retrospective cohort studies. One study found that TE in hospitalised patients was associated with an increased mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.54-2.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies in 9249 hospitalised patients calculated an overall pooled incidence of TE of 17.8% (95% CI: 9.9-27.4%), rising to 22.9% (95% CI: 14.5-32.4%) in patients admitted to intensive care (ICU). The most contemporary data are from a cohort of 1114 patients (715 outpatient, 399 hospitalised, 170 admitted to ICU). With robust COVID-19-specific therapies and widespread thromboprophylaxis the prevalence of venous TE in ICU patients was reported as 7% (n = 12) when catheter-/device-related events were excluded, and among the outpatients there was no TE reported. No published studies have used nationwide data to investigate TE during the pandemic or the effect of the pandemic on outcomes of patients with TE but without Covid-19. Added value of this study This retrospective multi-sourced nationwide unlinked cohort study compares the overall incidence and mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increased incidence of TE despite only a small proportion having a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may highlight the lack of testing, particularly in the community during the initial phase of the pandemic, and the possibility of other factors contributing to TE risk, such as decreased daily activity mandated by home quarantine and alterations in medication concordance. Mortality from TE was higher in the community during the pandemic and this highlights that adverse societal effects of the pandemic, such as aversion to seeking medical assessment, may precipitate worse outcomes related to TE. Implications of all the available evidence Evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces a hypercoagulable state and thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalised patients to prevent excess mortality from TE. Whether to anticoagulate non-hospitalised ambulatory patients with COVID-19 will be answered by ongoing trials. Clinicians should consider the risks posed by decreased daily activity and fear of medical contact, and provide appropriate advice to patients.","Aktaa, Suleman; Wu, Jianhua; Nadarajah, Ramesh; Rashid, Muhammad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Mamas, Mamas A; Gale, Chris P",Thromb Res,536,26

Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident. Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools. Methods: A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: “COVID-19”, “nCov 19”, and “Sars Cov 2”. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: “death”, “died”, “comorbidity”, “cause of death”, “biopsy”, “autopsy”, or “pathological”. Results: A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data. Discussion: The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies. The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer. The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock. Only 7 papers reported histological investigations. Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them. The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection. Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients. As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary. Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.","Salerno, Monica; Sessa, Francesco; Piscopo, Amalia; Montana, Angelo; Torrisi, Marco; Patanè, Federico; Murabito, Paolo; Li Volti, Giovanni; Pomara, Cristoforo",J.

Moreover, a shortage of available CT dataset hinders deep learning techniques applying to tackling COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based approach known as PPM-Unet to segmenting COVID-19 lesions from CT images. Our method improves an Unet by adopting pyramid pooling modules instead of the conventional skip connection and then enhances the representation of the neural network by aiding the global attention mechanism. We first pre-train PPM-Unet on COVID-19 dataset of pseudo labels containing1600 samples producing a coarse model. Then we fine-tune the coarse PPM-Unet on the standard COVID-19 dataset consisting of 100 pairs of samples to achieve a fine PPM-Unet. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method can accurately segment COVID-19 infection regions from CT images, and achieve higher performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation models in this study. It offers a promising tool to lay a foundation for quantitatively detecting COVID-19 lesions.","Ma, Yinjin; Feng, Peng; He, Peng; Ren, Yong; Guo, Xiaodong; Yu, Xiaoliu; Wei, Biao",,536,32

METHODS: Observational study of outpatient MH/SUD visits January 1st-June 30th, 2018-2020 by: 1) visit diagnosis group, 2) provider type, 3) patient race/ethnicity, 4) insurance, and 5) visit method (telemedicine vs. in-person). RESULTS: Each year, January-June 52,907-73,184 patients were seen for a MH/SUD visit. While non-MH/SUD visits declined during the surge relative to 2020 pre-pandemic (-38.2%), MH/SUD visits increased (9.1%)-concentrated in primary care (35.3%) and non-Hispanic Whites (10.5%). During the surge, MH visit volume increased 11.7% while SUD decreased 12.7%. During partial reopening, while MH visits returned to 2020 pre-pandemic levels, SUD visits declined 31.1%; MH/SUD visits decreased by Hispanics (-33.0%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (-24.6%), and among Medicaid (-19.4%) and Medicare enrollees (-20.9%). Telemedicine accounted for ~5% of MH/SUD visits pre-pandemic and 83.3%-83.5% since the surge.

The limited data that exist regarding the utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in these critically ill patients show poor overall outcomes. This report describes our institutional practice regarding the application and management of ECMO support for patients with COVID-19 and reports promising early outcomes. METHODS: All critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for ECMO support from March 10, 2020, to April 24, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were evaluated for ECMO support based on a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of less than 150 mm Hg or pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide exceeding 60 mm Hg with no life-limiting comorbidities. Patients were cannulated at bedside and were managed with protective lung ventilation, early tracheostomy, bronchoscopies, and proning, as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Among 321 patients intubated for COVID-19, 77 patients (24%) were evaluated for ECMO support, and 27 patients (8.4%) were placed on ECMO. All patients were supported with venovenous ECMO. Current survival is 96.3%, with only 1 death to date in more than 350 days of total ECMO support. Thirteen patients (48.1%) remain on ECMO support, and 13 patients (48.1%) have been successfully decannulated. Seven patients (25.9%) have been discharged from the hospital. Six patients (22.2%) remain in the hospital, of which 4 are on room air. No health care workers who participated in ECMO cannulation developed symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19.

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1010), aged 18-94, running from April 10-20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g., hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g., partnered sexual activity, dating app use). RESULTS: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, aged 20-29, unmarried, and low-income. Very frequent in-person connections were generally associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained very frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes. While COVID-19 social restrictions remain necessary, it will be critical to expand mental health services to serve those most at-risk and identify effective ways of maintaining social and sexual connections from a distance.","Rosenberg, Molly; Luetke, Maya; Hensel, Devon; Kianersi, Sina; Fu, Tsung-Chieh; Herbenick, Debby",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,536,1

DESIGN: A 5×2 factorial, randomised, between-subjects experiment, comparing four wordings of information about the test result and a control arm of no additional information; for both positive and negative test results. SETTING: Online experiment using recruitment platform Respondi. PARTICIPANTS: UK participants (n=1744, after a pilot of n=1657) quota-sampled to be proportional to the UK national population on age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were given a hypothetical COVID-19 PCR test result for 'John' who was presented as having a 50% chance of having COVID-19 based on symptoms alone. Participants were randomised to receive either a positive or negative result for 'John', then randomised again to receive either no more information, or text information on the interpretation of COVID-19 test results copied in September 2020 from the public websites of the UK's National Health Service, the USA's Centers for Disease Control, New Zealand's Ministry of Health or a modified version of the UK's wording. Information identifying the source of the wording was removed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were asked 'What is your best guess as to the percent chance that John actually had COVID-19 at the time of his test, given his result?'; questions about their feelings of trustworthiness in the result, their perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence and what action they felt 'John' should take in the light of his result. RESULTS: Of those presented with a positive COVID-19 test result for 'John', the mean estimate of the probability that he had the virus was 73% (71.5%-74.5%); for those presented with a negative result, 38% (36.7%-40.0%). There was no main effect of information (wording) on these means. However, those participants given the official information from the UK website, which did not mention the possibility of false negatives or false positives, were more likely to give a categorical (100% or 0%) answer (UK: 68/343, 19.8% (15.9%-24.4%); control group: 42/356, 11.8% (8.8%-15.6%)); the reverse was true for those viewing the New Zealand (NZ) wording, which highlighted the uncertainties most explicitly (20/345: 5.8% (3.7%-8.8%)). Aggregated across test result (positive/negative), there was a main effect of wording (p<0.001) on beliefs about how 'John' should behave, with those seeing the NZ wording marginally more likely to agree that 'John' should continue to self-isolate than those viewing the control or the UK wording. The proportion of participants who felt that a symptomatic individual who tests negative definitely should not self-isolate was highest among those viewing the UK wording (31/178, 17.4% (12.5%-23.7%)), and lowest among those viewing the NZ wording (6/159, 3.8% (1.6%-8.2%)). Although the NZ wording was rated harder to understand, participants reacted to the uncertainties given in the text in the expected direction: there was a small main effect of wording on trust in the result (p=0.048), with people perceiving the test result as marginally less trustworthy after having read the NZ wording compared with the UK wording. Positive results were generally viewed as more trustworthy and as having higher quality of evidence than negative results (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public's default assessment of the face value of both the positive and negative test results (control group) indicate an awareness that test results are not perfectly accurate. Compared with other messaging tested, participants shown the UK's 2020 wording about the interpretation of the test results appeared to interpret the results as more definitive than is warranted.

In this work, we focus on an important nBSS instance, known as hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. HU is a matrix factorization problem aimed at factoring the so-called endmember matrix, holding the material hyperspectral signatures, and the abundance matrix, holding the material fractions at each image pixel. The hyperspectral signatures are usually highly correlated, leading to a fast decay of the singular values (and, hence, high condition number) of the endmember matrix, so HU often introduces an ill-conditioned nBSS scenario. We introduce a new theoretical framework to attack such tough scenarios via the John ellipsoid (JE) in functional analysis. The idea is to identify the maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the data convex hull, followed by affinely mapping such ellipsoid into a Euclidean ball. By applying the same affine mapping to the data mixtures, we prove that the endmember matrix associated with the mapped data has condition number 1, the lowest possible, and that these (preconditioned) endmembers form a regular simplex. Exploiting this regular structure, we design a novel nBSS criterion with a provable identifiability guarantee and devise an algorithm to realize the criterion. Moreover, for the first time, the optimization problem for computing JE is exactly solved for a large-scale instance; our solver employs a split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm with all proximal operators solved by closed-form solutions. The competitiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations and real data experiments.","Lin, Chia-Hsiang; Bioucas-Dias, Jose M",IEEE trans. neural netw. learn. syst.

Nevertheless, gastrointestinal infections have been reported, with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and lack of appetite. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 can remain positive in fecal samples after nasopharyngeal clearance. After gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral gastrointestinal infections, some patients may develop alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota. In addition, some COVID-19 patients may receive antibiotics, which may also disturb gastrointestinal homeostasis. In summary, the gastrointestinal system, gut microbiome, and gut-lung axis may represent an important role in the development, severity, and treatment of COVID-19.

It is vital to identify the novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets to assist with the subsequent diagnosis and treatment plan to mitigate the expansion of COVID-19. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-positive cells are hosts for COVID-19, we focussed on this cell type to explore the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19. In this study, we identified that ACE2-positive cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 belong to bronchial epithelial cells. Comparing with patients of COVID-19 showing severe symptoms, the antigen processing and presentation pathway was increased and 12 typical genes, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB1, CD74, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DMA, particularly HLA-DPB1, were obviously up-regulated in ACE2-positive bronchial epithelial cells of patients with mild disease. We further discovered SDCBP was positively correlated with above 12 genes particularly with HLA-DPB1 in ACE2-positive bronchial epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, SDCBP may increase the immune infiltration of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in different lung carcinoma. Moreover, we found the expression of SDCBP was positively correlated with the expression of antigen processing and presentation genes in post-mortem lung biopsies tissues, which is consistent with previous discoveries. These results suggest that SDCBP has good potential to be further developed as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target in the treatment of COVID-19.","Ma, Ding; Liu, Shuwen; Hu, Lili; He, Qinyu; Shi, Weiwei; Yan, Dongliang; Cao, Yin; Zhang, Guang; Wang, Zhongxia; Wu, Junhua; Jiang, Chunping",J Cell Mol Med,536,24

There were no marked changes in mean levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, or loneliness between 2019 and 2020, or over the course of the Spring 2020 term. Students in both the 2019 and 2020 cohort who indicated psychosocial vulnerability at the initial assessment showed worse psychosocial functioning throughout the entire Spring term relative to other students. However, rates of distress increased faster in 2020 than in 2019 for these individuals. Across individuals, homogeneity of variance tests and multi-level models revealed significant heterogeneity, suggesting the need to examine not just means but the variations in individuals’ experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews characterizes these varied experiences, describing the contexts for students’ challenges and strategies. This analysis highlights the interweaving of psychosocial and academic distress: Challenges such as isolation from peers, lack of interactivity with instructors, and difficulty adjusting to family needs had both an emotional and academic toll. Strategies for adjusting to this new context included initiating remote study and hangout sessions with peers, as well as self-learning. In these and other strategies, students used technologies in different ways and for different purposes than they had previously. Supporting qualitative insight about adaptive responses were quantitative findings that students who used more problem-focused forms of coping reported fewer mental health symptoms over the course of the pandemic, even though they perceived their stress as more severe. These findings underline the need for interventions oriented towards problem-focused coping and suggest opportunities for peer role modeling.","Morris, Margaret E.; Kuehn, Kevin S.; Brown, Jennifer; Nurius, Paula S.; Zhang, Han; Sefidgar, Yasaman S.; Xu, Xuhai; Riskin, Eve A.; Dey, Anind K.; Consolvo, Sunny; Mankoff, Jennifer C.",PLoS One,536,22

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","Tang, Zhou; Li, Xianbin; Li, Houqiang",,536,24

This virus designated as ACoV-00-1381 (ACoV) encodes all 10 open reading frames (ORFs) characteristic of Group 2 bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ACoV genome is clustered closely (>99.5% identity) with two BCoV strains, ENT and LUN, and was also closely related to other BCoV strains (Mebus, Quebec, DB2), a human corona virus (strain 043) (>96%), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (>93% identity). A total of 145 point mutations and one nucleotide deletion were found relative to the BCoV ENT. Most of the ORFs were highly conserved; however, the predicted spike protein (S) has 9 and 12 amino acid differences from BCoV LUN and ENT, respectively, and shows a higher relative number of changes than the other proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ACoV shares the same ancestor as BCoV ENT and LUN.","Jin, L.; Cebra, C. K.; Baker, R. J.; Mattson, D. E.; Cohen, S. A.; Alvarado, D. E.; Rohrmann, G.

Thus, by increasing the risk parameters in one region, the risk parameters in other regions decrease. Then, by adding space dimensions to the parameters in transmission risk models, and using the wave equations of manifolds for the regions, we obtain the dynamics of the exchanged novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) between countries.

This study investigated the impact of schistosomiasis on the transmission of COVID-19, and also evaluated the role of Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment coverage on COVID-19 outcomes in African countries. The schistosomiasis endemicity and the preventive chemotherapy (PCT) coverage index statuses were obtained from the WHO databank. The COVID-19 data was obtained from COVID-19 Worldometer’s report. The data were adjusted and the percentage COVID-19 confirmed, active cases, recovery, and deaths were computed. The COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated relative to schistosomiasis endemicity and treatment coverage. COVID-19 outcomes, especially, the active cases and recovery rates were significantly improved in schistosomiasis non-endemic African countries (p < 0.05). While COVID-19 confirmed cases were significantly higher in countries with > 75% schistosomiasis PCT coverage index (p <0.05), improved COVID-19 outcomes were observed relative to active cases and recovery in countries with > 75% PCT coverage index (p >0.05). This study showed that schistosomiasis endemicity could be associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes and higher PZQ treatment coverage could reduce COVID-19 active cases and improve the recovery rate.","Oyeyemi, Oyetunde T.; Okunlola, Oluyemi A.; Adebayo, Adebowale D.",New Microbes New Infect,536,16

Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and provided 24,782 weaned pups for use in 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (82%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs. paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam’s strain explained more than the sire’s strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam’s strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background, and that litter size is largely determined by dam’s strain rather than sire’s strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.","Shorter, John R.; Maurizio, Paul L.; Bell, Timothy A.; Shaw, Ginger D.; Miller, Darla R.; Gooch, Terry J.; Spence, Jason S.; McMillan, Leonard; Valdar, William; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando",G3 (Bethesda),536,23

We studied these parameters univariately, combined the significant ones in a multivariate model (AUROC 0.86, Nagelkerke PSEUDO-R2 0.5, Hosmer–Lemeshow p-value 0.9) and examined its discriminative performance in an internally-randomized validation cohort (AUROC 0.84). The cut-off selected according to Youden’s Index (−0.13) showed a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 72% in the training cohort, and a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 73% in the validation cohort. In addition, we determined the probability of having COVID-19 pneumonia for each Model for possible Early COvid-19 Recognition (MECOR) Score value. In conclusion, our model could provide a simple, rapid, and cheap tool for prompt COVID-19 diagnostic triage in patients with CAP. The actual effectiveness should be evaluated in further, prospective studies also involving COVID-19 patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs.","Sambataro, Gianluca; Giuffrè, Mauro; Sambataro, Domenico; Palermo, Andrea; Vignigni, Giovanna; Cesareo, Roberto; Crimi, Nunzio; Torrisi, Sebastiano Emanuele; Vancheri, Carlo; Malatino, Lorenzo; Colaci, Michele; Del Papa, Nicoletta; Pignataro, Francesca; Roman-Pognuz, Erik; Fabbiani, Massimiliano; Montagnani, Francesca; Cassol, Chiara; Cavagna, Lorenzo; Zuccaro, Valentina; Zerbato, Verena; Maurel, Cristina; Luzzati, Roberto; Di Bella, Stefano",Diagnostics (Basel),536,5

However, what is often overlooked is that emerging human diseases are usually preceded by the emergence of the same pathogen in an animal population. In fact, the developing disease in animals acts as a link allowing the disease to take hold and wreck havoc in public health.

Precision nutrition targeting metabolic pathways altered by ApoE4 provides a tool for the potential prevention of disease. However, no long-term human studies have been conducted to determine effective nutritional protocols for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease in ApoE4 carriers. This may be because relatively little is yet known about the precise mechanisms by which the genetic variant confers an increased risk of dementia. Fortunately, recent research is beginning to shine a spotlight on these mechanisms. These new data open up the opportunity for speculation as to how carriers might ameliorate risk through lifestyle and nutrition. Herein, we review recent discoveries about how ApoE4 differentially impacts microglia and inflammatory pathways, astrocytes and lipid metabolism, pericytes and blood–brain barrier integrity, and insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We use these data as a basis to speculate a precision nutrition approach for ApoE4 carriers, including a low-glycemic index diet with a ketogenic option, specific Mediterranean-style food choices, and a panel of seven nutritional supplements. Where possible, we integrate basic scientific mechanisms with human observational studies to create a more complete and convincing rationale for this precision nutrition approach. Until recent research discoveries can be translated into long-term human studies, a mechanism-informed practical clinical approach may be useful for clinicians and patients with ApoE4 to adopt a lifestyle and nutrition plan geared towards Alzheimer’s risk reduction.","Norwitz, Nicholas G.; Saif, Nabeel; Ariza, Ingrid Estrada; Isaacson, Richard S.",Nutrients,536,11

PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire. This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample. RESULTS: Correlational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress. Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved—including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine—predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger. CONCLUSIONS: By employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout. These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses’ symptoms of burnout. For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses’ psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.","Marjanovic, Zdravko; Greenglass, Esther R.; Coffey, Sue",Int J Nurs Stud,536,1

Methods: We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>=4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. Results: We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 census tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income <$50,000/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Francisco's shelter-in-place ordinance.","Chamie, G.; Marquez, C.; Crawford, E.; Peng, J.; Petersen, M.; Schwab, D.; Schwab, J.; Martinez, J.; Jones, D.; Black, D.; Gandhi, M.; Kerkhoff, A.

The aim of this review is to present the clinical profile of viral bronchiolitis, the different culprit viruses and the disease severity in relation to the viral etiology. DATA SOURCES: Databases including PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles about the clinical features of bronchiolitis and its viral etiology. The most relevant articles to the scope of this review were analyzed. RESULTS: Currently there are two main definitions for bronchiolitis which are not identical, the European definition and the American one. The most common viral pathogen that causes bronchiolitis is respiratory syncytial virus which was identified in 1955; now many other viruses have been implicated in the etiology of bronchiolitis such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus. Several studies have attempted to investigate the correlation of bronchiolitis severity with the type of detected virus or viruses. However, the results were not consitent. CONCLUSIONS: For the time being, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis remains clinical. The isolation of the responsible respiratory pathogens does not seem to confer to the prognosis of the disease severity.","Fretzayas, Andrew; Moustaki, Maria",World J Pediatr,536,21

A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of stringency and timing of the government responses to the early inflow of infected cases. Methods Regional data on mortality week 14-23 in 2020 compared with the same period 2015-2019 were retrieved from Eurostat and national statistical agencies. Data on initial government responses were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Variance-weighted least square regression was used with further adjustment for population density and age distribution. Results Being a region with winter holiday exclusively in week 9 was in the adjusted analysis associated with 16 weekly excess deaths (95% confidence interval 13 to 20) per million inhabitants, which corresponds to 38% of the excess mortality during the study period in these regions. A more stringent response implemented in week 11, corresponding to 10 additional units on the 0-100 ordinal scale, was associated with 20 fewer weekly deaths (95% confidence interval 18 to 22) per million inhabitants. Conclusions Travelling during winter holiday in week 9 was an amplifying event that contributed importantly to the excess mortality observed in the study area during the spring 2020. Timely government responses to the resulting early inflow of cases was associated with lower excess mortality.","Bjork, J.; Mattisson, K.; Ahlbom, A.",,536,20

This paper studies the uptake of AI-driven automation and its impact on employment, using a dynamic agent-based model (ABM). It simulates the adoption of automation software as well as job destruction and job creation in its wake. There are two types of agents: manufacturing firms and engineering services firms. The agents choose between two business models: consulting or automated software. From the engineering firms’ point of view, the model exhibits static economies of scale in the software model and dynamic (learning by doing) economies of scale in the consultancy model. From the manufacturing firms’ point of view, switching to the software model requires restructuring of production and there are network effects in switching. The ABM matches engineering and manufacturing agents and derives employment of engineers and the tasks they perform, i.e. consultancy, software development, software maintenance, or employment in manufacturing. We find that the uptake of software is gradual; slow in the first few years and then accelerates. Software is fully adopted after about 18 years in the base line run. Employment of engineers shifts from consultancy to software development and to new jobs in manufacturing. Spells of unemployment may occur if skilled jobs creation in manufacturing is slow. Finally, the model generates boom and bust cycles in the software sector.","Kyvik Nordås, Hildegunn; Klügl, Franziska",Front Robot AI,536,20

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been found to be expressed on type II pneumocytes. As a counterregulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 with human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have revealed that regulating the ACE2/RAS system was effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV. Vitamin D was found to affect ACE2, the target of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, we propose that vitamin D might alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2.","Xiao, Dongqiong; Li, Xihong; Su, Xiaojuan; Mu, Dezhi; Qu, Yi",Int J Infect Dis,536,16

Viral induced OP throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and H1N1 viral pandemics was well documented #2. The reported imaging findings of COVID-19 suggest that secondary OP may be occurring even more often #2. CASE PRESENTATION: 74-y-old man, evaluated in the emergency room for dry cough and asthenia with 1 week of evolution. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio: 276), and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted in the COVID department. Treatment with Dexamethasone 6mg was started but a week later (day 14 of illness) there was a clinical deterioration, with worsening of the respiratory insufficiency (PaO2/FiO2 ratio: 175), requiring introduction of non-invasive mechanical ventilation with high oxygen rates. A clinical and gasometrical improvement (PaO2/FiO2 ratio: 230»253) was then observed with slow reduction and weaning from corticosteroids at D10 of dexamethasone. At day 20 of the disease, there was a new clinical and gasometrical worsening (PaO2/FiO2: 162), and it was decided to restart dexamethasone 6mg. No clinical improvement was observed in the following days and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, revealing multiple peripheral areas of consolidation and bilateral ground glass opacities, suggestive of an OP-like pattern. Given these findings, the case was discussed in a multidisciplinary team reunion, who considered the diagnosis of OP secondary to COVID-19 infection. It was decided to initiate 'pulse-dose' methylprednisolone 1000mg IV for 3 days and posteriorly the dosage of steroids was tapered every 3 days. There was an abrupt reduction in oxygen and ventilatory support needs and he was discharge requiring only 1L of oxygen and showing significant radiological improvement. After 3 months of follow-up, chest CT scan revealed dramatic improvements regarding previous findings. DISCUSSION: The definitive role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diffuse lung injury is still unclear, but it is expected that it might induce host immune responses that damage the lungs. Corticosteroids, as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents, can reduce lung damage by regulating various inflammatory responses #3. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that corticosteroids may be an option to consider in COVID-19 pneumonia with an OP-like pattern. Secondary OP often requires prolonged corticosteroid treatment. It is important to increase recognition of this diagnosis, in order to start the appropriate treatment, which may lead to a reduction of the harmful consequences of COVID-19.

Despite the best efforts of scientists, no drugs against COVID-19 are yet in sight; five vaccines have received emergency approval in various countries, but it would be a difficult task to vaccinate twice the world population of 8 billion. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through in silico screening a number of phytochemicals in Allium cepa (onion) regarding their ability to bind to the main protease of COVID-19 known as the 3C-like protease or 3CLpro, (PDB ID: 6LU7), 3CLpro of SARS (PDB ID: 3M3V), and human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), [PDB ID: 1R42], which functions as a receptor for entry of the virus into humans. Molecular docking (blind docking, that is docking not only against any target pocket) were done with the help of AutoDockVina. It was observed that of the twenty-two phytochemicals screened, twelve showed good binding affinities to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, the compounds also demonstrated good binding affinities to ACE-2. It is therefore very likely that the binding affinities shown by these compounds against both 3CLpro and ACE-2 merit further study for their potential use as therapeutic agents.","Bondhon, T A; Fatima, A; Jannat, K; Hasan, A; Jahan, R; Nissapatorn, V; Wiart, C; Pereira, M L; Rahmatullah, M",Tropical biomedicine,536,33

We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices individuals make about monetary, health, and social rewards, and if these unprecedented conditions would have a differential impact on older individuals. We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards; stated preferences for monetary, health, and social rewards; and physical distancing behaviors. Both studies recruited equal numbers of White/Caucasian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx participants. We found that older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks. These data further support the assertion that older adults have increased motivation for social and health rewards compared to younger individuals and that these age differences in motivation are important to consider when examining decision-making across the adult life span.","Seaman, Kendra L; Juarez, Eric J; Troutman, Addison; Salerno, Joanna M; Samanez-Larkin, Silvia P; Samanez-Larkin, Gregory R","Neuropsychology, development, and cognition.

However, human and animal studies indicate that the majority of gut viruses infect villous enterocytes, Viruses appear to have different affinities for enterocytes at different sites on the villus. Infection of enterocytes leads to cell death, extrusion into the lumen, and villous atrophy when the rate of cell production in the crypts cannot keep pace with the rate of enterocyte loss. This results in a reduced surface area as well as impairment of digestive and absorptive functions. This may also result in a net secretory state. All these changes, along with others such as reduced enzymatic activity and reduced epithelial integrity, may contribute to the induction of an acute but transient malabsorptive diarrhoea which may persist until the digestive/absorptive functions of the enterocyte are restored. However, if colonic compensation is sufficient to handle the increased fluid load, diarrhoea may not be evident. The roles of villous ischaemia, altered countercurrent exchanger or altered immune responses still remain uncertain and require further investigation.","Salim, A.F.M.; Phillips, A.

Randomly administered surveys were completed from December 2019–March 2020 before community lockdown (n = 474) and repeated in April 2020 during lockdown (n = 194). Nearly universal (95%) income decline occurred during the lockdown and led to 88% of households reporting food insecurity. During lockdown, a quarter of households (n = 17) using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a cleaner cooking fuel typically available in pre-set quantities (e.g. 6 kg cylinders), switched to polluting cooking fuels (kerosene, wood), which could be purchased in smaller amounts or gathered for free. Household size increases during lockdown also led to participants’ altering their cooking fuel, and changing their cooking behaviors and foods consumed. Further, households more likely to switch away from LPG had lower consumption prior to lockdown and had suffered greater income loss, compared with households that continued to use LPG. Thus, inequities in clean cooking fuel access may have been exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdown. These findings demonstrate the complex relationship between household demographics, financial strain, diet and cooking patterns, and present the opportunity for a food-energy nexus approach to address multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): achieving zero hunger (SDG 2) and universal affordable, modern and clean energy access (SDG 7) by 2030. Ensuring that LPG is affordable, accessible and meets the dietary and cooking needs of families should be a policy priority for helping improve food and energy security among the urban poor.","Shupler, Matthew; Mwitari, James; Gohole, Arthur; Anderson de Cuevas, Rachel; Puzzolo, Elisa; Čukić, Iva; Nix, Emily; Pope, Daniel",Renew Sustain Energy Rev,536,18

Even with effective vaccines, infection is possible, and at-risk populations would benefit from effective drug compounds that reduce the lethality and lasting damage of COVID-19 infection. The CoV-2 MacroD-like macrodomain (Mac1) is implicated in viral pathogenicity by disrupting host innate immunity through its mono (ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase activity, making it a prime target for antiviral therapy. We therefore solved the structure of CoV-2 Mac1 from non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) and applied structural and sequence-based genetic tracing, including newly determined A. pompejana MacroD2 and GDAP2 amino acid sequences, to compare and contrast CoV-2 Mac1 with the functionally related human DNA-damage signaling factor poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Previously, identified targetable features of the PARG active site allowed us to develop a pharmacologically useful PARG inhibitor (PARGi). Here, we developed a focused chemical library and determined 6 novel PARGi X-ray crystal structures for comparative analysis. We applied this knowledge to discovery of CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors by combining computation and structural analysis to identify PARGi fragments with potential to bind the distal-ribose and adenosyl pockets of the CoV-2 Mac1 active site. Scaffold development of these PARGi fragments has yielded two novel compounds, PARG-345 and PARG-329, that crystallize within the Mac1 active site, providing critical structure-activity data and a pathway for inhibitor optimization. The reported structural findings demonstrate ways to harness our PARGi synthesis and characterization pipeline to develop CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors targeting the ADP-ribose active site. Together, these structural and computational analyses reveal a path for accelerating development of antiviral therapeutics from pre-existing drug optimization pipelines.","Brosey, Chris A.; Houl, Jerry H.; Katsonis, Panagiotis; Balapiti-Modarage, Lakshitha P.F.; Bommagani, Shobanbabu; Arvai, Andy; Moiani, Davide; Bacolla, Albino; Link, Todd; Warden, Leslie S.; Lichtarge, Olivier; Jones, Darin E.; Ahmed, Zamal; Tainer, John A.",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,536,1

However, vaccines are only effective if a community collectively uptakes vaccination. This approach is growing increasingly difficult with the emergence of ‘Vaccine Hesitancy.’ This paper aims to determine the association between university curricula and the degree of hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods The online questionnaire assessed demographic data, prior knowledge of vaccines, attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines using an adapted version of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group’s Vaccine Hesitancy Survey (VHS) and factors likely to motivate vaccine uptake. By using binary scoring, the degree of hesitancy among students was determined. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on VHS revealed underlying causes of hesitancy. To analyze the dependence between hesitancy and curriculum, a chi-squared test was conducted. Results Medical students scored higher for prior knowledge of vaccines (M = 3.54) as opposed to non-medical students (M = 3.49). Medical students responded favorably to COVID-19 vaccines with only 1.37% showing hesitancy for all nine items of VHS, compared to 2.55% of non-medical students. EFA produced three subscales within the VHS: lack of confidence, risk factor concern, and misinformation. The lack of confidence factor accounted for 65% of the data obtained. The chi-square test solidified that vaccine hesitancy is dependent on curriculum. Conclusion The majority of non-medical students showed hesitancy towards obtaining COVID-19 vaccines compared to medical students who were more willing, largely owing to their knowledge and understanding of vaccines.","Sadaqat, Waliya; Habib, Shanzay; Tauseef, Ambreen; Akhtar, Sheharyar; Hayat, Meryum; Shujaat, Syeda A; Mahmood, Amina",Cureus,536,29

Eleven residues within these regions were examined by mutational analysis. H636A, Y704A, and K706A greatly diminished the enzymatic activities and were unable to support the viral replication in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts.

The pandemic has also greatly influenced medical care systems for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Establishment of a global registry system and accumulated experiences have led to consensus for IBD management under the COVID-19 pandemic. IBD itself does not pose an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or aggravation of COVID-19, and immune-control treatments other than systemic steroids, such as biologics, are unlikely to increase this risk. The importance of suppressing disease activity has not changed since before the pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral changes and psychological states among patients have various results and differ by country or region as well as between adult and pediatric patients. In future, information-sharing tools that can widely and correctly disseminate the views of experts will be very important.

Although public health campaigns are increasing sun-protective behaviour in England, their effect on melanoma incidence is largely unknown. We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study to examine whether there have been changes in the epidemiology of melanoma in England during the past four decades. METHODS: Individual level data for patients diagnosed with melanoma in England during 1981–2018 were obtained from the Office for National Statistics/Public Health England. Average annual incidence rates were calculated by three age categories (0–34, 35–64, 65+ years), gender and anatomical site during the seven five-year time periods (1981–85 to 2011–15) and the recent three-year period (2016–18). The percentage change in incidence was calculated as change in the average incidence rate from the first (1981–85) to the last time period (2016–18). The Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) was estimated using the slope of the linear trend line fitted to the incidence rates by year of diagnosis. FINDINGS: During the 38-year period (1981–2018), a total of 265,302 cases of melanoma (45.7% males, 54.3% females) were registered in England. The average annual number of cases increased from 837/year in 1981–85 to 6963/year in 2016–18 in males (+732%), and from 1609/year in 1981–85 to 6952/year in 2016–18 in females (+332%). In the young age-group (0–34 years), the average annual incidence rates initially increased from 1981–85 to 2001–05 and then stabilised during the recent period (2006–18). In the middle age group (35–64 years), the rates increased by +332% (AAPC, 10.4%) in males (from 5.6/100,000 in 1981–85 to 24.2/100,000 in 2016–18) and +185% (AAPC, 5.7%) in females (from 10.2/100,000 in 1981–85 to 29.1/100,000 in 2016–18); and in the old age-group (65+ years) the rates increased by +842% (AAPC, 25.7%) in males (from 9.6/100,000 in 1981–85 to 90.4/100,000 in 2016–18) and +381% (AAPC, 11.2%) in females (from 12.5/100,000 in 1981–85 to 60.1/100,000 in 2016–18). The largest increase in incidence in both males and females was observed for melanoma of the trunk (+817%, AAPC, 24.8% in males and +613%, AAPC, 18.3% in females), followed by melanoma of upper limb (+750%, AAPC, 22.9% in males and 518%, AAPC, 15.5% in females). INTERPRETATION: It appears that the incidence of melanoma among young people in England has stabilised (or levelled off) in recent decades, whereas it continues to increase substantially in older population. These findings suggest that public health campaigns targeted at children/adolescents/parents may be favourably influencing melanoma incidence. The steeper increase in incidence in males is consistent with their relatively greater sun exposure and poor sun-protective behaviour. All the available evidence suggests that the enormous increase in the melanoma of the trunk and upper limb, since the 1980s, is most likely due to increasing trend in intermittent high intensity recreational UV radiation exposure (e.g. sunbathing, holidaying in places with strong sunlight, indoor tanning).

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has played a vital role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but the rates of false negatives is not ideal in dealing with this highly infectious virus. It is thus necessary to systematically evaluate the clinical performance of the single-, dual-, triple-target detection kits to guide the clinical diagnosis of this disease. Methods A series of reference materials calibrated by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and 57 clinical samples were used to evaluate the clinical performance of six single-, dual-, triple-target SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits based on RT-qPCR. Results The dual-target kits, kit B and kit C had the highest and the lowest detection sensitivity, which was 125 copies/mL and 4000 copies/mL, respectively. Among the 57 clinical samples from patients with COVID-19, 47 were tested positive by the kit B, while 35, 29, 28, 30, and 29 were found positive by the kits A, C, D, E, and F, respectively.

In this study, to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year). We confirmed that the substitution rate of the P203L is significantly higher than those of other variants containing mutations in structural proteins. Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing P203L mutation of nsp14 is limited (26), these mutants appeared at least 10 times independently in the current pandemic. These results indicated that the molecular function of nsp14 is important for survival of various coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and that some mutations such as P203L of nsp14 inhibiting its error-correcting function are removed rapidly due to their deleterious effects.","Takada, Kosuke; Ueda, Mahoko Takahashi; Watanabe, Tokiko; Nakagawa, So",bioRxiv,536,29

No reports encompass any conclusive confirmation of vertical transmission. Nevertheless, cases of fetal distress and multiple organ failure have been reported, as well as rare cases of fetal demise. While clinicians and scientists continue to seek proof of vertical transmission, they miss the greater point, namely the cause of preterm delivery. In this review, we suggest that the cause might not be due to the viral infection but the fetal exposure to maternal inflammation or cytokine storm that translates into a complication of COVID-19. This statement is extrapolated from previous experience with infections and inflammation which were reported to be fatal by increasing the risk of preterm delivery and causing abnormal neonatal brain development and resulting in neurological disorders like atypical behavioral phenotype or autistic syndrome. Given the potentially fatal consequences on neonate health, we highlight the urgent need for an animal model to study vertical transmission. The preclinical model will allow us to make the link between SARS-COV-2 infection, inflammation and long-term follow-up of child brain development.","Joma, Mohamed; Fovet, Claire-Maelle; Seddiki, Nabila; Gressens, Pierre; Laforge, Mireille",Vaccines (Basel),536,2

Aim This study aimed to elucidate area level characteristics linked to testing rates. Methods Free-of-charge diagnostic tests (PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 was made available to the general public in late June 2020 in Uppsala County, Sweden, at four main test stations, and to a lesser extent at other health care units. We analysed 35,794 tests performed on individuals from 346 postal codes, from 24 June to 12 October 2020. Results We observed varying testing rates across postal code areas within Uppsala City as well as in Uppsala County. Testing rates were lower in areas characterized by longer distance to the nearest test station, lower neighbourhood deprivation index indicating higher deprivation (NDI) and higher proportion of inhabitants with foreign background. Multivariable regression models could not separate influences of foreign background and NDI on COVID-19 testing rates as these were collinear. Further, we did not detect any association between COVID-19 hospitalization rates and testing rates, indicating that underlying community infection rates did not substantially affect test frequency during this period. Conclusion We observed that testing rates were associated with distance to test station and socioeconomic and demographic circumstances. As lower testing rates can contribute to inequity in pandemic health effects, there is an urgent need to ensure adequate test accessibility in all parts of society.","Kennedy, B.; Martinell, M.; Hammar, U.; van Zoest, V.; Kristiansson, R.

Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses, including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.","Low, Zheng Yao; Yip, Ashley Jia Wen; Sharma, Anshika; Lal, Sunil K.",Virus Genes,536,1

To increase political legitimacy and accountability, public support is important. This study examines what criteria beyond medical need are deemed important to be perceived of priority COVID-19 healthcare access. METHOD: Two conjoint experiments about priority over ICU treatment and early COVID-19 vaccination were implemented in a probability-based sample of 1461 respondents representative of the Netherlands. Respondents were asked who should receive treatment out of two fictitious healthcare claimants that differed in in age, weight, complying with corona policy measures, and occupation, all randomly assigned. Average marginal coefficient effects are estimated to assess the relative importance of the attributes; attributes were interacted with relevant respondent characteristics to find whether consensus exists in this relative ranking. RESULTS: The Dutch penalize those not complying with coronavirus policy measures, and the obese, but prioritize those employed in ‘crucial’ sectors. For these conditions, there is consensus among the population. For age, young people are prioritized for ICU treatment, while the middle-aged are given priority over a vaccine, with younger respondents favoring healthcare for elderly claimants, while older respondents favor support for young cohorts. CONCLUSION: People who have no control over their social risk and are able to reciprocate to society are considered as more deserving of priority of COVID-19 healthcare. Our findings provide fair support for the implemented ethical guidelines about ICU-treatment and COVID-19 vaccines.

The current and predicted development trends in applied technologies affecting industry worldwide as formulated in the Industry 4.0 initiative have clearly emphasized the needs for constantly adapting curricula. The sensible socioeconomic changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have induced significant challenges to society in general and industry. Higher education, specifically when dealing with Industry 4.0, must take these new challenges rapidly into account. Modernization of the industrial engineering curriculum combined with its migration to a blended teaching landscape must be updated in real-time with real-world cases. The COVID-19 crisis provides, paradoxically, an opportunity for dealing with the challenges of training industrial engineers to confront a virtual dematerialized work model which has accelerated during and will remain for the foreseeable future after the pandemic. The paper describes the methodology used for adapting, enhancing, and evaluating the learning and teaching experience under the urgent and unexpected challenges to move from face-to-face university courses distant and online teaching.

METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study reporting the first three months (April to June 2020) of the experience of implementing a low-cost telemedicine emergency care program in a public tertiary hospital. The service was available to patients up to 18 years of age enrolled in this hospital. A tool for assessing the severity of the patient was developed, the aim of standardizing the procedure, while maintaining quality and safety. Guardian's satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire sent after teleconsultations. RESULTS: 255 teleconsultations were carried out with 140 different patients.

In this context, we set out the channels through which food prices will be affected by the Covid‐19 pandemic, emphasising the short‐ and longer‐term nature of the main effects. We focus on the UK but the insights extend to other (importing) countries. Drawing on a recent econometric model of UK retail food prices that accounts for both domestic and international factors, we show that the key drivers have potentially off‐setting effects, suggesting that the Covid‐19 shock to the food sector is likely to be different from previous shocks, particularly the commodity price crises of 2007–2008 and 2011. In many European countries, the Covid‐19 pandemic may manifest itself as something of an ‘odd crisis’, in which lower world and farm‐gate prices co‐exist with higher domestic retail prices.

The change in biophysical properties like the refractive index of blood plasma due to the production of antibodies during infection may be very helpful in estimating the level and intensity of infection and subsequent treatment based on blood plasma therapy. In this article, Fano resonance-based refractive index sensor using plasmonic nanomatryoshka is proposed for blood plasma sensing. The interaction between hybridized modes (bright and dark modes) in optimized nanomatryoshka leads to Fano resonance, which by virtue of steeper dispersion can confine the light more efficiently compared with Lorentzian resonance. We propose the excitation of Fano resonances in sub 100-nm size nanomatryoshka based on newly emerging plasmonic materials ZrN and HfN, and one of the most widely used conventional plasmonic material, Au. Fano resonance-based plasmonic sensors leads to sensitivity = 188.5 nm/RIU, 242.5 nm/RIU, and 244.9 nm/RIU for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively. The corresponding figure of merit (nm/RIU) is ~ 3.5 [Formula: see text] 10(3), 3.1 [Formula: see text] 10(3), and 2.8 [Formula: see text] 10(3) for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively.

These contaminants induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, triggering the inflammatory response that alters cell and tissue homeostasis and facilitates the development of diseases. The effects of air pollutants such as ozone, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM0.1), and indoor air pollutants on respiratory health have been widely reported. For instance, epidemiological and experimental studies have shown associations between hospital admissions for individual diseases and increased air pollutant levels. This review describes the association and relationships between exposure to air pollutants and respiratory viral infections, especially those caused by the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. The evidence suggests that exposure to air contaminants induces inflammatory states, modulates the immune system, and increases molecules’ expression that favors respiratory viruses’ pathogenesis and affects the respiratory system. However, the mechanisms underlying these interactions have not yet been fully elucidated, so it is necessary to develop new studies to obtain information that will allow health and policy decisions to be made for the adequate control of respiratory infections, especially in the most vulnerable population, during periods of maximum air pollution.","Loaiza-Ceballos, María Camila; Marin-Palma, Damariz; Zapata, Wildeman; Hernandez, Juan C.",Air Qual Atmos Health,536,3

Beyond causing respiratory distress, COVID-19 may also cause mortality by way of suicide. The pathways by which emerging viral disease outbreaks (EVDOs) and suicide are related are complex and not entirely understood. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between EVDOs and suicidal behaviors and/or ideation. An electronic search was conducted using five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus in April 2020. A rapid systematic review was carried out, which involved separately and independently extracting quantitative data of selected articles. The electronic search yielded 2480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the data were collected in Hong Kong (n = 3) and the USA (n = 3). Four studies reported a slight but significant increase in deaths by suicide during EVDOs. The increase in deaths by suicide was mainly reported during the peak epidemic and in older adults. Psychosocial factors such as the fear of being infected by the virus or social isolation related to quarantine measures were the most prominent factors associated with deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Overall, we found scarce and weak evidence for an increased risk of deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Our results inform the need to orient public health policies toward suicide prevention strategies targeting the psychosocial effects of EVDOs. High-quality research on suicide risk and prevention are warranted during the current pandemic.","Leaune, Edouard; Samuel, Maeva; Oh, Hans; Poulet, Emmanuel; Brunelin, Jérôme",Prev Med,536,20

From the data collected in Sao Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters and calculated the basic reproduction number as R0 = 6.828. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied the releasing proportions of young and elder persons to assess their epidemiological impacts. The best scenarios were release of young persons, but maintaining elder persons isolated. To avoid the collapse of the health care system, the isolation must be at least 80%.","Yang, H.

Expert opinion and scientific societies recommend a higher dose of low-molecular-weight heparin, but definitive data is lacking. We report our adapted thromboprophylaxis practice of low-molecular-weight heparin administration in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients. One-hundred six measurements in 19 ICU patients were collected. Despite enoxaparin 60 mg once daily, only two measurements of the trough anti-Xa were in the upper end of prophylactic range. Anti-Xa activity peaks increased significantly after administration, but all measurements were under the optimal prophylactic ranges. Despite an adapted protocol, three of the 19 patients (16%) developed venous thromboembolism. We show in coronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients, despite higher prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin administration due to body mass index, anti-Xa activity was well below peak serum levels in our cohort of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This evaluation suggests the need for rapid studies on adequate thromboprophylaxis in these patients.","Piagnerelli, Michaël; Cauchie, Philippe; Vancutsem, Maxime; Thooft, Aurélie; Zouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim; Biston, Patrick; Wautrecht, Jean-Claude",Crit Care Explor,536,20

The extent and success of such measures has varied. Many jurisdictions with declines in reported COVID-19 cases are moving to relax measures, while others are continuing to intensify efforts to reduce transmission. Aim: We aim to determine the time frame between a change in COVID-19 measures at the population level and the observable impact of such a change on cases. Methods: We examine how long it takes for there to be a substantial difference between the cases that occur following a change in control measures and those that would have occurred at baseline. We then examine how long it takes to detect a difference, given delays and noise in reported cases. We use changes in population-level (e.g., distancing) control measures informed by data and estimates from British Columbia, Canada. Results: We find that the time frames are long: it takes three weeks or more before we might expect a substantial difference in cases given a change in population-level COVID-19 control, and it takes slightly longer to detect the impacts of the change. The time frames are shorter (11-15 days) for dramatic changes in control, and they are impacted by noise and delays in the testing and reporting process, with delays reaching up to 25-40 days. Conclusion: The time until a change in broad control measures has an observed impact is longer than is typically understood, and is longer than the mean incubation period (time between exposure than onset) and the often used 14 day time period. Policy makers and public health planners should consider this when assessing the impact of policy change, and efforts should be made to develop rapid, consistent real-time COVID-19 surveillance.","Stockdale, J.

This patient had a pre-existing inflammatory disease, having recently developed ulcerative colitis antenatally. Five days prior to admission, she had tested positive asymptomatically on a SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase PCR nasopharyngeal swab. The positive swab result was confirmed on admission. Clinical examination revealed bilaterally exaggerated knee reflexes, lower limb weakness and positive Babinski’s sign. Sensation was impaired at L4 and L5 dermatomes and absent at S1 and S2. MRI findings suggested longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis, with multiple regions of patchy hyperintensity seen in the thoracic region of the spinal cord both centrally and peripherally. She was started on a course of intravenous corticosteroids and improvement was seen both clinically and on repeat imaging. This case demonstrates a rare complication to an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and explores the potential neurotropic properties of COVID-19.","Lee, Gabriel",BMJ Case Rep,536,17

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. METHODS: We performed 12‑lead ECGs and 12‑lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged <80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days. A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control. RESULTS: Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria. ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc ≥ 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p < .01) compared with those with QTc < 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had ≥1 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4). No patients showed “R on T"" premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. CONCLUSION: Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable.","Cipriani, Alberto; Zorzi, Alessandro; Ceccato, Davide; Capone, Federico; Parolin, Matteo; Donato, Filippo; Fioretto, Paola; Pesavento, Raffaele; Previato, Lorenzo; Maffei, Pietro; Saller, Alois; Avogaro, Angelo; Sarais, Cristiano; Gregori, Dario; Iliceto, Sabino; Vettor, Roberto",Int J Cardiol,536,1

For the historical and humanistic purposes, this history‐in‐the‐making needs to be archived and analyzed. Using the query “china+and+coronavirus” to scrape from the Twitter API, we have obtained 3,457,402 key tweets about China relating to COVID‐19. In this archive, in which about 40% of the tweets are from the U.S., we identify 25,467 Hate Speech occurrences and analyze them according to lexicon‐based emotions and demographics using machine learning and network methods. The results indicate that there are substantial associations between the amount of Hate Speech and demonstrations of sentiments, and state demographics factors. Sentiments of surprise and fear associated with poverty and unemployment rates are prominent. This digital archive and the related analyses are not simply historical, therefore. They play vital roles in raising public awareness and mitigating future crises. Consequently, we regard our research as a pilot study in methods of analysis that might be used by other researchers in various fields.","Fan, Lizhou; Yu, Huizi; Yin, Zhanyuan",Proc Assoc Inf Sci Technol,536,15
